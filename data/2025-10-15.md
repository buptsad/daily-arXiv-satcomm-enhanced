### [1] [Stable and Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Traffic Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11937)
*Arjun Devraj,Umesh Krishnaswamy,Ying Zhang,Karuna Grewal,Justin Hsu,Eva Tardos,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A decentralized traffic engineering (TE) system, Symphony, reduces divergence-induced congestion and blast radius in cloud WANs by combining quadratic regularization for robust allocations and randomized slicing to distribute critical sources, achieving near-coordinated behavior without explicit coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud providers seek fault isolation in TE to localize controller failures, but autonomous slice controllers can diverge, causing congestion. There is a need for algorithmic stability and architectural resilience in decentralized TE.

Method: Introduce quadratic regularization to TE objectives to stabilize allocations and enable natural convergence without coordination. Develop a randomized slicing algorithm to partition the network and spread critical traffic sources across slices to minimize blast radius. Evaluate on cloud WAN traces to compare with current practice.

Result: Symphony substantially reduces divergence-induced congestion (about 14x) and greatly lowers blast radius (about 79%) compared to current practice.

Conclusion: The combination of regularization and intelligent slicing yields robust, scalable decentralized TE, preserving fault isolation while approaching coordinated performance. The approach is promising for real-world cloud WAN deployments, with future work on scalability and dynamic traffic.

Abstract: Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic
engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In
the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the
network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we
find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic
allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present
Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of
divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of
decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization,
Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE
controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination.
In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to
minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices,
preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations
work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic
allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the
network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony
reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared
to current practice.

### [2] [A Network Digital Twin of a 5G Private Network: Designing a Proof-of-Concept from Theory to Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12458)
*Cristina Emilia Costa,Tatenda Horiro Zhou,Fabrizio Granelli*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper reports a practical Network Digital Twin (NDT) for a real 5G private network, implemented with open-source emulation tools, demonstrated to closely reproduce the actual system, and released as open source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are many theoretical works on Network Digital Twins but few real implementations; there is a need to validate NDT capabilities for analyzing and predicting 6G network behavior and to provide an open, usable platform.

Method: The authors build an NDT using open-source network emulation software on a real 5G private lab network, linking physical infrastructure and digital twin, and perform measurements on both to validate accuracy; the NDT is released as open source for community use.

Result: The Network Digital Twin achieves high accuracy in reproducing the state and behavior of the actual 5G system, with measurements validating close correspondence between the real network and its twin.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the practicality of Network Digital Twins for 6G network analysis and prediction, and provides a concrete, open-source implementation to foster broader adoption and experimentation.

Abstract: Network Digital Twins represent a key technology in future networks, expected
to provide the capability to perform accurate analysis and predictions about
the behaviour of 6G mobile networks. However, despite the availability of
several theoretical works on the subject, still very few examples of actual
implementations of Network Digital Twin are available. This paper provides a
detailed description about the characteristics of Network Digital Twin and
provides a practical example about real deployment of the technology. The
considered network infrastructure is a real 5G private network running in a
lab. The Network Digital Twin is built based on open source network emulation
software and is available to the community as open source. Measurements on both
the physical infrastructure and the related Digital Twin demonstrate a high
accuracy in reproducing the state and behavior of the actual 5G system.

### [3] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor is an ICU mortality prediction framework with intrinsic interpretability that integrates clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness via two modules: Prognostic Clinical Course Identification (prototype learning with prognostication-aware regularization) and Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition (cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments). It outperforms baselines and its interpretations are human-evaluated as clinically meaningful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate and interpretable ICU mortality prediction that aligns with key ICU decision-making practices (clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, prognostication awareness). Traditional methods emphasize demographics and lack integration of clinical course and prognostication awareness, hindering trust and regulatory compliance.

Method: ProtoDoctor introduces two innovations: (1) Prognostic Clinical Course Identification module using prototype learning to identify clinical courses, augmented with a novel regularization mechanism to achieve prognostication awareness; (2) Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module modeling heterogeneity via cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments.

Result: ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy; human evaluations indicate its interpretations are more clinically meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three ICU decision-making elements into its reasoning, supporting clinical trust and regulatory alignment.

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

### [4] [Schrödinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829)
*Jin Ma,Ying Tan,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 引入软约束 Schrödinger 桥问题（SCSBP），以惩罚项代替硬边界，建立存在性与收敛性结果，并分析对生成建模、微调与迁移学习的鲁棒性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统硬终端约束在高维或数据稀缺场景中的不稳定性，提升通过参考边际到目标分布的鲁棒性与灵活性。

Method: 将 SCSBP 视为带有 McKean-Vlasov 类型的随机控制问题；利用 Doob 的 h-变换、Schrödinger 势的稳定性、伽马收敛，以及一个耦合的优化-熵最优传输的固定点框架，证明最优解存在；并证明随着惩罚项增加，控制与价值函数线性收敛到经典 SBP 的解。

Result: 给出对软约束桥的第一组定量收敛保证；证明对任意惩罚水平存在最优解；当惩罚项趋向无穷时，解收敛到经典 SBP，且收敛速率为线性。

Conclusion: 惩罚正则化提升鲁棒性，便于生成建模、微调与迁移学习的应用，同时提供了一个理论框架来分析软约束下的生成过程，并揭示了从软约束到硬约束的定量收敛关系。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

### [5] [Z0-Inf: Zeroth Order Approximation for Data Influence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11832)
*Narine Kokhlikyan,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的零阶近似方法来估计训练数据对模型预测的影响，基于训练过程中的中间 checkpoint 的损失值与 checkpoint 本身，适用于不可微的损失函数，特别擅长估计自我影响，且在大模型上具有良好准确性与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据对模型行为的影响对数据选择、模型调试等应用至关重要。现有影响评估方法要么精度不足，要么计算成本高，难以扩展到大模型。需要一种更高效、可扩展的影响估计方法。

Method: 提出一种 zeroth-order（零阶）近似，仅使用训练与测试数据在中间 checkpoint 的损失值及这些 checkpoint 本身来估计数据的影响，不依赖梯度或海森矩阵逆等高成本运算。该方法对自我影响有更高的准确性，在对微调后的大语言模型的 train–test 影响估计上也具有可比或更优的表现。

Result: 在自我影响的估计上实现了更高的准确性，在微调的大型语言模型上对 train–test 影响的估计达到可比或提升的准确性，并显著提升了计算效率与可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析训练数据如何塑造模型行为提供一个可扩展且实用的工具，尤其在数据质量评估与模型诊断场景中具备实际价值。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

### [6] [Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11834)
*Sarah Ball,Andreas Haupt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Boundary Guidance 的 RL 微调方法，通过显式远离分类边界来提升生成模型的安全性与效用，在 jailbreaker/模糊提示基准上，显示优于仅对模型进行边界端点削弱的策略，且对模型规模和奖励设计具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对生成模型进行安全过滤的微调，倾向降低被分类器过滤的概率，但往往把模型推向分类边界，导致较高的假阳性和假阴性。需要一种方法在不被边界诱导的情况下提升安全性与可用性。

Method: 提出 Boundary Guidance，一种基于强化学习的微调方法，明确地让生成偏离分类器的边界，从而降低触发边界的概率，结合安全分类器作为奖励信号对输出进行引导。对 jailbreaker/模糊提示基准进行评估，并通过 LLM 作为评判者的评估来衡量安全性与实用性。对模型规模和奖励设计进行广泛消融，验证方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 在 jailbreaker 和模糊提示基准上，Boundary Guidance 同时提升了输出的安全性与实用性，且通过“LLM 作为评判者”的评估得到正向结果。对不同模型规模和不同奖励设计的消融分析显示方法具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 显式地通过 RL 将生成远离分类边界可在安全性与实用性之间取得更优的权衡，且该方法对模型规模和奖励设计相对鲁棒。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

### [7] [WaveletDiff: Multilevel Wavelet Diffusion For Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11839)
*Yu-Hsiang Wang,Olgica Milenkovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveletDiff 在小波系数上进行扩散模型训练，利用多尺度结构生成高质量时间序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量时间序列稀缺问题，并通过使用小波分解实现对多尺度结构的有效建模。

Method: 将扩散模型直接应用于时间序列的小波系数；为各分解层设计专门的Transformer，并通过跨层注意力和自适应门控实现时序与频率尺度间的信息交流；基于 Parseval 定理引入能量保持约束以保持谱保真度。

Result: 在六个真实数据集（能源、金融、神经科学领域）上，WaveletDiff 在短时和长时序上均优于时域与频域的最前沿生成方法；多项指标中平均 discriminative score 与 Context-FID 分数比第二名低约3倍。

Conclusion: 将扩散建模与多分辨率小波结构对齐能够显著提升时间序列生成性能，具有较强的广义性及潜在的跨域适用性。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

*Urs Spiegelhalter,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对话题：在继续预训练中通过回放比进行数据再训练对新任务的适应与知识保留的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解在计算预算受限的情况下，如何在学习新能力和防止遗忘之间取得最佳权衡；探究合成数据生成与回放比在持续预训练中的作用。

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成，系统性地评估不同的总 token 预算和回放比配置；衡量在任务掌握和一般知识保留上的影响。

Result: 发现存在一个能在任务特定表现与通用知识保留之间取得平衡的最优配置；给出基于计算预算的回放比经验性指南，以降低训练成本、实现强任务适配。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据回放比的策略，研究者和从业者可以在受限计算资源下，实现高效的任务适配，同时保持对现有知识的保留。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 七种前沿视觉-语言模型在多模态讽刺检测与解释生成上的评估：对比零-shot/一-shot/少-shot提示，发现二元检测有中等表现，但缺乏高质量解释，需任务特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源VLM在理解复杂而主观的多模态现象（如讽刺）方面的能力，特别是评估其在讽刺检测和解释生成上的潜力与局限性。

Method: 对七种主流VLM（BLIP2、InstructBLIP、OpenFlamingo、LLaVA、PaliGemma、Gemma3、Qwen-VL）在Muse、MMSD2.0、SarcNet等讽刺数据集上进行零-shot、单-shot和少-shot prompting评估，并评估其生成对讽刺实例的解释能力。

Result: 模型在二元讽刺检测上取得中等水平的成功，但在不进行任务特定微调的情况下，难以生成高质量的解释。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在讽刺检测和解释方面尚未达到稳健水平，需针对任务进行微调以提升可解释性与准确性，并为未来研究指明改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在过程分析中引入时间序列的 actor 行为信息可提升吞吐时间的预测性能；基于 actor 的时序特征显著优于仅使用吞吐时间特征的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPM 需要预测未来行为、结果或性能指标。由于过程资源驱动性，参与者/演员的行为对结果具有潜在影响，且这一信息作为随时间变化的信号在现有研究中应用不足。

Method: 从真实事件日志构建多变量时间序列，包含吞吐时间 TT 与与演员相关的特征（参与度、继续/中断/移交的频率、这些行为的持续时间等），训练并对比多种模型以评估添加演员行为信息带来的收益。

Result: 引入演员信息的模型在 RMSE、MAE、R^2 等指标上持续优于只包含 TT 的基线模型，表明随时间演变的演员行为信息能提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 将演员行为作为时间序列特征进行建模并融合到预测模型中，可以提升过程性能指标的预测准确性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

### [11] [Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868)
*Rita T. Sousa,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的知识图嵌入学习框架，利用显式声明的负关系，通过双模型并行训练并互相产生负样本，在一般性和领域特定的知识图上提升链路预测和三元组分类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入方法常以闭世界或局部闭世界假设为前提，将缺失三元组视为假；实际知识图往往符合开放世界假设，显式的负声明稀缺且常被忽视，亟需充分利用负信息以区分错误与未知.

Method: 提出双模型结构，两套嵌入模型并行训练，一套处理正向声明，另一套处理负向声明。训练阶段，两模型通过对正样本进行扰动（污染/替换）来生成负样本，并通过对方模型给出的分数挑选最具潜在性的负样本进行对比学习与优化。

Result: 在通用和领域知识图上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法在链路预测和三元组分类等任务上优于现有最先进的嵌入模型，证明将显式负知识融入嵌入学习的价值。

Conclusion: 将显式负知识通过双模型训练融入KG嵌入学习，提升了对开放世界假设下的表示学习效果，表明负信息对区分错误与未知具有显著的帮助。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

*Xiaohang Tang,Zhuowen Cheng,Satyabrat Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CART 通过在变换器策略中引入基于NashQ的阶段博弈和保守转移不确定性的约束，以提高对抗性随机博弈中的鲁棒性与保守性，从而提升最坏情况性能与 minimax 值估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的决策变换器在对抗性扰动和随机转移下的鲁棒性不足；需要一个将对手策略性利用抑制与对过渡不确定性保守处理结合的框架。

Method: 将博弈过程分解为阶段博弈，收益定义为后续状态的期望最大值；利用阶段博弈导出的NashQ值对Transformer策略进行条件化；在此基础上训练的CART既具对抗性鲁棒性又对转移不确定性保守。

Result: 在多种对抗性随机博弈中，CART在 minimax 值估计上更准确，且在最坏情形回报方面表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 首次提出在对抗性随机环境中提升DT鲁棒性的框架，CART 能同时实现对抗性鲁棒与对转移不确定性的保守性，提升最坏情形表现。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

*Chenliang Li,Junyu Leng,Jiaxiang Li,Youbang Sun,Shixiang Chen,Shahin Shahrampour,Alfredo Garcia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaRL提出自适应低秩策略表示以鲁棒强化学习来应对环境动力学的模型不确定性。通过双层优化：下层在固定秩约束下以Wasserstein球内的动力学样本进行策略优化；上层自适应调整秩，并将策略参数投影到低秩流形，从而避免对抗最坏情形的高成本和过度保守。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒RL多依赖嵌套的min–max优化，计算成本高且可能产生过度保守的策略。需要对任务的内在维度进行自适应匹配，以实现鲁棒性与参数效率之间的平衡。

Method: 在下层，给定固定秩约束，在质心模型周围的Wasserstein球内对动力学进行采样，并据此进行策略优化；在上层，动态调整秩以权衡偏差-方差，并将策略参数投影到低秩流形以实现自适应降维。该设计避免直接求解对抗最坏动力学，同时保持鲁棒性且降低参数化规模。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准上，AdaRL持续优于固定秩基线（如SAC）和现有鲁棒RL方法（如RNAC、Parseval），并且收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为鲁棒RL提供了一个高效且具原理性的替代方案，能够在模型不确定性下实现鲁棒性，同时减少过度参数化。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model

### [14] [Integrating Sequential and Relational Modeling for User Events: Datasets and Prediction Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11903)
*Rizal Fathony,Igor Melnyk,Owen Reinert,Nam H. Nguyen,Daniele Rosa,C. Bayan Bruss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified datasets and formalism for joint modeling of personal and relational user events; empirical evidence that combining both improves performance; public resources released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world user behavior includes both personal actions and inter-user interactions; these two types are often modeled separately, typically as sequences or graphs. This separation limits predictive power; there is a lack of public datasets and a unified formalism to capture both. Addressing this gap can enhance modeling and generalization.

Method: Introduce a collection of datasets that include both personal and relational events; propose a unified formalization that integrates sequence- and graph-based representations; conduct empirical evaluations showing benefits of jointly modeling both event types; release these resources to the community.

Result: Empirical experiments indicate that models benefiting from incorporating both personal and relational events outperform those modeling them separately; results also suggest room for methodological improvement in the unified approach.

Conclusion: Provide public datasets and tasks for unified user event modeling and encourage further progress in integrating personal and relational event modeling.

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

*Nayan Sanjay Bhatia,Pranay Kocheta,Russell Elliott,Harikrishna S. Kuttivelil,Katia Obraczka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Locaris是一种解码器仅限的大型语言模型（decoder-only LLM），将每个接入点（AP）的测量视为一个token，直接从原始Wi-Fi遥测推断设备位置；无需预处理，能通过对不同Wi-Fi数据集微调实现 calibration-free 的回归映射，在多种条件下实现子米级定位，且对新设备和新部署具有良好适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  indoor Wi-Fi 定位面临环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异质性高度敏感的问题，传统指纹和基于模型的方法需要大量标定且在设备、信道或部署条件变化时性能下降；需要一种可扩展、无需繁琐标定且对异构部署具有鲁棒性的定位方案。

Method: Locaris采用解码器型的端到端LLM，將每个AP测量作为token输入，直接对原始Wi-Fi遥测进行处理，无需传统的预处理或特征工程。通过在不同的Wi-Fi数据集上对LLM进行微调，使其学习从原始信号到设备位置的轻量且具有广泛泛化性的映射。该方法还支持少量标定点下的快速适应，对未见设备和部署情景保持高精度，并在缺失AP的情况下也能保持鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明Locaris在多种遥测类型下均可与现有最先进方法相媲美甚至超越，且具备 calibration-free 的回归能力、跨环境鲁棒性以及子米级精度（仅需数百个样本）。对新设备、部署条件及缺失AP的情形表现出稳健性，支持任意可用遥测输入，展现了在大规模部署中广泛适用性的潜力。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLMs可作为无需标定的回归模型用于室内定位，具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，适用于无法进行广泛标定的大规模Wi-Fi部署场景。Locaris为现实世界中的室内定位提供了实用性验证，证明了calibration-free、跨环境的高性能定位的可行性。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

TL;DR: 提出三种高效的重启范式以应对模型无关非平稳强化学习中的记忆丢失和预定性重启问题，并在多环境下对比，显著降低动态 regret。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Mao et al. (2022) 的 RestartQ-UCB 在重启设计中的两个核心问题：完全遗忘和按预定时机重启，提升对环境动态变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，修改 RestartQ-UCB 与 RANDOMIZEDQ（Wang et al., 2025），在多环境中进行经验评估，比较对比并衡量动态 regret 的下降幅度。

Result: 在多种环境中实现近似最优的经验表现，相比 RestartQ-UCB，动态 regret 下降最多达到 91%。

Conclusion: 三种重启范式有效降低遗忘、提高对环境动态的适应性，提升模型无关非平稳 RL 的性能稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

### [17] [Sculpting Latent Spaces With MMD: Disentanglement With Programmable Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11953)
*Quentin Fruytier,Akshay Malhotra,Shahab Hamidi-Rad,Aditya Sant,Aryan Mokhtari,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KL-VAE 正则化在因子分离上表现不可靠；作者提出一个基于 MMD 的可编程先验框架，能够实现更强的独立性和对潜在变量的语义对齐，同时在不牺牲重构的情况下保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习可解耦的潜在表征是机器学习的核心目标之一。但现有的 KL 正则化难以确保聚合后验的因子化独立性，导致表征的 entanglement。需要一种直接、可编程的先验机制来塑造潜在空间，并提供无监督的量化(entanglement)手段。

Method: 提出可编程先验框架（Programmable Prior Framework），基于最大均值差（MMD）来显式设计潜在空间的先验分布；引入 Latent Predictability Score (LPS) 作为无监督的 entanglement 指标；在 CIFAR-10 和 Tiny ImageNet 上演示实现的特征独立性提升，并避免常见的重构权衡。

Result: 与传统的 KL 正则相比，框架在潜在变量的相互独立性方面达到更高的评估值（state-of-the-art 的互信息/独立性指标），并能通过可编程先验对 semantically meaningful features 进行对齐；同时保持或改善重构性能，无需牺牲重构。

Conclusion: 为表征工程提供了基础工具，提升模型可 identifiability 与因果推理的潜力。可编程先验为复杂数据集上的解耦表示提供了新的研究路线和实际应用能力。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出Y形生成流，通过沿共享路径大规模移动概率质量并在末端分支，以非线性（0到1之间的凹型）运输成本提升协同性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的连续时间生成模型常以V形轨迹独立地把样本从先验移动到数据分布，忽略结构化的共享信息。

Method: 引入以速度驱动的运输成本，幂指数在0到1之间的凹函数，鼓励联合快速移动，并在可扩展的神经ODE训练目标中实现；在Y形策略中先沿共享路径传输，再对目标分布分支。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物数据集上，Y流展现出对层级结构的更好把握、比强基线在分布度量上更优、并以更少的积分步数达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流有效地捕捉层级结构，提升生成效率和质量，是对传统V形流的有力扩展。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

*Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Cong Zeng,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff通过轨迹感知的结构裁剪，将扩散预训练的学习速率差异映射到后训练采样加速，实现在不损害输出质量的前提下显著加速采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练阶段呈现多阶段的学习速度差异，现有的后训练加速方法未能对这种差异做出有效适配，需将预训练学习动力学与采样加速对齐。

Method: 提出基于轨迹的结构裁剪（trajectory-aware structural pruning）：在预训练的中速学习阶段采用保守裁剪以保留关键特征，在早期和晚期慢速阶段采用更激进的裁剪，使裁剪强度随学习速率变化而自适应。并在DiT与SDXL上进行验证，强调裁剪策略与学习速率的耦合。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上实现显著的采样加速，且输出质量未降低，优于先前的最先进方法，提供了一种新的、训练无关的 diffusion 加速视角。

Conclusion: 该方法首次明确地将扩散预训练的学习速率变化映射到采样阶段的裁剪策略，统一了模型的内部训练动力学与采样加速，提出了一个高效、鲁棒的训练无关 diffusion 加速新路径。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

*Aditya Gupta,Kirandeep Kaur,Vinayak Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 QLENS，一种基于物理学的 Transformer 生成功能框架，将激活映射到希尔伯空间的态矢量，并通过单位算子与哈密顿量实现层间演化，最终用 Born 规则得到输出分布；在一个 toy Transformer 上给出概念性证明，研究单个层对预测轨迹的影响，作为跨领域理解 Transformer 的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合 Transformer 的可解释性缺口：缺乏对每一层如何促进从一个中间状态转变到下一个状态的系统性、数学化描述。同时，语言模型的概率性本质与量子力学的核心假设之间的相似性启发了将物理学框架应用于 NLP 的可能性。

Method: 将模型的潜在激活映射到由输出单元派生的希尔伯空间中的态矢量；将隐层视为单元性算子和相应的哈密顿量，沿推理过程进行演化；通过对末态应用 Born 规则和特定测量算子来获得最终概率分布。以一个 toy Transformer 进行概念性验证，探查各层对预测轨迹的影响。

Result: 作为概念性证明，在 toy Transformer 上给出初步的可行性证据，显示框架能够揭示并量化各层对预测过程的影响，验证了将量子力学框架应用于 Transformer 的可行性。

Conclusion: QLENS 为跨领域的理解框架奠定基础，未来工作将扩展至更大规模模型、进行定量分析，并探索在实际NLP任务中的实用性与泛化能力。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

### [21] [Learning Dynamics of VLM Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11978)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 CW-DPO：一种面向学习动力学的两阶段视觉-语言模型对齐微调方法。阶段1使用温和负样本进行监督微调以平滑学习动态，阶段2在 DPO 目标中引入冷却权重来放缩负项，以抑制简单或分布外样本的无信息梯度，同时保留困难负样本信号。在训练中使用 Δlog p 指标进行早停与课程设计。实验证明 CW-DPO 比 SFT-only 和原始 DPO 更稳定、校准更好、对仿真对中的胜率更高，且收敛更快，消融表明冷却权重机制是主要驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好式微调的脆弱性在于错误的负样本会产生无信息梯度，扰乱训练。需要将对齐问题与学习动力学联系起来，设计能显式建模训练轨迹的优化方法，以提高稳定性、校准和样本对比度。

Method: 两阶段方法：阶段1 采用温和负样本的有监督微调，即低权重、平滑化的监督信号，用以正则化基础策略并抑制过度自信；阶段2 引入 DPO 目标，负样本项按冷却权重缩放，冷却权重由模型对每个负样本的平均 token 对数概率决定，以抑制简单样本或分布外样本的无信息梯度，同时保留难负样本信号。训练中重点使用 on-policy 负样本，并通过混合数据集负样本实现对比的新鲜感；并用 Δlog p 指标对 positives/negatives 进行信号化监测，用于早停、课程设计与故障诊断。

Result: 在多种 VLM 任务上，CW-DPO 相比 SFT-only 和 vanilla DPO 展现出更稳定的优化过程、较好的校准、以及更高的成对胜率，同时收敛步数更少。消融实验表明冷却权重机制是主要驱动因素，混合 on-policy 与数据集负样本也提供额外好处。

Conclusion: 通过在“在 cooling 之前平滑学习动力学”这一简单原则来实现对齐的鲁棒性，CW-DPO 提供了一种通用的学习动力学感知优化框架，可提升视觉-语言模型的对齐效果。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using the exact Hessian rather than its approximations can destabilize neural network training, challenging the presumed benefits of second-order methods and the ubiquity of local minima in loss landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether true curvature information (the exact Hessian) can improve neural network optimization and understand why it may fail, contributing to the understanding of loss landscape geometry.

Method: Systematically compare exact Hessian-based steps with quasi-Newton and first-order methods on neural networks, and analyze the observed failure modes to reveal geometry of discretizations and stationary points.

Result: Neural network training reliably fails when relying on exact curvature information; failure modes provide insights into discretization geometry and the distribution of stationary points, prompting reevaluation of the idea that loss landscapes are full of local minima.

Conclusion: Caution against assuming curvature-based methods will improve training; the loss landscape may not be dominated by local minima, and curvature usage requires careful consideration of discretization and optimization dynamics.

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种在联邦学习中的蓄意公平性攻击：单个恶意客户端通过增加公平性损失来训练偏见模型，即使数据分布同质也能提升偏见，同时保持全局准确性，在多种鲁棒聚合策略下测试，偏见提升可达约90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在保护隐私的同时易受污染与偏见传播的影响。现有对抗与鲁棒聚合方法对对抗性公平性攻击的检测与防御不足，因此需要系统评估此类攻击对公平性的影响及其对现有防御的韧性。

Method: 提出一个将公平性作为优化目标的损失项，恶意客户端在训练时主动增大该公平性损失以提升偏见（如人口统计平等性、公平机会等），并与当前最先进的 Byzantine-robust 与 fairness-aware 聚合策略进行对比评估，覆盖多数据集与多场景设置。

Result: 在存在单个恶意客户端的场景中，偏见提升可达到约90%，且在保持全局准确度的前提下提升偏见；攻击在不同数据集与设定下对比攻击都显示显著提升偏见，表明现有防御对该类型蓄意公平性攻击的鲁棒性有限。

Conclusion: 该攻击具有隐蔽性和易被现有鲁棒聚合策略忽略的风险，提示需要改进公平性监测、鲁棒聚合与对抗性评估，以提高联邦学习系统对蓄意偏见攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

TL;DR: Mamba通过测试时学习特征来实现高效的 in-context learning（ICL），在低维非线性目标函数下（单索引模型 y ≈ g_*(⟨β, x⟩)）能从上下文样本中直接提取相关方向β。研究表明，预训练的 Mamba 在理论上可实现高效 ICL，且测试时的特征学习提高了样本效率。其非线性门控机制是特征提取的关键驱动因素，赋予模型在计算效率与性能之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示 Mamba 的 ICL 机制的理论基础，弥补其在效率与理论理解之间的空白，并比较其测试时学习能力与线性/非线性变换器在样本复杂度上的差异。

Method: 以单索引模型的低维非线性目标函数为研究对象，分析在经过梯度方法预训练后的 Mamba 在上下文中进行测试时特征学习的能力；证明通过测试时特征学习可以从上下文中直接提取相关方向β，实现 ICL；并比较其样本复杂度与线性/非线性 Transformer 的关系，强调非线性门控对特征提取的作用。

Result: 得到的理论结果显示：1) 通过测试时特征学习，Mamba 能实现有效的 ICL；2) 测试时样本复杂度优于分析为核方法的线性 Transformer，且与已证明超越 CSQ 下界并接近信息论最优速率的非线性 Transformer 相当；3) 非线性门控是实现特征提取与良好 ICL 的关键机制。

Conclusion: 非线性门控是驱动 Mamba 在高效计算与强性能之间取得平衡的根本原因；该分析将 Mamba 的 ICL 能力与特征提取能力联系起来，为线性时间模型在上下文学习中的理论理解提供新的视角。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户在LLMs中使用私密信息，需实现安全、加密通信；同态加密可在加密数据上进行计算，但文本生成（尤其是下一个词预测）仍是实践中的主要难题，制约了隐私友好交互的普及。

Method: 提出基于TSP的令牌重排序策略与一个后处理步骤以降低近似误差；结合理论分析与实验评估，证明该策略在HE下的文本生成可减少崩塌、提升连贯性并维持隐私。

Result: 理论分析与实验结果表明，该方法可防止生成过程的崩塌，提升文本连贯性，并在加密推断过程中保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该工作推动在隐私保护前提下的LLM推断的实用化，提升了HE条件下文本生成的可行性与安全性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

Method: 基于视觉自回归建模，构建生成式分类器；提出Adaptive VAR Classifier+（A-VARC+），在准确性-推理速度之间实现更优折衷；利用可显式对数似然实现 token 级互信息以实现可解释性，并在类增量学习中表现出对灾难性遗忘的抵抗性。

Result: A-VARC+ 在准确性与推理速度的权衡上优于 baseline VAR，且与扩散方法相比展现出不同的性质；可通过 token-wise mutual information 进行可解释性；在类增量学习中显示对灾难性遗忘的固有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VAR 基于生成式分类器提供了可解释性和持续学习方面的潜在优势，挑战与应用性更广泛；未来工作可进一步探讨不同自回归结构、推理效率优化及在更广泛任务中的适用性。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出 MEASURE 框架用于领域泛化的睡眠分期，通过多尺度对比学习降低领域相关信息，同时保留时间-频率特征，在 SleepEDF-20 与 MASS 数据集上优于现有方法，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有睡眠分期模型在未知受试者上的泛化能力差，领域之间的生理信号存在分布差异导致性能下降。需要在不丢失重要时间-频率信息的前提下学习领域不变表征；对比学习在跨域对齐方面有效，但现有方法未充分处理样本中隐藏的领域特征，导致域相关信息仍然存在。

Method: 提出 MEASURE 框架（Multi-scale minAl SUfficient Representation lEarning），通过多尺度特征层次同时减小领域相关信息并保持关键时间与频谱特征，用对比学习实现跨域对齐，避免高层信息过拟合，同时兼顾多尺度的时频信息。

Result: 在公开的睡眠分期基准数据集 SleepEDF-20 与 MASS 上，提出的方法持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效降低域相关信息并保留对睡眠阶段判别有用的时间–频谱信息，MEASURE 提高了睡眠分期的跨域泛化能力，结果具有一定的鲁棒性和实用性，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 H4G 框架，通过学习可调的分块对角缩放矩阵与 Möbius 矩阵乘法，降低超曲面嵌入半径以保留细粒度结构信息，从而提升文本-图关系的零样本学习性能；在异质图和同质图上分别达到显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于双曲空间的图表示在大半径下进行过度抽象，模糊了局部模式，导致对细粒度结构的丢失，影响零样本学习的精度。需要在保持全局感受野的同时， faithful 保留局部结构信息。

Method: 提出 H4G 框架，通过学习得到的分块对角缩放矩阵和 Möbius 矩阵乘法来系统性地缩小嵌入半径，使模型能访问更细粒度的模式，同时保持较低的计算开销。

Result: 在零样本任务中，H4G 显著提升性能：异质图上提升 12.8%，同质图上提升 8.4%，验证了半径缩小有助于实现多尺度、但保真度高的表示。

Conclusion: 降低嵌入半径以保留细粒度模式，是实现对图-文本零样本学习的可行路径，兼具全局感受野和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 动态稀疏训练结合模块特定训练（MST）能够在深度强化学习中提升扩展性，克服大模型导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习中，模型规模扩大常导致性能下降，源自独特的优化路径ologies（如plasticity loss）及对编码器、评估器、执行者等模块的不同学习范式。现有工作在全局性动态训练、缺乏对不同模块的针对性处理、以及缺少对稀疏–稀疏、密度–稀疏、稀疏–密集等动态策略的系统比较。

Method: 对编码器、评估器、执行者等模块在不同学习范式下应用不同的动态训练策略，比较稀疏–稀疏、密集–稀疏、稀疏–密集等策略对模块和架构的影响，进行跨架构与多种RL算法的系统评估。提出 Module-Specific Training (MST) 框架，将动态训练与架构改进结合，在不修改算法核心的前提下提升可扩展性。

Result: 动态稀疏训练在不同模块上提供模块特定的益处，与架构改进带来的提升互为补充，显著提升多种RL算法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: MST 框架通过模块级别的动态训练与架构改进的耦合，实现对深度RL的更强可扩展性，适用于多种算法与任务，且不需要对算法本身进行改动。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: 提出 Chimera，一种统一的状态空间模型，通过直接将数据拓扑纳入建模，去除了对领域特定偏置的需求，在语言、视觉和图领域表现出色，并给出了时间复杂度和近似优化以提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自注意力将数据视为无序元素集合，忽略拓扑结构，需要手工设计位置嵌入或随机游走等偏置，易影响泛化；需要一种能通用地捕获图拓扑的模型。

Method: 将状态空间模型推广到图拓扑，直接将数据拓扑融入模型，省略位置嵌入；对有向无环图可实现线性时间递推；对一般图通过简单数学放松使注意力复杂度从平方降低到可控。

Result: 在语言、视觉、图领域取得强于基线的结果：在GLUE上超越BERT 0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上超越ViT 2.6%，并在Long Range Graph Benchmark上领先所有基线。

Conclusion: 数据拓扑是强大的归纳偏置，Chimera 的统一框架验证了拓扑在多模态任务中的有效性与通用性，同时给出可观的效率改进。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

TL;DR: nuGPR 在高计算成本的高斯过程回归训练中，结合了预条件共轭梯度、基于聚类的区块对角化及低秩块近似、数值梯度超参数优化和 CUDA 并行化，显著降低训练时间和峰值内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程回归的训练成本高，核心在于线性求解与超参数优化，占用大量时间与内存；现有基于 GPU 的实现受限，需要一个端到端、可扩展的加速框架。

Method: 采用预条件化共轭梯度法加速 GPR 中的线性求解；利用输入数据聚类发现协方差矩阵的块对角结构，并对块的非对角部分进行低秩近似；使用数值梯度来优化超参数以避免反向传播；基于 CUDA 的高效并行化实现。

Result: 与最佳现有的基于 GPU 的实现相比，nuGPR 将总训练时间提升幅度达到约 2 倍，峰值内存降低至原来的约 1/12，且在多种合成及真实数据集上得到验证。

Conclusion: nuGPR 提供一个端到端的 GPR 训练加速框架，通过整合数值线性代数技术和 GPU 并行化，实现显著的时间与内存效率提升，具有良好的可扩展性和适用性。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Result: 在广泛的实验设置中，GRACE 持续优于现有基线方法；代码可获取。

Conclusion: 通过结合自适应谱操作与跨集分布校准，GRACE 能在异质局部结构和分布偏差场景显著提升图少样本学习的泛化性。

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Motivation: 在现实世界中生存分析数据常受删失（右删失）与标注成本约束影响。有限预算下如何有效获取信息、提升预测性能，是提高数据收集效率和模型鲁棒性的关键问题。

Method: 将预算学习/主动学习框架应用于生存数据，允许对删失实例进行部分或全面标注（例如获取具体生存时间），并给出等价于BatchBALD的界限与渐近复杂度；通过实验验证在多项生存任务中优于其他方法。

Result: 提出的模型在若干生存任务基准上表现优于其他潜在方法；理论方面给出上限界和时间复杂度与BatchBALD一致的结果；实验显示在不同数据集上具有稳定的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将预算化主动学习思想移植到带删失的生存分析，提供理论界限与实现路径，并讨论在真实数据收集中的局限性与应用前景。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 自我验证的反思能显著提升极小型变换器的推理表现；在验证误差被有界的前提下，即使只有数百万参数也能达到接近大语言模型的整数乘法和数独表现；强化学习提升了分布内性能但并未实质减少验证误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解析大语言模型的推理过程中的自我反思机制为何能带来经验提升，且现有结果显示模型对CoT中的错误检测能力有限。为避免语言依赖带来的干扰，提出一个最小化、非语言化的推理框架，用于小型变换器，以便理论与实验上都能清晰地分离反思的效应，并给出严格的理论保证。

Method: 提出一个非语言化、极简的推理框架，使小型变换器具备基本自我验证的反思能力；给出理论分析，证明若验证错误被良好界定/有界，则自我验证反思可带来改进；在数百万参数的极小型变换器上进行训练与反思执行的对比实验，任务包括整数乘法和数独；探讨强化学习对模型表现及反思频次的影响，并分析其对验证误差的影响。

Result: 在训练和反思执行中，极小型变换器从自我验证中获益，取得接近大语言模型水平的整数乘法与数独表现；强化学习提高了分布内性能并促使更频繁的反思，但主要优化的是浅层统计模式，未能有效降低验证误差；反思能力的提升与生成-判别式验证结合，能够提升CoT推理的有效性。

Conclusion: 将生成式变换器与判别式验证相结合的自我反思机制能够普遍促进CoT推理的有效性，与模型规模和是否使用自然语言无关。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗场景中，ETSC 对时效性与准确性存在权衡；早期信号弱、类别不平衡和可解释性需求使现有方法难以在早期阶段充分发现 discriminative shapelets，提升诊断效率和资源利用。

Method: 提出 DE3S：1) 双重增强策略（传统时序增强 + 基于注意力的全局时序增强）以稳健学习；2) 基于注意力分数的软形状子序列稀疏化，保留判别模式并将不重要形状子序列聚合为代表性 token；3) 双路径 MoE 与 Inception 融合结构，MoE 在形状子序列内进行局部学习，Inception 捕捉跨形状子序列的全局模式；并采用加权交叉熵应对类别不平衡。

Result: 在六个真实医疗数据集上实现了当前最优性能；消融研究证实各组件的有效性；对主体间一致性数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DE3S 有效解决 ETSC 的准确性与早量性矛盾，提升早期诊断的可解释性与应用潜力，具备较强的泛化性，可用于监测如 ICU 的严重疾病预测等场景。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Conclusion: 在快速采样与可解释性之间架起桥梁，为可解释的图像合成提供新范式，推动可控且高效的扩散式生成模型的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA：为每个输入的分子图生成专用的低秩适配权重，动态注入到冻结的LLM中，实现实例级对齐；在分子任务上显著优于静态适配基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态对齐方法要么对LLM进行微调、要么使用静态适配器，导致全局参数共享且难以捕捉单个分子结构特征；微调LLM还容易造成灾难性遗忘，削弱通用推理能力。需要一种不改动LLM核心知识、具备实例级个性化适配的方案。

Method: 提出 Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation（MoRA），为每个输入分子图输出一组独特的低秩适配权重并动态注入到冻结的LLM中，使模型就地对分子结构进行推理时获得个性化改造；保持LLM参数不变，避免忘记效应；实现对分子图的实例级对齐。

Result: 在关键分子任务上，MoRA的实例级动态适配优于静态适配基线；化学反应预测的精确匹配提升约14.1%（相对），量子性质预测误差下降约22%；代码公开。

Conclusion: MoRA实现了不改变LLM核心知识的前提下，对分子输入进行个性化对齐，提升了分子推理任务的性能，展示了分子-LLM 集成的潜力与可扩展性。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

### [39] [Optimal Regularization for Performative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12249)
*Edwige Cyffers,Alireza Mirrokni,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在表演性学习中，模型部署会使数据分布发生偏移；高维岭回归下，正则化可缓解该偏移，且在过参数化 regime 下效果甚至有利，最优正则化随表演性强度而定，并在仿真与真实数据上得到验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据分布会因模型的部署而产生反应性变化，这种表演性效应使传统监督学习的假设受损，因此需要研究如何通过正则化提升对这类分布 shifts 的鲁棒性。

Method: 分析高维岭回归在表演性效应下的风险表现，推导正则化对测试风险的影响，以及最优正则化随表演强度的尺度关系；通过理论推导并在合成数据与真实数据上进行实验验证。

Result: 总体分布下，表演性效应会恶化测试风险；在过参数化的情形下，表演性效应也可能带来潜在的收益。最优正则化参数与表演性强度呈显著相关，这使得在部署前可据此设定正则化以对冲预期的表演性影响。实验结果支持该结论，且在合成数据和真实数据集上均有体现。

Conclusion: 正则化是应对表演性学习的有效工具，尤其在特征数量大于样本数量的情形中，通过根据表演性强度调整正则化，可以提升模型部署后的鲁棒性与性能。该结论为实际应用中的正则化选择提供定量指导，并在实证数据上得到验证。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

The paper provides a comprehensive, up-to-date survey and a dual-axis taxonomy to organize the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize and organize the growing literature on diffusion-based RL, clarify where diffusion models fit in the RL pipeline, and provide a roadmap for advancing the field amid single-agent and multi-agent settings.

Method: Literature survey and synthesis that (i) introduces fundamental diffusion model concepts, (ii) establishes a dual-axis taxonomy: function-oriented (roles of DMs in the RL pipeline) and technique-oriented (online vs offline learning), (iii) extends analysis from single-agent to multi-agent contexts, (iv) categorizes applications, discusses open issues, and (v) points to future directions and a GitHub repository for resources.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based approaches hold strong promise for advancing RL across diverse domains. The survey provides a clear taxonomy, maps existing methods, and outlines open problems and future directions to accelerate progress in DM-RL.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

### [42] [HiLoRA: Adaptive Hierarchical LoRA Routing for Training-Free Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12266)
*Ziyi Han,Huanyu Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Xiangxiang Dai,Xutong Liu,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA是一种训练无关的分层路由框架，通过对LoRA池的自适应路由实现域泛化，无需任务标签或额外训练，在序列级和标记级上进行鲁棒选择，理论上具有高概率选中相关LoRA的保证，实验显示对基线提升可达55%且吞吐量相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将LoRA用于域泛化时，通常依赖明确的任务标签或额外训练，且常对整个LoRA模块采取固定激活，导致参数冗余或性能不足。因此缺乏无训练成本的、灵活的域泛化方案。

Method: 提出HiLoRA——一个训练无关的框架，对LoRA池执行自适应的分层路由。将LoRA分解为秩-一分量（ROCs），每个秩参数视为独立单元。给定输入序列时，先基于序列级的高斯似然性自适应选择子集LoRA并对其ROCs分配，随后在标记级进一步通过激活最具信息的ROCs进行细化路由。并给出理论保证，HiLoRA能以高概率选择出最相关的LoRA。

Result: 大量实验表明，HiLoRA在域泛化任务中显著提升，对比先进基线的准确率提升高达55%，且推理吞吐量保持在可比水平。还提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供一种实用且无训练成本的LoRA自适应路由框架，具备理论保证和强实证性能，是域泛化任务中对LoRA重用的一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将自我改进方法扩展到多智能体的联合行动上，在每一步同时预测完整的智能体-任务分配；通过集合预测损失监督多种专家分配以利用对称性；并行产生多智能体行动以提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自我改进在训练开销和对多智能体协同建模方面的局限性：单动作轨迹的监督难以利用智能体排列对称性，且难以进行跨度更大的多智能体协同。

Method: 将自我改进拓展为对联合多智能体行动的迭代预测；模型在每个决策步同时输出完整的智能体-任务分配；采用集合预测损失，对任意给定状态的多个专家分配进行监督；并行生成多智能体行动以加速自我改进循环。

Result: 在若干组合优化问题上取得稳定的性能提升，且与标准自我改进相比，生成延迟显著降低；证据显示方法在求解质量与效率上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了样本效率和学习协同能力，适用于多智能体组合优化，并通过对称性建模实现更高的泛化和协同行为。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

*Fei Ren,Sifan Wang,Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Hai-Sui Yu,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的 Fourier 特征物理信息极限学习机（GFF-PIELM），通过在 ELM 的隐藏层引入基于傅里叶特征的激活函数、为隐藏神经元分配频率系数，并通过观测输出权重分布来初始化超参数，以有效处理高频/可变频 PDE，且在不增加训练时间或结构复杂性的前提下提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 PI 悬ect ELM 在求解包含高频和变量频率行为的偏微分方程时存在挑战，需要在保持简洁高效的前提下提高对高频成分的建模能力。

Method: 将傅里叶特征映射改造为 ELM 的一个傅里叶基激活函数，维持单隐藏层结构；为隐藏神经元分配一组频率系数，使 ELM 能捕捉目标解的多种频率分量；通过一种简单的初始化方法，根据输出权重分布来确定这些超参数。

Result: 通过五个案例研究共十个数值样例，验证了 GFF-PIELM 相较于传统 PIELM 在高频、可变频、多尺度、边界不规则及反问题等场景下的预测精度提升，同时保持训练时间和架构复杂度不增加。

Conclusion: 表明 PIELM 可以扩展以高精度求解高频偏微分方程，所提初始化策略也有望为其他物理信息机器学习框架带来启发。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

*Florent Delgrange,Raphael Avalos,Willem Röpke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 DeepSPI：一种在在线强化学习中受限于当前策略邻域的安全策略改进框架，并在世界模型与表征学习下给出理论保證，且在 ALE-57 上达到或超过 PPO 等基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的 SPI 保证多针对离线、表格型 RL，缺乏对在线、深度 RL 的理论与实践。需要将 SPI 引入带世界模型和表示学习的在线设置，建立从预测损失到表征质量的联系。

Method: 建立理论框架，限定策略更新在当前策略的邻域内以实现单调改进与收敛；将状态转移和奖赏预测损失与表征质量联系起来，给出在线的深度 SPI 类比；提出 DeepSPI：一个 on-policy 算法，将局部转移和奖赏损失与正则化策略更新耦合。

Result: 理论上证明单调改进和收敛性；把预测误差与表征质量的关系嵌入深度在线情形，推出在线深度 SPI 的等价物；在 ALE-57 基准上 DeepSPI 与 PPO、DeepMDPs 等强基线相当甚至更好，同时保留理论保证。

Conclusion: DeepSPI 提供了一个带理论保证的在线 SPI 框架，并在实验上表现出色，证明了将 SPI 原则应用于带世界模型和表示学习的在线深度 RL 的可行性。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 首次给出单时间尺度 actor-critic 在奖励函数演化情形下的有限时间收敛分析；在奖励参数缓慢演化时达到 O(1/√T) 收敛，并提升马尔可夫采样下的分布不匹配分析（对 static 奖励的 log^2 T 提升）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在广泛的实践 RL 算法中，随着奖励函数通过奖励塑形、熵正则化或课程学习而演化，理论基础不足的问题，给出对单时间尺度 actor-critic 的非渐近界和收敛性。

Method: 在马尔可夫采样下，允许奖励参数逐步在每个时间步改变，分析 actor 与 critic 的非渐近误差；假设常规条件，奖励更新为梯度规则且梯度有界；与 actor、critic 同步时间尺度；对分布不匹配给出新的分析。

Result: 证明在奖励参数缓慢演化下，达到 O(1/√T) 的收敛速率，等价于静态奖励情形；若奖励更新采用有界梯度的梯度规则并与 actor、critic 同步，则该速率保持。次要贡献：在马尔可夫采样下，对分布不匹配的新分析，将静态奖励情形下最优界的收敛率提升了 log^2 T。

Conclusion: 为将奖励演化纳入实际 RL 技术的理论提供基础，表明慢速演化的奖励不会破坏最优的 O(1/√T) 收敛性，并推动对分布不匹配的更精确界；为未来涉及动态奖励的 RL 设计和理论研究提供方向。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

TL;DR: 跨模态错误检测在表格数据中的初步基准：在四个数据集和五个基线下评估跨模态错误检测，与 AutoML 结合时 Cleanlab 与 DataScope 表现最佳，但在真实大规模、长尾数据上仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量在大规模、多模态数据场景下极其关键。现有错误检测多聚焦单一模态（表格），易错过跨模态错误，尤其在电商、医疗等领域的图像/表格/文本共存场景。需要建立跨模态表格数据的基准评估并推动方法改进。

Method: 对跨模态表格数据的错误检测进行基准评估，比较五个基线方法在四个数据集上的表现，并将结果与一个强 AutoML 框架结合。评估指标包括 F1 分数，特别关注跨模态错识和数据质量。

Result: 在与 AutoML 框架搭配时，Cleanlab 和 DataScope 表现最佳，达到最高的 F1 分数；总体而言，现有方法在 heavy-tailed 的真实世界数据上仍显不足。

Conclusion: 当前跨模态表格数据错误检测的研究尚处于起步阶段，需进一步研究以提升对大规模、长尾分布数据的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Motivation: 解决标注数据稀缺带来的挑战；现实世界的图通常是异构的，存在显著的语义失配问题，现有自监督方法多针对同质图且对迁移性支持不足。

Method: 设计结构感知预训练任务以捕捉异构图的结构特性；设计语义感知预训练任务，通过构造包含语义邻居的扰动子空间来缓解语义失配；在大规模异构图上进行预训练并在下游任务上进行微调。

Result: 在真实的大规模异构图数据集上，所提框架在多项下游任务上显著优于当前最优基线。

Conclusion: 通过结构与语义两条线索提升异构图GNN的自监督预训练效果，语义邻居扰动子空间是缓解语义失配的关键；代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Cautious Weight Decay (CWD)，是一行、与优化器无关的修改；仅对更新方向符号与参数坐标一致的权重衰减，能保持原始损失不变并具备双层解释（滑模行为），可作为 AdamW、Lion、Muon 等的直接替代，在大规模语言模型预训练和 ImageNet 分类任务上提升最终损失和准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与标准的解耦权重衰减不同，CWD 旨在避免改变原始优化目标（损失函数），通过仅对符号对齐的分量施加衰减，避免对整体现有目标的额外正则化，同时提供一种对未修改目标的局部帕累托最优点的搜索机制（通过滑模行为实现）。

Method: 在任意优化器中作为单行改动实现，对权重衰减仅作用于与优化器更新符号一致的参数坐标；具有双层（bilevel）解释：达到驻点流形时产生滑模行为，从而在未修改的目标上搜索局部 Pareto 最优的驻点；无需新增超参数，且可替换如 AdamW、Lion、Muon 等优化器。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和 ImageNet 分类等百万至十亿参数规模的任务中，CWD 具有在最终损失和准确率上的一致性提升。

Conclusion: CWD 提供一个简单、无额外超参数的 Drop-in 方案，保持原始目标不变的同时提升大规模模型的表现，适用于多种优化器。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评价生成无机晶体的距离函数存在四个主要局限：无法量化相似度程度、无法区分成分差异与结构差异、对原子坐标的位移缺乏Lipschitz连续性、以及对生成样本的置换不具不变性。这导致唯一性与新颖性度量不可靠。

Method: 从理论出发定义两种连续距离函数，用以同时评价成分-结构的差异、对坐标位移的鲁棒性、以及对样本置换的不变性；并通过实验比较新旧距离函数在生成无机晶体的模型中的表现，验证其改进点。

Result: 新距离函数在实验中揭示传统距离函数未能捕捉的洞见，提供更可靠的评估与比较基准，用以衡量生成模型在无机晶体领域的性能。

Conclusion: 两种连续距离函数为晶体生成模型的评估提供更稳健的工具，未来可扩展至更多材料系统与不同距离度量的研究，以促进公平且可重复的比较。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 利用高斯过程的贝叶斯优化为动态定价提供非参数解，适用于无限/有限库存两类情景，给出渐近性/ regrets 保证并在实验中优于多种强化学习基线，具有更强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在价格对需求响应的未知情况下，传统的参数化需求模型可能不符合现实，需高效、鲁棒且无须强假设的定价策略。

Method: 将需求视为价格的黑盒函数，使用高斯过程进行非参数建模，并基于贝叶斯优化进行价格优化；针对无限库存与有限库存两种情形给出相应的近似策略与 regret 保证。

Result: 实验证明所提 BO 方法在收入方面优于若干前沿 RL 算法，并且对模型假设要求更少，鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 基于高斯过程的非参数化动态定价框架在不确定环境中具有实用性和鲁棒性，贝叶斯优化提供了一种高效的样本利用方案，适用于复杂市场。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

### [52] [A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 锋度（sharpness）并非单纯的“差越大越差”的判定，而是与具体任务和模型的函数（function）相关。传统认为平坦极小值易泛化，但最近研究表明，正则化下的“更尖锐”的极小值也可能带来更好的泛化、校准和鲁棒性，因此应采用以函数为中心的 loss landscape 评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期普遍观点认为平坦极小值与良好泛化相关，但理论反例与经验性例外揭示了锋度的局限性。需要重新审视尖锐性在不同函数、正则化策略和任务中的含义，提出一种以函数为中心的损失景观分析框架。

Method: 进行广泛的经验研究：覆盖单目标优化和现代图像分类任务；对比不同正则化方法（如 SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下的极小值形状与模型性能；评估尖锐性与泛化、校准、鲁棒性及功能一致性之间的关系；分析未正则化基线与正则化模型在极小值几何上的差异。

Result: 在正则化存在时，尖锐极小值往往与更好的泛化、校准和鲁棒性并存；未正则化基线趋于更平坦的极小值，但整体性能往往较差。总体上，函数复杂性决定了解的几何形状，而“尖锐”极小值可以反映更合适的归纳偏置，强调以函数为中心的损失景观评估。

Conclusion: 应从单纯的平坦度转向函数复杂性与 inductive biases 的综合考量，重新评估尖锐性在损失景观中的角色，提出以函数为核心的 loss landscape 解释框架。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

### [53] [Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12453)
*Viacheslav Vasilev,Arseny Ivanov,Nikita Gushchin,Maria Kovaleva,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM)，将桥接模型扩展到时序相关的视频数据，在扩散桥采样中直接建模跨序列时间相关性，在帧内插、图像到视频生成与视频超分辨率等任务上优于传统方法与扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在数据到数据转换中存在困难，桥接模型能够学习数据分布间的变换，但其对时间相关数据的应用研究不足，导致视频生成/编辑中的时间一致性受限。

Method: 将桥接框架扩展到时间相关的视频序列，显式建模跨序列依赖，并将时序相关性直接融入采样过程。

Result: 在帧插补、图像到视频生成、视频超分辨率等任务中，在多项定量指标上实现优于经典方法与扩散模型的性能，提升生成质量和重建保真度。

Conclusion: TCVBM 有效提升基于桥接的时间相关视频任务的性能，证明在视频领域将时间相关性引入力扩散桥的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

*Beibu Li,Qichao Shentu,Yang Shu,Hui Zhang,Ming Li,Ning Jin,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossAD 提出了一种面向时间序列异常检测的跨尺度与跨窗口框架，通过跨尺度重构与全局多尺度上下文来捕捉尺度间的动态关系与更丰富的上下文信息，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多尺度建模要么在尺度之间的关系建模不足，要么采用简单特征融合，且多采用固定滑动窗口，无法灵活捕捉异常过程中的跨尺度和跨时间上下文。需要一种能建模跨尺度关联动态变化并超越固定窗口限制的方法。

Method: 提出 CrossAD，包含跨尺度重构以从粗尺度重建细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关系；设计查询库并引入全局多尺度上下文，以缓解固定窗口带来的信息丢失，同时进行跨窗口建模以丰富上下文。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上进行九项评估指标的实验，结果显示 CrossAD 具有对比方法的显著优势，达到了当前的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD 有效地结合跨尺度关联与跨窗口建模，提升时间序列异常检测的准确性与鲁棒性，证明跨尺度信息在异常检测中的重要作用。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种两方垂直联邦学习的新范式 PubSub-VFL，利用发布/订阅架构实现层次化异步以提升训练效率，并通过系统画像优化超参数以应对资源和数据异质性；在理论上可稳健收敛并兼容差分隐私，在五个公开数据集上实现2–7倍训练加速、资源利用率最高达 91.07%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据隐私保护前提下，解决垂直联邦学习中同步依赖导致的低资源利用率和训练延迟，以及参与方的资源和数据异质性带来的计算瓶颈。

Method: 设计 PubSub-VFL，结合发布/订阅的解耦与参数服务器的数据并行性，提出层次化异步机制以降低延迟；基于参与者的系统特征建立最优超参数选择的优化问题以缓解异质性影响；给出收敛性理论分析，并证明其与差分隐私等安全协议的兼容性。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL 能高效地进行两方协作学习，显著提升计算资源利用和训练效率，同时兼容隐私保护机制，具备良好的扩展性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

*Jincheng Zhong,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) 来纠正扩散模型采样过程中的噪声错位问题。通过显式让采样轨迹与预定义噪声日程对齐，并提供 classifier-free 版本以实现无外部分类器的训练；在 ImageNet 及多项任务上实证提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于离散化逆向 SDE/ODE 的扩散模型在采样阶段存在一种长期被忽视的噪声错位问题：预先设定的噪声水平与中间状态实际携带噪声之间不一致，导致生成效果受限、跨分布泛化差和去噪更新不准确。

Method: 提出 Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG)，在采样过程中显式纠正轨迹，使其与预定义噪声日程保持一致。并进一步提出 classifier-free 变体，通过噪声条件 dropout 同时训练一个有噪声条件和一个无噪声条件的模型，避免对外部分类器的依赖。

Result: 实验结果显示 NAG 能持续缓解噪声错位，显著提升主流扩散模型的生成质量，且在 ImageNet 生成以及多项监督微调任务上具有一致性改进。

Conclusion: NAG 为扩散模型提供一个简单而有效的噪声一致性纠错框架，提升采样稳定性与生成质量；分类器自由版本进一步降低了部署复杂度。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

*Huiyang Yi,Yanyan He,Duxin Chen,Mingyu Kang,He Wang,Wenwu Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对八种模型假设违背下的主流因果发现算法进行大规模基准测试，聚焦差分可微分（differentiable）方法在结构汉明距离（SHD）和结构干预距离（SID）等评估指标上的鲁棒性，唯有尺度变化情形表现出明显劣势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果发现方法往往依赖不可证伪的因果假设，现实数据往往违背独立同分布（i.i.d.）且难以验证，因此需要系统评估在这种假设违背下的算法鲁棒性与可迁移性，并为现实应用提供基准与理论解释。

Method: 在八种模型假设违背情形下，系统性基准测试主流因果发现算法（包括可微分/ differentiable 方法及其他常见方法），以推断出的因果图与真图之间的结构性距离（SHD、SID）为评估指标，并给出理论分析来解释可微分方法的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，差分可微分因果发现方法在大多数挑战性场景下对推断图的SHD和SID具有鲁棒性，唯一例外是尺度变化情形；同时给出解释这些现象的理论依据。

Conclusion: 本工作建立了一个全面的基准标准，评估近期可微分因果发现方法在模型假设违背下的表现，旨在为合理评估提供标准、促进在真实世界场景中的应用，并推动领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在带上下文信息的多臂老虎机中，提出并分析两类算法以同时保证跨上下文的最小累计奖励与最大化总奖励；给出问题依赖的上界（对遗憾和约束违例），并给出下界，证明时间 horizon 的依赖性在一般情况下最优，揭示先前自由探索策略的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需在不同上下文之间对各臂分配收益，同时确保每个臂在所有上下文中的累计奖励达到最低阈值。跨-context 的最小奖励约束带来显著技术挑战，因为通常不存在闭式解的最优分配，且需要兼顾公平性与性能。

Method: 设计并分析两类算法：一类以乐观策略重点提升总奖励，另一类以悲观策略确保约束满足；对每种算法给出问题相关的上界，包含遗憾界限与约束违例界限，并给出一个下界，显示时序长度对结果的影响是不可回避的，揭示了自由探索原则的局限。

Result: 得到关于遗憾和约束违例的时序无关/相关的上界，以及对时序长度的下界，表明在一般情况下对 horizon 的依赖是最优的；同时揭示了在带上下文的跨-context 约束下，存在理论上的极限。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在遗憾-约束之间给出权衡，建立了带上下文的最小跨-context奖励约束的公平带学习的理论边界，明确了自由探索的局限性并为未来工作提供方向。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for privacy-preserving, low-latency ECG analysis directly at data acquisition; edge computing can reduce latency and enhance security, enabling scalable real-time monitoring.

Method: Systematic analysis of various ECG pre-processing steps to determine their suitability for edge deployment within the FACE project, using criteria of energy efficiency, processing capability, and real-time feasibility.

Result: Identification of ECG pre-processing methods that are viable for edge deployment and guidance on selecting methods based on energy, compute, and real-time criteria; insight into effective edge–cloud integration.

Conclusion: An edge-focused pre-processing strategy can satisfy privacy and real-time requirements for long-term ECG analysis and inform the design of FACE’s edge–cloud ML solution.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向，如标准化与互操作性、可解释性与透明度、可信执行环境、激励兼容机制、治理框架以及落地部署指南，以促进跨-silo FL 的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏并非主要压缩机制；其知识传递有限且高度依赖数据，常表现为负向且不对称的 transfer，更多像数据相关的正则化而非压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究知识蒸馏的功能性影响，超越仅以学生模型的准确性/损失作为压缩指标；在不改变架构前提下，量化知识蒸馏的传递机制及其跨模态、跨规模的普适性与边界，并考察安全性与鲁棒性。

Method: 通过假设检验、对照组与随机对照蒸馏等实验设计，比较多种蒸馏变体，并分析模型规模对传递效应的缩放规律；在12个实验设定、9种架构、7个数据集上进行跨模态分析。

Result: 结果显示在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识传递，但总体程度低于预期，即使在尽力最大化知识共享的条件下也如此；当存在显著传递时，通常伴随负向知识的强烈且不对称传递，带来安全性隐忧；总体上，蒸馏更像一种数据相关的正则化器，且具有负向收益，在12/9/7的广泛设置中表现为“压缩效应不足、正则化效应偏负”的模式。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不应被理解为单纯的模型压缩工具；其效应受数据分布和任务特性强烈约束，且可能产生负向的信息传递。未来需要深入揭示其机制、确定安全边界，并在设计时优先考虑作为正则化手段的潜在收益与风险。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

*Manuel Hinz,Maximilian Mauel,Patrick Seifner,David Berghaus,Kostadin Cvejoski,Ramses J. Sanchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过使用预训练的 Foundation Inference Models (FIMs) 将动力学推断与表示学习解耦；在冻结 FIM 权重的前提下仅训练编码器-解码器，实现仿真一致的损失，从而稳定潜在动力学的学习。证明概念显示在带有圆形扩散的随机双阱系统上具有快速、可重用的粗粒化潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维观测往往被低维潜在变量所主导，这些变量在低维流形上演化；同时识别粗粒化变量与拟合动力学方程是两个互相关联的问题。现有方法多将两者联合学习，可能导致不稳定或数据效率低下，因此需要解耦以提高稳健性与重用性。

Method: 利用已训练好的 Foundation Inference Models 来在零-shot 模式下估计动力学的无穷小生成子（如漂移与扩散）。通过以冻结权重的 FIM 来“摊铲”动力学推断，只训练编码器-解码器映射，并定义一个与仿真一致的简单损失，来实现稳定的表示学习。

Result: 在带半圆形扩散的随机双阱系统嵌入的合成视频数据上进行了概念验证，展示该方法在快速且可重复的粗粒化工作流中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该解耦策略可实现更稳健的潜在动力学表示学习，并为快速、可重用的粗粒化管线提供可行路径，尤其在需要利用零-shot 动力学推断的场景中具有优势。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded

TL;DR: 提出 Laminar，一个全解耦的 RL 后训练系统，解决大规模 LLM 的轨迹生成极端长尾导致的 GPU 利用率低下问题。通过引入中继工作者作为分布式参数服务实现异步、微粒度权重同步，以及动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹合并到少量滚动计算中，提升吞吐量并提升鲁棒性。评估在 1024 GPU 集群上实现高达 5.48 倍的训练吞吐量提升，并缩短模型收敛时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在面向大规模 LLM 的 RL 后训练中，轨迹生成的极端长尾分布和对齐更新的全局锁步导致 GPU 资源严重空闲，现有异步 RL 框架通过全局权重同步缓解但仍受限于固定的更新节奏。需要一种粒度更细、端到端解耦的架构以提高并行度和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出 Laminar：将全局更新替换为中继工作者组成的分布式参数服务，实现 Rollouts 可以随时拉取最新权重而不阻塞训练循环；引入动态重新打包机制，将长尾轨迹集中到少量专用滚动中以最大化生成吞吐；系统设计实现全面解耦，故障隔离，提升长期训练的鲁棒性。对 1024-GPU 集群进行评估。

Result: 在与最先进系统的比较中，Laminar 实现最高约 5.48 倍的训练吞吐量提升，同时降低模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: 完全解耦的轨迹级异步 RL 后训练系统可显著提升大规模 LLM 的训练吞吐量与鲁棒性，适用于长期大规模 RL 任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Method: 在数百万个仿真事件序列上训练一个通用的基础模型，学习事件展开的通用模式。新数据可零-shot/少-shot分析，必要时可对模型进行快速微调以提升准确性。

Result: 模型能够在不重新训练的前提下对新科学数据进行即时分析，并且通过给出少量示例即可实现微调以提高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法让复杂的事件分析更易获取，并有助于加速科学发现的步伐。

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 SG-XDEAT，一种用于表格数据的稀疏性引导的跨维度与跨编码注意力的监督学习框架。通过双流编码器（原始值流与目标条件流）及分层注意力模块实现特征间和编码间的交互，并引入自适应稀疏自注意力以抑制噪声，实验在公开基准数据集上取得相对强基线的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的监督学习往往受噪声和特征间复杂关系的影响。通过同时建模原始特征与目标条件（标签相关）表示，以及通过跨维度与跨编码的注意力机制来强化有用信号的传递，可能提高鲁棒性与性能。

Method: 设计一个双流编码器，将每个输入特征分解为原始值流和目标条件（标签相关）流；在一个多层注意力模块的分层结构中传播这两个流。核心组件包括： (i) 跨维自注意力，在每个流内捕获特征的同视角依赖； (ii) 跨编码自注意力，使原始流与目标流之间进行双向交互； (iii) 自适应稀疏自注意力（ASSA），动态将低效令牌的注意力权重收为零，降低噪声影响。

Result: 在多个公开基准数据集上与强基线相比具有一致性提升，表明同时建模原始与目标相关视图并进行噪声自适应过滤，能够得到更稳健的深度表格学习模型。

Conclusion: 通过将双视图表示与自适应稀疏注意力结合，SG-XDEAT显著提升了表格数据的监督学习性能与鲁棒性，证明了跨维度和跨编码交互在表格任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Result: On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi: Whisper-small: 35.4% parameter reduction, 14.25% lower memory, 18.5% fewer FLOPs with no WER degradation; Whisper-medium: 31% parameter reduction, 15.29% lower memory, 16.95% fewer FLOPs; also outperforms Iterative Magnitude Pruning by pruning 18.7% more parameters and reducing WER by 12.31.

Conclusion: Structured sparsity-based fine-tuning and pruning can compress Whisper for Hindi ASR while preserving accuracy, achieving competitive or superior results versus SOTA pruning methods.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of
Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on
Whisper-medium; and, (c) substantially outperform the state-of-the-art
Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along
with a 12.31 reduction in WER.

### [68] [Structure-Aware Spectral Sparsification via Uniform Edge Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12669)
*Kaiwen He,Petros Drineas,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Uniform edge sampling suffices for structure-preserving spectral clustering on graphs with strong clusterability, enabling scalable clustering without costly resistance-based sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral clustering requires eigenvector computations, which limits scalability. Classical sparsification via effective resistances preserves spectral properties but needs expensive resistance estimation. Question: can a simple, structure-agnostic uniform edge sampling achieve similar guarantees under strong clusterability?

Method: Prove that for graphs with a large structure ratio Upsilon(k)=lambda_{k+1}/rho_G(k), uniform sampling of O(gamma^2 n log n / epsilon^2) edges yields a sparsifier whose top (n-k)-dimensional eigenspace is approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. Introduce new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a rank-(n-k) effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound adapted to the dominant eigenspace; show that importance sampling is unnecessary.

Result: Uniformly sampled sparsifier preserves the target eigenspace sufficiently well to keep the spectral embedding faithful and thus preserve clustering quality; avoids expensive pre-processing for resistance estimation; provides the first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Conclusion: Under strong clusterability (large structure ratio), simple uniform edge sampling is sufficient for spectral clustering, linking coreset-based clustering theory with spectral sparsification and expanding scalable, structure-aware clustering techniques.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass

lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

TL;DR: 提出一种改进的混合思维训练策略，通过扩大数据规模、让think与no-think来源于不同问题、适度增加no-think数据，并采用两阶段训练流程，显著提升思想-无思考模式的可控性，在不牺牲准确率的前提下降低无思考输出长度与提示性词汇的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大模型在混合思维模式下的可控性与效率，使其在需要推理时能够有效切换到推理模式，而在需要直接回答时避免推理痕迹，提高运行效率与可解释性。

Method: 系统性分析影响混合思维可控性的四个关键因素，并进行实证研究：扩大数据规模、用来自不同问题的think与no-think答案、适度增加no-think数据、以及先进行推理能力训练再进行混合思维训练的两阶段策略。基于上述发现，给出一个可操作的训练方案，与标准训练相比在保持两种模式的准确性前提下显著缩短no-think输出长度和减少提示性词汇。

Result: 确定了四个最关键的影响因素并给出实证证据；提出的训练方案在两种模式下均能保持准确性，同时将no-think输出长度从1085缩短至585，并将如wait等推理辅助性词汇的出现次数从5917降至522（以MATH500数据集为例）。

Conclusion: 当前的混合思维方法在可控性方面仍存在局限，本文给出的一组可操作改进策略能够显著提升模式切换的可控性与效率，未来需要进一步优化数据构建和训练流程以实现更强的模式隔离与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Motivation: 在城际客运中，GPS轨迹稀疏且标注数据匮乏，影响异常停车检测的效果。现有方法往往假设密集采样或规律移动，适用性差。需要通过自适应分段、领域指标和半监督学习来缓解稀疏性与标签缺乏的问题。

Conclusion: 提出了一整合稀疏感知分段、图-半监督学习与自训练的框架，有效提升在数据稀疏场景下的异常停车检测性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上通过实验验证了 DiffEM 的有效性，显示所提出的方法能够从受损数据训练出有用的扩散模型并提升重建效果。

Conclusion: DiffEM 为从受损数据训练扩散模型提供了一条新路径，具有理论收敛性，扩展了扩散模型在逆问题中的应用范围。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: Multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural networks (KERMT, KGPT) yields superior drug-property predictions over non-pretrained models, with larger gains at bigger data sizes; the work also publishes multitask ADMET splits and provides an accelerated GitHub implementation for large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical pretrained models capture general chemical knowledge from self-supervised training, which can improve predictions of drug discovery endpoints (potency, ADMET). Multitask learning during finetuning may enhance performance and generalization beyond single-task fine-tuning.

Method: Fine-tuning chemical pretrained GNNs (KERMT, an enhanced GROVER) and KGPT with multitask objectives; comparison against non-pretrained GNNs; evaluation across data sizes to assess data-efficiency; release of multitask ADMET data splits; provision of accelerated KERMT implementation for scalable pretraining/finetuning/inference.

Result: Multitask finetuning significantly improves predictive performance over non-pretrained GNNs, with the largest gains observed at larger dataset sizes; multitask ADMET splits enable more robust benchmarking; accelerated implementation on GitHub facilitates industrial-scale workflows.

Conclusion: Multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained GNNs is a promising approach to boost drug-property predictions, particularly in data-rich regimes, and the provided benchmarks and software support will aid adoption in industrial drug discovery.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

*Dayin Gou,Sanghyun Byun,Nilesh Malpeddi,Gabrielle De Micheli,Prathamesh Vaste,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ is a post-training compression method that combines a Corrective Adaptor with group Residual Vector Quantization to compress embedding layers to about 1.6 bits per parameter, enabling 4-bit memory usage on edge devices while maintaining performance close to scalar quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have very large embedding layers that impose substantial memory and bandwidth requirements, especially on edge devices. Reducing the embedding memory footprint can speed up inference and enable deployment in memory-constrained environments without requiring specialized hardware.

Method: Introduces CARVQ, a post-training compression technique that combines a Corrective Adaptor (CA) with Group Residual Vector Quantization (GRVQ). The approach uses a mix of linear and non-linear mappings to mimic the original embedding, enabling compression to around 1.6 bits per parameter. It is designed to be compatible with existing transformer quantization methods and can operate on hardware supporting 4-bit memory, without requiring hardware changes.

Result: Empirically tested on multiple pre-trained LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2-1B/3B/3B-Instruct/3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B/Math-7B, Phi-4) across diverse tasks (generative, discriminative, math, reasoning). CARVQ achieves lower average bitwidth per parameter than scalar quantization while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy, demonstrating effective memory footprint reduction with compatible performance.

Conclusion: CARVQ offers a novel, post-training compression technique that integrates with state-of-the-art transformer quantization to reduce embedding memory usage to 4-bit hardware, enabling efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices without significant loss in performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Result: NP-hardness in general; hardness persists for small d or small D individually; combined small D and d yields FPT; implementation demonstrates practicality and empirical performance.

Conclusion: Combined parameterization by D and d yields tractable solutions for these local-search variants, bridging theory and practice in decision-tree learning.

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

*Jon Donnelly,Srikar Katta,Emanuele Borgonovo,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 UNIVERSE：通过 Rashomon 集来对 VI 进行鲁棒估计，即便存在不可观测特征缺失，给出 VI 的界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标准 VI 流程中，VI 对模型和特征集敏感，Rashomon 效应导致不同近似最优模型给出不同的特征重要性；现实数据常有缺失的关键变量。

Method: 将 Rashomon 集合概念用于变量重要性估计，通过在近似最优模型集合上界定 VI，考虑不可观测特征，理论保证鲁棒性，并在半合成数据与信用风险任务中评估。

Result: 理论上给出对 VI 的界限，表现出对缺失特征鲁棒性与强健性，在半合成仿真和信用风险任务中获得良好表现。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE 可在存在缺失特征的情况下，提供对真实 VI 的界限并具备鲁棒性，展示了在现实数据集上的应用潜力。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

TL;DR: 在多决策者情境下设计单一预测器以同时最小化多种损失的 omniprediction 问题，比较提升法与对抗博弈法的优缺点，给出下界并提出更直接的未随机化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下游决策者使用预测信息来指引行动，预测器需要对多种损失同时表现良好，因此需要设计能够兼顾多目标的单一预测器。

Method: 分析现有两大类 omniprediction 方法：一类是通过提升方法优化诸如多校准之类的辅助目标，从而间接获得 omniprediction；另一类是基于对抗博弈的在线方法，估计并对抗最坏损失。文中给出下界，表明多校准比 omniprediction 更难，需要更大的样本复杂度；对抗博弈可通过在线到离线转换获得样本高效的算法，但代价是返回一个复杂的随机化预测器。作者进一步提出一种更直接、未随机化的算法，利用正损失集合的结构来提高效率。

Result: 下界显示多校准任务的困难性高于 omniprediction，从而导致提升路线的样本复杂度更高；在线到离线的转换提供了一种样本高效路径，但结果为随机化预测器且实现复杂；所提的直接未随机化算法利用正损失的结构，使得在保持多目标适应性的同时提高实现和样本效率。

Conclusion: 揭示了两大主流方法在 omniprediction 的权衡：提升类方法在样本要求上可能受限，而对抗博弈法虽然有样本优势但返回复杂的随机化预测器。文中还给出一种直接的未随机化算法，利用损失的结构性特征以提升实际可用性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

TL;DR: 在量子博弈中建立欺骗框架，将 Honey-X 从经典零和扩展到量子域；将欺骗视为对收益哈密顿量的受控扰动，受欺骗预算约束；若受害者知情，均衡策略与天真受害者等价，进而可将问题视作双层优化并重构为双线性半正定规划；通过量子版 Penny Flip 游戏的仿真，量子策略空间和非经典收益放大欺骗效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补量子博弈领域中对欺骗行为的理论建模，借鉴经典 Honey-X 框架，探讨在量子信息约束下欺骗如何影响玩家均衡，以及是否可通过优化手段求解。

Method: 将欺骗建模为受控扰动：对收益哈密顿量施加带有预算约束的扰动；分析在被害者具备欺骗可视信息时的均衡性质；将问题表述为双层优化并转化为双线性半正定规划（BD-SDP）；通过量子版 Penny Flip 等游戏的仿真来演示框架。

Result: 理论结果表明，当受害者意识到可能的欺骗时，其均衡策略与完全信任欺骗的天真受害者一致；给出可计算的BD-SDP重构形式；仿真实验显示量子策略空间和非经典的支付结构放大了欺骗的影响相较经典情形。

Conclusion: 该框架为量子博弈中的欺骗提供理论与计算工具，揭示量子优势在欺骗情境中的作用，并为量子博弈理论和应用的设计与分析提供新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for deception in quantum games,
extending the Honey-X paradigm from classical zero-sum settings into the
quantum domain. Building on a view of deception in classical games as
manipulation of a player's perception of the payoff matrix, we formalize
quantum deception as controlled perturbations of the payoff Hamiltonian subject
to a deception budget. We show that when victims are aware of possible
deception, their equilibrium strategies surprisingly coincide with those of
naive victims who fully trust the deceptive Hamiltonian. This equivalence
allows us to cast quantum deception as a bilevel optimization problem, which
can be reformulated into a bilinear semidefinite program. To illustrate the
framework, we present simulations on quantum versions of the Penny Flip game,
demonstrating how quantum strategy spaces and non-classical payoffs can amplify
the impact of deception relative to classical formulations.

Abstract: The most startling of the contemporary problems is the sleepiness of
chauffeur which causes lots of car accidents. Prevention of those impending
accidents by detecting and alerting the sleepy chauffeur is vital, otherwise
that would lead to loss of lives and various traumas along with severe
injuries. The slumber or sleep may be caused by huge stress, pressure,
relentless work load or alcoholism, for which sleep deprivation occurs and the
chauffeur while driving gets drowsy. So far, considerable amount of systems has
been developed to detect drowsiness of drivers, most of which mainly depend on
image processing algorithms using cameras. Some of them also incorporate
artificial intelligence and machine learning based algorithms. This paper
presents a review of the existing systems and also proposes an easy and cheap
system using sensors and Arduino, capable of detecting sleepiness and generates
siren alarm and send alert message to take precautionary measures.

Conclusion: 基于概率的本地市场框架具有扩大可再生渗透、改善配电网运行与市场效率的潜力，可作为未来市场设计的研究与试点方向。

Abstract: Since the 1990s, widespread introduction of central (wholesale) electricity
markets has been seen across multiple continents, driven by the search for
efficient operation of the power grid through competition. The increase of
renewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and
distribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to
the latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and
disadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon
emissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring
flexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers
or smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of
large-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity
markets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not
account for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we
propose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational
marginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production,
consumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid
using the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty
using general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in
the day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for
every timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot)
prices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a
trivial calculation reveals the real-time price. Through four instructive
case-studies we highlight the effectiveness of the method to incentivize
end-prosumers' participation in the market, while ensuring that their behavior
does not have an adverse impact on the operation of the grid.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种非参数的频域辨识方法，利用并网变流器实现对 dq-不对称网格阻抗的超快识别，覆盖宽频带，测量时间<1s；无需专用激励信号或硬件，且对网格结构无先验假设；用详细电磁暂态仿真验证并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辨识方法各有权衡：被动方法依赖环境谐波与罕见的网格事件，频率信息有限；主动时域方法通常需较长时间序列和专用设备；某些时域主动方法虽然时间更短，但常有粗略简化假设或需要繁琐的模型阶次整定。需要一种无专用激励、能在极短时间内、非参数、对网格结构无假设的辨识方法。

Method: 提出一种非参数的频域辨识方法，在不依赖特定激励信号或硬件的前提下，利用并网变流器的观测数据对 dq-方向的小信号不对称阻抗进行宽带域识别，方法在频域直接提取阻抗谱，避免繁杂的模型参数化与阶次选取。

Result: 通过详细的电磁暂态仿真对方法进行验证，结果显示该方法在识别速度和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方案，能够实现超快速识别并覆盖广泛频率范围。

Conclusion: 所提出的非参数频域辨识方法不依赖专用激励或硬件、对网格结构无假设、识别时间极短且覆盖宽频带，在仿真验证中表现出对现有方法的明显优势。

Abstract: We propose a non-parametric frequency-domain method to identify small-signal
$dq$-asymmetric grid impedances, over a wide frequency band, using
grid-connected converters. Existing identification methods are faced with
significant trade-offs: e.g., passive approaches rely on ambient harmonics and
rare grid events and thus can only provide estimates at a few frequencies,
while many active approaches that intentionally perturb grid operation require
long time series measurement and specialized equipment. Although active
time-domain methods reduce the measurement time, they either make crude
simplifying assumptions or require laborious model order tuning. Our approach
effectively addresses these challenges: it does not require specialized
excitation signals or hardware and achieves ultrafast ($<1$ s) identification,
drastically reducing measurement time. Being non-parametric, our approach also
makes no assumptions on the grid structure. A detailed electromagnetic
transient simulation is used to validate the method and demonstrate its clear
superiority over existing alternatives.

Result: 通过仿真显示6-DOF跟踪精度，验证UC-FAS框架在实现稳定跟踪中的有效性。

Conclusion: 为非线性四旋翼控制提供了标准化范式，桥接理论FAS进展与实际实现需求。

Abstract: This paper proposes a unidirectionally connected fully actuated system
(UC-FAS) approach for the sub-stabilization and tracking control of 6-DOF
quadrotors, tackling limitations both in state-space and FAS framework to some
extent. The framework systematically converts underactuated quadrotor dynamics
into a UC-FAS model, unifying the existing different FAS transformation ways.
By eliminating estimation of the high-order derivatives of control inputs, a
drawback of current methods, the UC-FAS model simplifies controller design and
enables direct eigenstructure assignment for closed-loop dynamics. Simulations
demonstrate precise 6-DOF tracking performance. This work bridges theoretical
FAS approach advancements with practical implementation needs, offering a
standardized paradigm for nonlinear quadrotor control.

Abstract: Wind power producers can benefit from forming coalitions to participate
cooperatively in electricity markets. To support such collaboration, various
profit allocation rules rooted in cooperative game theory have been proposed.
However, existing approaches overlook the lack of coherence among producers
regarding forecast information, which may lead to ambiguity in offering and
allocations. In this paper, we introduce a ``reconcile-then-optimize''
framework for cooperative market offerings. This framework first aligns the
individual forecasts into a coherent joint forecast before determining market
offers. With such forecasts, we formulate and solve a two-stage stochastic
programming problem to derive both the aggregate offer and the corresponding
scenario-based dual values for each trading hour. Based on these dual values,
we construct a profit allocation rule that is budget-balanced and stable.
Finally, we validate the proposed method through empirical case studies,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and theoretical soundness.

Motivation: 在农村无源电力约束/能源受限的场景下，利用低时延且高可靠的NR NR Sidelink V2X以提升碰撞避免的安全性，同时需要兼顾能源效率以延长设备运行时间。

Result: 在重交通中，增大Pt并在SCS=30kHz下选用低阶MCS可在D_comm距离内维持高PRR，尽管Energy成本较高；在轻交通中，使用较低Pt且低MCS可实现更优的能效与可靠性折中，同时保持在D_comm处的可接受PRR。

Conclusion: 需要一个自适应、能源感知的策略来在农村V2X中同时保障安全性与能效。

Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links,
especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side
units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must
be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication
control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and
coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be
configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural line-of-sight
(LOS) scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by
the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication
distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels
during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy
traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at
$\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$,
albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower
$P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable
reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at
$D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive,
energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural
V2X systems.

Motivation: 在保护敏感观测信息的前提下进行分布式参数估计，同时降低通信开销。传统方法在隐私保护与通信成本之间常常存在折衷，本文提出以二值量化实现隐私保护并降低通信量，同时确保估计收敛。

Method: 引入二值量化的隐私保护分布式估计算法，更新过程中引入时间变化的隐私噪声与自适应/时间变步长设计，使输出信号对敏感信息的Fisher信息随时间以多项式速率收敛到零；每个传感器在每时步只发送1比特到邻居，无需假设对实值消息量化误差可以忽略。通过理论推导给出收敛性和隐私性分析，并给出隐私噪声与步长的联合设计准则，辅以数值验证。

Conclusion: 提出一个隐私保护与通信成本耦合的协同设计框架，通过对隐私噪声和步长的合适设计，能够在保护敏感信息的同时实现对未知参数的几乎必然收敛，并给出隐私-收敛速率的定量关系，具有理论与数值双重支持。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem
with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information.
Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed
estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's
privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication
costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher
information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher
information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive
information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in
privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a
multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits
only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally,
the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is
not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and
reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge
almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a
co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A
polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off
between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples
demonstrate the main results.

Abstract: In the transition toward a sustainable power system, renewable-based Virtual
Power Plants (RVPPs) have emerged as a promising solution to the challenges of
integrating renewable energy sources into electricity markets. Their viability,
however, depends on effective market participation strategies and the ability
to manage uncertainties while leveraging flexible resources. This paper
analyzes the impact of different flexible resources - such as concentrated
solar power plants, hydro plants, biomass plants, and flexible demand - on the
participation of RVPPs in energy and reserve markets. Multiple sources of
uncertainty in generation, consumption, and electricity prices are addressed

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种利用PN结前向V-I特性在模拟硬件中实现近端算子，以近似实现对l1与MCP正则化的稀疏重构，并通过近端梯度法在压缩感知框架中验证其性能，且考虑了模拟器件噪声的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在硬件层面实现高效、低功耗的模拟压缩感知稀疏重构，需将近端算子进行可行的模拟近似，以减少计算资源与功耗。

Abstract: In order to realize analog compressed sensing, the paper considers
approximate proximal operators of the $\ell_1$ and minimax concave penalty
(MCP) regularization functions. Specifically, we propose to realize the
approximate functions by an electric analog circuit using forward
voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of the PN-junction diodes. To confirm the
validity of the proposed approach, we employ the proposed approximate proximal
operators for the $\ell_1$ and MCP regularization functions in compressed
sensing with the proximal gradient method. The sparse reconstruction
performance of the algorithms using the proposed approximate proximal operators
is demonstrated via computer simulations taking into account the impact of
additive noise introduced by analog devices.

*Zahra Mobini,Hien Quoc Ngo,Ardavan Rahimian,Anvar Tukmanov,David Townend,Michail Matthaiou,Simon L. Cotton*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A hybrid centralized-distributed precoding framework for fronthaul-limited CF-mMIMO, selecting groups of users for centralized vs. distributed precoding and optimizing power, to maximize sum spectral efficiency under fronthaul and per-AP constraints; shows superior performance over fully centralized or distributed schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fronthaul-limited cell-free mMIMO systems, there is a need to balance performance and fronthaul usage. A hybrid approach that dynamically adapts processing at the CPU and APs can better accommodate varying fronthaul capacity and spectral efficiency requirements.

Method: Divide users into two groups: one served by centralized precoding at a central unit and the other by distributed precoding at local APs. Formulate a joint optimization problem for user grouping and power control to maximize the sum SE subject to fronthaul and per-AP power constraints. Transform the problem into a tractable form and develop efficient algorithms to solve it.

Result: Numerical results show the hybrid scheme delivers versatile and superior performance, consistently outperforming fully centralized and fully distributed approaches across different system configurations.

Conclusion: Hybrid centralized-distributed precoding provides a flexible mechanism to adapt to fronthaul constraints while achieving high spectral efficiency, outperforming traditional single-mode processing in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate a fronthaul-limited cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system and propose a hybrid centralized-distributed
precoding strategy that dynamically adapts to varying fronthaul and spectral
efficiency (SE) requirements. The proposed approach divides users into two
groups: one served by centralized precoding and the other by distributed
precoding. We formulate a novel optimization problem for user grouping and
power control aimed at maximizing the sum SE, subject to fronthaul and
per-access point (AP) power constraints. To tackle the problem, we transform it
into a tractable form and propose efficient solution algorithms. Numerical
results confirm the hybrid scheme's versatility and superior performance,
consistently outperforming fully centralized and distributed approaches across
diverse system configurations.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 在加性均匀噪声信道的峰值约束和成本约束下，成本函数凹时最优输入分布离散；成本函数凸且约束活跃时，最优分布覆盖整个区间；离散情形给出容量的解析表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在不同成本函数形状下，输入分布的离散性如何影响容量，以及在有峰值与成本约束的情况下何时量化是最优的。

Method: 对加性均匀噪声信道进行解析推导，给出容量达到时的输入分布作为噪声水平、平均成本约束和成本函数曲率的函数；区分成本凹性与凸性的情形；在离散容量实现的情况下导出容量的解析表达式。

Result: 若成本函数为凹，则容量实现的输入分布为离散；若成本函数为凸且成本约束处于活跃状态，则最优输入分布的支持覆盖整个区间；对于离散容量实现，给出信道容量的解析表达式。

Conclusion: 成本函数的曲率决定最佳输入分布的离散性与连续性；在离散情形下可获得解析的容量表达式。

Abstract: Under which condition is quantization optimal? We address this question in
the context of the additive uniform noise channel under peak amplitude and cost
constraints. We compute analytically the capacity-achieving input distribution
as a function of the noise level, the average cost constraint, and the
curvature of the cost function. We find that when the cost function is concave,
the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete, whereas when the cost
function is convex and the cost constraint is active, the support of the
capacity-achieving input distribution spans the entire interval. For the cases
of a discrete capacity-achieving input distribution, we derive the analytical
expressions for the capacity of the channel.

Conclusion: 该闭式模型为O波段相干传输的系统优化提供了一种高效且准确的工具，超越传统GN模型在低色散情形下的局限性。

Abstract: We present a novel closed-form model for nonlinear interference (NLI)

incorporates the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency term as well as the coherent
contributions of self- and cross-phase modulation (SPM/XPM) across multiple
identical spans. This extension enables accurate evaluation of the NLI in

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the viability of ML-integrated channel estimation for improving spectral efficiency and resource allocation in next-generation networks; calls for more real-world datasets and hybrid architectures to enhance generalization.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-assisted channel estimation approach

### [94] [Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architecture Design and Optimization under Physics-Consistent Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12366)
*Zheyu Wu,Matteo Nerini,Bruno Clerckx*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: BD-RIS extends conventional RIS by allowing inter-element connections beyond diagonal, achieving flexible channel shaping under a physics-consistent multiport model. Band-connected RIS matches fully-connected RIS in channel-shaping capability; advanced optimization methods (SDR for SISO/MIMO, ADMM for multiuser MIMO) are developed and validated against practical EM effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RIS uses a diagonal scattering matrix, limiting flexibility. BD-RIS offers greater design freedom but most models ignore EM effects like mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. A physics-consistent, multiport-network-based model is needed to accurately analyze and optimize BD-RIS performance.

Method: Adopt the compact reformulation of the physics-consistent multiport network model. Prove band-connected BD-RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected BD-RIS. Develop optimization algorithms: (1) closed-form solutions for SISO; (2) globally optimal SDR-based algorithm for single-stream MIMO; (3) ADMM-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO.

Result: Comprehensive simulations quantify the impact of EM effects (mutual coupling, unilateral approximation) on performance. Findings show band-connected BD-RIS attains the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected BD-RIS under the physics-consistent model, and the proposed algorithms effectively optimize BD-RIS under practical conditions; EM effects significantly influence performance, underscoring the need for accurate modeling.

Conclusion: BD-RIS with a physics-consistent multiport model is a viable and advantageous extension over conventional RIS. Band-connected architectures suffice for channel shaping, simplifying hardware design without sacrificing performance. The developed SISO/SISO-MIMO/ multiuser-MIMO optimization algorithms enable practical deployment, while explicit consideration of EM effects is crucial for accurate performance prediction.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future
wireless communication systems. Conventional RIS is constrained to a diagonal
scattering matrix, which limits its flexibility. Recently, beyond-diagonal RIS
(BD-RIS) has been proposed as a more general RIS architecture class that allows
inter-element connections and shows great potential for performance
improvement. Despite extensive progress on BD-RIS, most existing studies rely
on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic (EM) effects
such as mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. To address this gap, this
paper investigates the architecture design and optimization of BD-RIS under the
general physics-consistent model derived with multiport network theory in
recent literature. Building on a compact reformulation of this model, we show
that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as
fully-connected RIS, which extends existing results obtained for conventional
channel models. We then develop optimization methods under the general
physics-consistent model; specifically, we derive closed-form solutions for
single-input single-output (SISO) systems, propose a globally optimal
semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for single-stream multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems, and design an efficient alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems. Using
the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the
impact of various EM effects and approximations, including mutual coupling
among RIS antennas and the commonly adopted unilateral approximation, on system
performance.

*Zhen Du,Jingjing Xu,Yifeng Xiong,Jie Wang,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Fan Liu,Shi Jin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 在6G ISAC 场景中，提出统一的概率星座整形（PCS）框架，通过最大化通信速率并以感知CSI的MSE、功率与概率分布约束为指标，在匹配/错配滤波下实现感知与通信的可控权衡，同时保持调制信号的随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限字母调制（如QAM）导致感知性能在匹配/错配滤波下显著恶化；需要在不显著削弱通信随机性的前提下提升感知能力。

Method: 提出PCS框架，兼容匹配/错配滤波，通过优化发送符号分布来最大化通信速率，同时对 sensing CSI 的MSE、总功率、以及概率分布进行约束；将MSE用作感知CSI的核心指标，并分析MSE、SNRout、ISLR之间的关系；通过仿真与现场测量验证。

Result: PCS实现了灵活的感知-通信权衡，显著提升感知能力且保持符号随机性；在仿真和实测中验证其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PCS提供一个可用于6G ISAC的实用框架，MSE基感知指标比仅看SNRout/ISLR更全面，且能在真实场景中提升系统性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered an innovative
technology in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, where utilizing
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals for
sensing provides a cost-effective solution for implementing ISAC. However, the
sensing performance of matched and mismatched filtering schemes can be
significantly deteriorated due to the signaling randomness induced by
finite-alphabet modulations with nonconstant modulus, such as quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Therefore, improving sensing
performance without significantly compromising communication capability (i.e.,
maintaining randomness), remains a challenging task. To that end, we propose a
unified probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) framework that is compatible
with both matched and mismatched filtering schemes, by maximizing the
communication rate while imposing constraints on mean square error (MSE) of
sensing channel state information (CSI), power, and probability distribution.
Specifically, the MSE of sensing CSI is leveraged to optimize sensing
capability, which is illustrated to be a more comprehensive metric compared to
the output SNR after filtering (SNRout) and integrated sidelobes ratio (ISLR).
Additionally, the internal relationships among these three sensing metrics are
explicitly analyzed. Finally, both simulations and field measurements validate
the efficiency of proposed PCS approach in achieving a flexible S&C trade-off,
as well as its credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 从链路级到场景级的视角转变揭示：链路级标准化信道模型（如3GPP TDL/CDL）在评估ML物理层方法时带来分布偏移和近似高斯性的问题，导致ML模型与传统方法并无显著优势；在场景级视角下，线性方法在信道压缩、估计和建模等任务上表现最佳，且可释放ML潜在收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的链路级信道模型被广泛用于评估ML-based物理层方法，但它们把复杂的多样性简化为固定的分布和近似高斯性，可能导致分布转移和在线训练的现实挑战，进而错估ML的实际效用。

Method: 对比分析链路级（如TDL/CDL）与场景级信道描述，理论论证与/或实验验证ML模型在链路级数据上不优于经典线性方法，提出在场景级视角下对信道压缩、估计和建模任务进行评估的框架。

Result: 结果显示：在链路级信道数据上，ML模型并未超越简单线性方法，甚至在多种物理层应用中表现不佳；线性方法在信道压缩、估计和建模方面达到最优。

Conclusion: 建议将评估焦点从链路级转向场景级，以解锁ML在物理层的相对增益，避免受限于链路级假设带来的分布偏移与近似高斯性问题。

Abstract: Standardized (link-level) channel models such as the 3GPP TDL and CDL models
are frequently used to evaluate machine learning (ML)-based physical-layer
methods. However, in this work, we argue that a link-level perspective
incorporates limiting assumptions, causing unwanted distributional shifts or
necessitating impractical online training. An additional drawback is that this
perspective leads to (near-)Gaussian channel characteristics. Thus, ML-based
models, trained on link-level channel data, do not outperform classical
approaches for a variety of physical-layer applications. Particularly, we
demonstrate the optimality of simple linear methods for channel compression,
estimation, and modeling, revealing the unsuitability of link-level channel
models for evaluating ML models. On the upside, adopting a scenario-level
perspective offers a solution to this problem and unlocks the relative gains
enabled by ML.

TL;DR: 提出若干新颖的 Circulant Hadamard 矩阵构造及其在 CZCS、GCS、CCC、CZCSS 等编码集合中的扩展，覆盖所有长度与阶次，并给出与 Hadamard 猜想相关的新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hadamard 矩阵及其在信号处理、编码理论中的核心作用促使寻找广泛适用且计算可行的构造。Circulant Hadamard 矩阵的稀缺性（仅有有限阶的已知实例）以及需要覆盖所有长度的需求，驱动研究者开发新的代数工具和组合构造，以获得对 GCS、CZCS、CCC、CZCSS 等对象的统一构造框架及其参数灵活性。

Method: 基于线性算子和广义布尔函数（GBF）构造了阶4的 8 个 circulant Hadamard 矩阵；将其递归应用以获得覆盖所有长度且相位为偶的二进制 CZCS、以及所有长度的二进制 GCS 和阶为 2^{n+2} 的 Hadamard 矩阵（n≥1）。提出一种低复杂度的替代构造，利用循环矩阵构造所有长度的二进制 GCS 和阶为 2^{a+1}10^b26^c 的 Hadamard 矩阵（a,b,c≥0），并实现了柔性的 flock 尺度。进一步将 GCS 的构造扩展为参数为 (2N,2N,2N)-CCC（N=2^a10^b26^c）的二进制 CCC，同时扩展 CZCS 构造得到参数为 (2^{n+2},2^{n+2},2^{n+2},2^{n+1})-CZCSS 的二进制最优集合。论文还给出 Hadamard 矩阵与 GCS 之间的关系，以及用于证明定理的 circulant 矩阵在 ACCF/AACF 下的若干性质。

Result: 证明并给出阶为 4 的 circulant Hadamard 的全部 8 个实例的新的构造方法；给出覆盖所有长度、相位为偶的 CZCS、以及所有长度的 GCS 的构造，及阶为 2^{n+2} 的 Hadamard 矩阵；给出阶为 2^{a+1}10^b26^c 的低复杂度 Hadamard/GCS 构造及其圆矩阵实现，且具有灵活的 flock 尺度；将 GCS 构造扩展为二进制 CCC(2N,2N,2N) 并可覆盖 N=2^a10^b26^c；扩展 CZCS 构造得到最优 CZCSS；提出 Hadamard 与 GCS 的新联系以为 Hadamard 猜想提供新研究方向；并给出关于圆矩阵在 ACCF/AACF 下的若干性质，作为证明基础。

Conclusion: 所提出的构造均为新颖，且参数设置与现有成果相比具有更广的覆盖性与灵活性（如可控 flock 尺度、覆盖所有长度等），并为 Hadamard 猜想的研究提供新方向。还实现了 CZCS、GCS、CCC、CZCSS 的统一或并行扩展，提升了对循环矩阵及其相关跨相关/自相关性质的理解，具有潜在的理论意义和应用价值。

Abstract: A Hadamard matrix $H$ is a square matrix of order $n$ with entries $\pm 1$,
such that $HH^\top=nI_{n}$, where $I_n$ is an identity matrix of order $n$. A
circulant Hadamard matrix $H$ is a Hadamard matrix that has rows of entries in
cyclic order. There exist only $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices of order 4, and
here, we provide a novel construction of all such $8$ circulant Hadamard
matrices using a linear operator and generalized Boolean function (GBF). The
constructed circulant Hadamard matrices are used recursively to construct a
binary cross Z-complementary set (CZCS) of all lengths with an even phase, a
binary Golay complementary set (GCS) of all lengths, and Hadamard matrices of
order $2^{n+2}$, where $n\geq1$. The construction of a binary CZCS covering all
lengths was not available before. We also propose an alternative,
lower-complexity construction of binary GCSs of all lengths and Hadamard
matrices of order $2^{a+1}10^b26^c$ using circulant matrices, where $ a,b,c
\geq 0$. The proposed binary GCS covers all lengths with a flexible flock size.
The constructions of GCS are further extended to form binary complete
complementary code (CCC) of the parameter $(2N,2N,2N)-CCC$ where
$N=2^a10^b26^c, a,b,c \geq 0$. The constructed binary CCC provides a flexible
flock size. The construction of CZCS is further extended to form a binary
optimal cross-Z complementary sequence set (CZCSS) of the parameter $(2^{n+2},
2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+1})-CZCSS$, where $n\geq1$. Finally, we provide a
relation between Hadamard matrices and GCS, which enables the study of the
Hadamard conjecture in a new direction. We also provided a few properties of
circulant matrices over aperiodic cross-correlation (ACCF) and aperiodic
auto-correlation (AACF), which are used to prove the theorems. All proposed
constructions are novel, and their parameters are compared with the existing
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential technique for neuroscience
research and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recently, large-scale
EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of
EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also
poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this
paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to
support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and
electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding
to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified
representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed
by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures
spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of
HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data
collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes.
Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing
EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing
across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.

Conclusion: 跨域波形处理具有重要潜力；所提出的自适应变换域框架为面向未来的无线系统提供灵活的信道建模、特征提取和波形设计手段。未来方向包括高效实现域切换、降低复杂度、标准化接口以及在现实场景中的验证等。

Abstract: The emergence of alternative multiplexing domains to the time-frequency
domains, e.g., the delay-Doppler and chirp domains, offers a promising approach
for addressing the challenges posed by complex propagation environments and
next-generation applications. Unlike the time and frequency domains, these
domains offer unique channel representations which provide additional degrees
of freedom (DoF) for modeling, characterizing, and exploiting wireless channel
features. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of channel
characteristics, including delay, Doppler shifts, and channel coefficients
across various domains, with an emphasis on their inter-domain relationships,
shared characteristics, and domain-specific distinctions. We further evaluate
the comparative advantages of each domain under specific channel conditions.
Building on this analysis, we propose a generalized and adaptive transform
domain framework that leverages the pre- and post-processing of the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, to enable dynamic transitions between various
domains in response to the channel conditions and system requirements. Finally,
several representative use cases are presented to demonstrate the applicability
of the proposed cross-domain waveform processing framework in diverse
scenarios, along with future directions and challenges.

*Axel Janson,Joakim Andén*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出将扩散模型作为数据驱动先验的贝叶斯多参考对齐框架，在低信噪比下显著提升样本效率并提供不确定性量化，适用于包括 cryo-EM 在内的轨道恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在强噪声和随机平移下的信号恢复对样本数量的高度依赖性问题；通过引入可学习的先验以降低所需样本量，同时提供不确定性评估。

Method: 在样本功率谱（一个不变统计量）的条件下，使用扩散模型作为 plug-and-play 先验，结合贝叶斯后验采样实现对齐问题的概率推断与不确定性量化；与传统的 EM、bispectrum inversion 等方法进行对比。

Result: 仿真实验表明，在相同或更低样本量下，该方法实现更准确的信号重建并提供可信区间/不确定性评估，相比现有方法表现出更好的样本效率与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将扩散模型引入多参考对齐任务，为其他轨道恢复问题（如 cryo-EM）提供一个有前景的框架，强调先验在降低样本需求、提升不确定性量化中的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of multi-reference alignment --
the recovery of signals from noisy, randomly shifted observations. While
existing frequentist methods accurately recover the signal at arbitrarily low
signal-to-noise ratios, they require a large number of samples to do so. In
contrast, our proposed method leverages diffusion models as data-driven
plug-and-play priors, conditioning these on the sample power spectrum (a
shift-invariant statistic) enabling both accurate posterior sampling and
uncertainty quantification. The use of an appropriate prior significantly
reduces the required number of samples, as illustrated in simulation
experiments with comparisons to state-of-the-art methods such as
expectation--maximization and bispectrum inversion. These findings establish
our approach as a promising framework for other orbit recovery problems, such
as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

### [101] [Enhanced Angle-Range Cluster Parameter Estimation in Full-Duplex ISAC Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12711)
*Muhammad Talha,Besma Smida,David González G*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种面向ISAC的TMS算法，针对角-距分布的目标簇进行参数估计；结合基于DFT的距离与距离扩展估计，并设计动态波束形成以同时服务DL用户，实验结果在不同SNR和大角度扩展下优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在目标在角度与距离域上呈簇集分布的场景下，传统MUSIC扩展（CMS）难以自适应选择子空间秩，导致对密度函数参数估计与多目标/多用户场景的性能受限。ISAC系统需要联合高效的参数估计与波束赋形以提升感知与通信性能。

Method: 将每个目标建模为由密度函数参数化的射线簇。提出截断MUSIC扩展（TMS），根据接收信号自相关的特征分解自适应约束信号子空间秩。提出基于离散傅里叶变换（DFT）的算法估计距离与距离扩展。基于上述估计，设计动态发射波束形成算法，能够同时照亮多个目标并为下行用户服务。

Result: 通过仿真在低/高信噪比及宽角扩展等场景下，所提算法相较基线方案具有更优的参数估计与波束控制性能，显示出在ISAC任务中的鲁棒性与有效性。

Conclusion: TMS结合DFT距离/扩展估计与动态波束形成，提升对角-距分布目标的参数估计与多目标多用户场景下的ISAC性能，在不同SNR与大角度扩展条件下均展现优势。

Abstract: This work studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework
for targets that are spread both in the angle and range domains. We model each
target using a cluster of rays parameterized by a specific density function,
and propose a truncated Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) spread (TMS)
algorithm to accurately estimate the parameters of the density function. Unlike
the conventional MUSIC spread (CMS), TMS restricts the signal subspace rank
based on the eigen decomposition of the received-signal autocorrelation. We
also propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithm for estimating
the distance and range spread of each target. Leveraging these estimates, we
then develop a dynamic transmit beamforming algorithm that successfully
illuminates multiple targets while also serving multiple downlink (DL) users.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over
baseline schemes in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes as
well as under a wide angular spread regime.

### [102] [A Comprehensive Survey of Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses in Tor: Advances and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11804)
*Yuwen Cui,Guangjing Wang,Khanh Vu,Kai Wei,Kehan Shen,Zhengyuan Jiang,Xiao Han,Ning Wang,Zhuo Lu,Yao Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 对 Tor 领域网站指纹识别（WF）的系统性综述，按数据集、攻击模型和防御机制三大维度整理现有工作，比较其优劣并提出未来挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WF攻击对隐私造成严重威胁，需要统一的研究综述来梳理数据集、方法和防御，推动更强的隐私保护。

Method: 系统性分类与对比分析：梳理数据集、攻击模型、与防御机制，评估在不同威胁模型下的性能、可用性和系统开销。

Result: 整合并对比现有工作，揭示优点与局限，指出未来研究方向和新兴挑战（如多标签浏览、粗粒度特征），为改进 Tor 的隐私保护提供基础。

Conclusion: 通过统一的框架，促进 WF 研究的协同进展，并为实现更强的隐私保护提供研究路线图。

Abstract: The Tor network provides users with strong anonymity by routing their
internet traffic through multiple relays. While Tor encrypts traffic and hides
IP addresses, it remains vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks such as the
website fingerprinting (WF) attack, achieving increasingly high fingerprinting
accuracy even under open-world conditions. In response, researchers have
proposed a variety of defenses, ranging from adaptive padding, traffic
regularization, and traffic morphing to adversarial perturbation, that seek to
obfuscate or reshape traffic traces. However, these defenses often entail
trade-offs between privacy, usability, and system performance. Despite
extensive research, a comprehensive survey unifying WF datasets, attack
methodologies, and defense strategies remains absent. This paper fills that gap
by systematically categorizing existing WF research into three key domains:
datasets, attack models, and defense mechanisms. We provide an in-depth
comparative analysis of techniques, highlight their strengths and limitations
under diverse threat models, and discuss emerging challenges such as multi-tab
browsing and coarse-grained traffic features. By consolidating prior work and
identifying open research directions, this survey serves as a foundation for
advancing stronger privacy protection in Tor.

*Caelin Kaplan,Alexander Warnecke,Neil Archibald*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BlackIce 是一个开源、基于容器的红队工具包，面向大语言模型和经典机器学习模型，提供版本固定的 Docker 镜像，捆绑 14 款开源工具，统一命令行界面，可本地或云端运行，模块化结构便于社区扩展，目标是简化 AI 红队评估并降低门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的 AI 系统安全风险日益增大，AI 红队成为事前发现并修复漏洞的关键。工具众多且依赖管理复杂，机构规模小，缺乏统一、易用的实验环境。因此需要一个标准化、可复用的环境来降低进入门槛。

Method: 设计并实现一个容器化镜像，版本固定，整合 14 个开源工具，提供统一命令行界面；工具选择过程和评估类型的说明；支持本地或云端运行，模块化架构支持扩展。

Result: 描述容器镜像的架构、工具筛选过程和支持的评估类型，展示一个可重复的评估环境及初步用例。

Conclusion: BlackIce 简化了红队评估流程，降低入门成本，提升可重复性，且易于社区协作扩展，对 AI 安全与合规检查具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: AI models are being increasingly integrated into real-world systems, raising
significant concerns about their safety and security. Consequently, AI red
teaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and
address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While
numerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in
selecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as
well as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies
across isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small
number of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to
lower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that
simplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.
  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we
introduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red
teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML)
models. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that
bundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security
testing, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup,
initiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container,
either locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modular
architecture facilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily
adapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe
the architecture of the container image, the process used for selecting tools,
and the types of evaluations they support.

### [104] [Noisy Neighbor: Exploiting RDMA for Resource Exhaustion Attacks in Containerized Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12629)
*Gunwoo Kim,Taejune Park,Jinwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出 HT-Verbs，通过对每容器 RDMA verb 实时遥测和自适应资源分类，将 RNIC 资源分为热/暖/冷三层，并在不修改硬件的前提下对恶意工作负载进行限流，以恢复性能隔离和安全可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在容器化云环境中，RDMA 提高数据交换性能的同时，需要强健的性能隔离以防止一个容器的 RDMA 负载扰动其他容器，然而现有隔离方法难以应对 RNIC 微架构资源管理的复杂性。

Method: 在 NVIDIA BlueField-3 上对两类资源耗竭攻击（状态饱和和流水线饱和）进行实验分析，并测量对带宽、延迟、缓存未命中等指标的影响；提出并评估 HT-Verbs 框架的资源分区与限流策略。

Result: 实验结果显示：状态饱和攻击可导致最高 93.9% 带宽损失、延迟增加 1117 倍、缓存未命中增加 115%；流水线饱和攻击引发链路级拥塞和资源放大效应，小型 verb 请求也会产生过度资源消耗。HT-Verbs 通过阈值驱动的遥测和热/暖/冷分层实现对 abused workload 的抑制。

Conclusion: HT-Verbs 能在无需硬件修改的前提下恢复对 RNIC 资源的可预测性与安全性承诺，提供一种实用的、按容器粒度的资源管理与限流方法。

Abstract: In modern containerized cloud environments, the adoption of RDMA (Remote
Direct Memory Access) has expanded to reduce CPU overhead and enable
high-performance data exchange. Achieving this requires strong performance
isolation to ensure that one container's RDMA workload does not degrade the
performance of others, thereby maintaining critical security assurances.
However, existing isolation techniques are difficult to apply effectively due
to the complexity of microarchitectural resource management within RDMA NICs
(RNICs). This paper experimentally analyzes two types of resource exhaustion
attacks on NVIDIA BlueField-3: (i) state saturation attacks and (ii) pipeline
saturation attacks. Our results show that state saturation attacks can cause up
to a 93.9% loss in bandwidth, a 1,117x increase in latency, and a 115% rise in
cache misses for victim containers, while pipeline saturation attacks lead to
severe link-level congestion and significant amplification, where small verb
requests result in disproportionately high resource consumption. To mitigate
these threats and restore predictable security assurances, we propose HT-Verbs,
a threshold-driven framework based on real-time per-container RDMA verb
telemetry and adaptive resource classification that partitions RNIC resources
into hot, warm, and cold tiers and throttles abusive workloads without
requiring hardware modifications.

### [105] [Countermind: A Multi-Layered Security Architecture for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11837)
*Dominik Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Countermind 提出一套面向大语言模型的主动式多层安全体系，旨在通过在推理前和推理中强制性输入控制来降低 form-first 攻击的成功率，核心组件包括语义边界逻辑、参数空间限制、可自我规制的核心以及多模态输入沙箱，并提供以 ASR 与延迟开销为评估目标的计划性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御多为事后输出筛选，易脆弱且无法从根本上解决模型对信任指令与非信任数据的区分能力不足的问题。需要一种主动、前置、内在的防护机制来降低攻击面和错误传播。

Method: 提出一个分层安全架构 Countermind：1) 语义边界逻辑（SBL）配合时间耦合的文本加密器以降低明文提示注入面；2) 参数空间限制（PSR），以表示学习为基础的方式动态控制模型对内部语义簇的访问，减少语义漂移和危险行为；3) 安全自我监管核心，采用 OODA 循环和不可篡改的审计日志驱动的学习安全模块以自适应防御；4) 多模态输入沙箱与上下文防御，解决非文本数据和长期语义污染威胁。

Result: 论文目前给出的是体系设计与评估计划，尚未给出实验结果，预计通过量化 Attack Success Rate (ASR) 和评估潜在的延迟开销来验证有效性。

Conclusion: Countermind 旨在将防御从事后筛选转向前置、推理内的治理与输入验证，以降低攻击面、提升鲁棒性；最终效果需通过后续的实验评估来确认。

Abstract: The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally
challenged by "form-first" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking,
where malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional
defenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail
to address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted
instructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a
multi-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive,
post hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement
model. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally
validate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism
intended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output
is generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs
for: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text
Crypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface,
provided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction
(PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to
dynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the
goal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A
Secure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security
module to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal
Input Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from
non-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an
evaluation plan designed to quantify the proposed architecture's effectiveness
in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure
its potential latency overhead.

*Deeksha Hareesha Kulal,Chidozie Princewill Arannonu,Afsah Anwar,Nidhi Rastogi,Quamar Niyaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一种鲁棒的钓鱼邮件检测系统，通过增强文本预处理（拼写校正、分词/拆分）来对抗对抗性修改，并结合常用NLP特征提取和机器学习算法，在公开数据集上获得高检测性与在部署场景下的良好指标；同时对抗对抗性样本和大语言模型生成的钓鱼邮件进行鲁棒性评估，结果显示系统对AI驱动钓鱼威胁具有较强韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击因大语言模型生成的高质量仿真文本而日益猖獗，传统检测系统对LLM生成与对抗性扰动的邮件易产生误判，需要更鲁棒的预处理与检测方法。

Method: 提出增强的文本预处理流程（包括拼写纠正和分词/拆分），结合常用NLP特征提取与机器学习模型；在公开数据集上评估检测性能，并通过TextAttack框架的四种攻击方法生成的对抗性样本，以及LLM（如ChatGPT、Llama）生成的邮件，进行鲁棒性评估。

Result: 在模型部署设置下达到94.26%的检测准确率和84.39%的F1分数；对对抗样本与LLM生成样本具有鲁棒性，证实方法的韧性。

Conclusion: 增强的预处理和常用NLP特征结合机器学习的方法能有效提升钓鱼邮件检测的鲁棒性，尤其对AI驱动的钓鱼威胁具有一定的抵抗力，适合在真实部署场景中应用。

Abstract: Phishing remains a critical cybersecurity threat, especially with the advent
of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating highly convincing
malicious content. Unlike earlier phishing attempts which are identifiable by
grammatical errors, misspellings, incorrect phrasing, and inconsistent
formatting, LLM generated emails are grammatically sound, contextually
relevant, and linguistically natural. These advancements make phishing emails
increasingly difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones, challenging
traditional detection mechanisms. Conventional phishing detection systems often
fail when faced with emails crafted by LLMs or manipulated using adversarial
perturbation techniques. To address this challenge, we propose a robust
phishing email detection system featuring an enhanced text preprocessing
pipeline. This pipeline includes spelling correction and word splitting to
counteract adversarial modifications and improve detection accuracy. Our
approach integrates widely adopted natural language processing (NLP) feature
extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate our models
on publicly available datasets comprising both phishing and legitimate emails,
achieving a detection accuracy of 94.26% and F1-score of 84.39% in model
deployment setting. To assess robustness, we further evaluate our models using
adversarial phishing samples generated by four attack methods in Python
TextAttack framework. Additionally, we evaluate models' performance against
phishing emails generated by LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama. Results
highlight the resilience of models against evolving AI-powered phishing
threats.

*Yutong Cheng,Yang Liu,Changze Li,Dawn Song,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CTIArena：首个针对多源、知识增强型CTI的LLM基准测试，覆盖结构化/非结构化/混合三大类别及九项任务，对十种LLM进行评估；结果显示闭卷表现一般，但通过安全领域知识检索增强可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在CTI领域对LLMs的评估仍然受限于闭卷设定、任务范围窄以及单源分析，无法反映现实情境中的跨源推理需求。因此有必要建立一个覆盖多源、知识增强的综合基准，以系统评估与推动在CTI中的LLM应用。

Method: 提出CTIArena基准：将CTI分析分为结构化、非结构化和混合三大类别，进一步划分为九项任务，覆盖CTI分析的关键能力。对十种广泛使用的LLM进行评估，并通过设计的检索增强（retrieval-augmented）技术，将安全领域知识库接入以提升推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，大多数LLMs在闭卷设置下表现不佳，但通过知识检索增强后有明显提升，说明通用LLM在CTI领域仍受限，需要领域定制的检索增强策略才能充分发挥潜力。

Conclusion: CTIArena为CTI中LLM的系统评估提供了全面框架，强调跨源信息整合与领域知识注入的重要性；未来工作应聚焦开发更有效的领域专用检索增强方法，以充分释放LLMs在安全运营中的潜能。

Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing
critical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the
natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which
calls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several
early efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they
adopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without
leveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks,
lacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict
evaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require
reasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the
first benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source
CTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories,
structured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that
capture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate
ten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show
noticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our
designed retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the
limitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques
to fully unlock their potential for CTI.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合随机数生成方案，使用具受信执行环境（TEE）的物联网设备作为随机源，通过密码学工具聚合多源以生成可供 dApps 使用的最终随机数；在保证无偏性方面仅需一个诚实源，且可容忍拒绝响应的恶意参与者；并提供降低链上计算成本的具体实现与成本评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决链上 RNG 易受输入端操控，以及现有离线/离线方案要么安全性过强、要么复杂度高、成本高的问题，提供一个在安全性、成本与灵活性之间的折中框架。

Method: 以具备可信执行环境（TEE）的物联网设备作为随机源，结合一组加密/聚合工具对多源数据进行整合，得到最终可被 dApp 消费的随机数；设计一个容错机制，允许恶意参与者拒绝响应但仍保证无偏性；给出一个具体实现以降低链上计算量，从而降低成本；并对计算与 Gas 成本进行评估。

Result: 提出具体的混合 RNG 构造并给出成本评估，验证在改进方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合 RNG 框架为 dApps 提供了在安全性、成本与灵活性之间的权衡方案，能在实际部署中降低链上负担，并通过至少一个诚实源保障偏置性。

Abstract: Random numbers play a vital role in many decentralized applications (dApps),
such as gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.
  Existing random number provision mechanisms can be roughly divided into two
categories, on-chain, and off-chain.
  On-chain approaches usually rely on the blockchain as the major input and all
computations are done by blockchain nodes.
  The major risk for this type of method is that the input itself is
susceptible to the adversary's influence.
  Off-chain approaches, as the name suggested, complete the generation without
the involvement of blockchain nodes and share the result directly with a dApp.
  These mechanisms usually have a strong security assumption and high
complexity.
  To mitigate these limitations and provide a framework that allows a dApp to
balance different factors involved in random number generation, we propose a
hybrid random number generation solution that leverages IoT devices equipped
with trusted execution environment (TEE) as the randomness sources, and then
utilizes a set of cryptographic tools to aggregate the multiple sources and
obtain the final random number that can be consumed by the dApp.
  The new approach only needs one honest random source to guarantee the
unbiasedness of the final random number and a user can configure the system to
tolerate malicious participants who can refuse to respond to avoid unfavored
results.
  We also provide a concrete construction that can further reduce the on-chain
computation complexity to lower the cost of the solution in practice.
  We evaluate the computation and gas costs to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the improvement.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Kun-IE: 一种结合2D-SCPHM超混沌映射与 Kun-SCAN 置换的新型图像加密框架，提升伪随机性与像素相关性抵抗性，能适用于任意尺寸的图像，实验表明对多种 cryptanalytic 攻击具有鲁棒性，且代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于混沌的图像加密在置换-扩散环节存在不足，易受统计攻击与伪随机性不足的影响。需提供更强的混沌区间、改进的像素相关性降低策略以及对任意尺寸图像的兼容性。

Method: 提出二维 Sin-Cos Pi 超混沌映射（2D-SCPHM）以获得更广的混沌区间和更优的伪随机序列；引入 Kun-SCAN 置换策略显著降低像素相关性；将二者集成于 Kun-IE 框架，支持任意尺寸图像的加密；提供开源实现。

Result: 实验与安全分析显示，该框架在多种 cryptanalytic 攻击下具有鲁棒性，提升了像素混合的随机性和统计攻击的抵抗力；证明了在安全性与灵活性之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: Kun-IE 作为一个灵活、鲁棒的图像加密解决方案，结合更强的混沌源与高效的置换策略，适用于安全通信并具备可扩展性，代码可获得。

Abstract: Chaotic systems play a key role in modern image encryption due to their
sensitivity to initial conditions, ergodicity, and complex dynamics. However,
many existing chaos-based encryption methods suffer from vulnerabilities, such
as inadequate permutation and diffusion, and suboptimal pseudorandom
properties. This paper presents Kun-IE, a novel encryption framework designed
to address these issues. The framework features two key contributions: the
development of the 2D Sin-Cos Pi Hyperchaotic Map (2D-SCPHM), which offers a
broader chaotic range and superior pseudorandom sequence generation, and the
introduction of Kun-SCAN, a novel permutation strategy that significantly
reduces pixel correlations, enhancing resistance to statistical attacks. Kun-IE
is flexible and supports encryption for images of any size. Experimental
results and security analyses demonstrate its robustness against various
cryptanalytic attacks, making it a strong solution for secure image
communication. The code is available at this

TL;DR: 提出 Locket，一种首个鲁棒且可扩展的 FLoTE，通过在 LLM 上合并适配器实现付费解锁，能够对锁定特征100%拒绝、对解锁特征的效用降幅<7%，对攻击的成功率<5%，并可扩展至多特征/多客户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分层订阅模式下，现有的特征锁定方法难以兼顾强防盗和用户体验，缺乏可扩展性。需要一种对锁定特征具强拒绝性、最小效用损失、对抗盗用且能扩展到多特征/多客户的解决方案。

Method: 提出 Locket，通过在大语言模型上附着适配器的合并方法，对锁定特征进行拒绝，同时在未锁定特征中保持较高的效用。通过评估来验证鲁棒性和可扩展性，覆盖多特征和多客户端场景。

Result: 实验显示对锁定特征100%拒绝，未锁定特征的效用降幅≤7%，攻击成功率≤5%，且可以扩展到多特征和多客户。

Conclusion: Locket 是首个鲁棒、可扩展的 FLoTE，展示了将付费解锁纳入商业化景观的可行性，但在实际部署中的鲁棒性、隐私与合规性需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Chatbot providers (e.g., OpenAI) rely on tiered subscription schemes to
generate revenue, offering basic models for free users, and advanced models for
paying subscribers. However, a finer-grained pay-to-unlock scheme for premium
features (e.g., math, coding) is thought to be more economically viable for the
providers. Such a scheme requires a feature-locking technique (FLoTE) which is
(i) effective in refusing locked features, (ii) utility-preserving for unlocked
features, (iii) robust against evasion or unauthorized credential sharing, and
(iv) scalable to multiple features and users. However, existing FLoTEs (e.g.,
password-locked models) are not robust or scalable. We present Locket, the
first robust and scalable FLoTE to enable pay-to-unlock schemes. Locket uses a
novel merging approach to attach adapters to an LLM for refusing unauthorized
features. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that Locket is effective ($100$%
refusal on locked features), utility-preserving ($\leq 7$% utility degradation
in unlocked features), robust ($\leq 5$% attack success rate), and scales to
multiple features and clients.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VeilAudit 提供一种跨链审计框架，通过可链接的审计标签和零知识证明实现对同一匿名实体的行为可关联性，同时保护身份隐私，支持门槛式身份揭示和基于行为历史的声誉构建，在多条 EVM 链上的原型系统表明其在现今多链环境中具可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨链互操作性在隐私保护与监管责任之间存在根本张力，现有解决方案在完全匿名与强制身份披露之间只提供极端选择，阻碍在受监管金融场景中的采用。

Method: 提出 VeilAudit 框架，核心是 Auditor Only Linkability：用户生成的 Linkable Audit Tag 包含能证明其有效性的零知识证明且不暴露主钱包地址，以及仅指定审计方可测试的密文以实现行为关联。并引入门槛 gated 的身份揭示机制以平衡隐私与合规。此外提供一种在伪匿名环境中构建声誉的机制，基于可验证的行为历史，用于跨链信用评分等应用；在多个 EVM 链上实现原型。

Result: 对安全性给出形式化保障，完成原型实现，实验/评估表明在当今多链环境中具有实际可行性。

Conclusion: VeilAudit 在隐私与合规之间取得平衡，能够在不暴露身份的前提下实现可审计的跨链行为关联，促进合规与基于行为的声誉应用；但仍需关注信任的审计方、治理机制以及潜在的性能和合规挑战。

Abstract: Cross chain interoperability in blockchain systems exposes a fundamental
tension between user privacy and regulatory accountability. Existing solutions
enforce an all or nothing choice between full anonymity and mandatory identity
disclosure, which limits adoption in regulated financial settings. We present
VeilAudit, a cross chain auditing framework that introduces Auditor Only
Linkability, which allows auditors to link transaction behaviors that originate
from the same anonymous entity without learning its identity. VeilAudit
achieves this with a user generated Linkable Audit Tag that embeds a zero
knowledge proof to attest to its validity without exposing the user master
wallet address, and with a special ciphertext that only designated auditors can
test for linkage. To balance privacy and compliance, VeilAudit also supports
threshold gated identity revelation under due process. VeilAudit further
provides a mechanism for building reputation in pseudonymous environments,
which enables applications such as cross chain credit scoring based on
verifiable behavioral history. We formalize the security guarantees and develop
a prototype that spans multiple EVM chains. Our evaluation shows that the
framework is practical for today multichain environments.

### [112] [Leaking Queries On Secure Stream Processing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12172)
*Hung Pham,Viet Vo,Tien Tuan Anh Dinh,Duc Tran,Shuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 通过基于定时侧信道的攻击，攻击者可从在 SGX 下运行的流处理系统中提取查询逻辑，成功率高达 92%，并给出缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云端不可信任环境下的流式处理应用日益普及，保护不仅是数据，还包括查询逻辑本身，防止攻击者通过执行时间模式推断出应用逻辑。

Method: 分两阶段攻击：离线阶段对单个流算子执行时间进行建模以识别算子；在线阶段对构成查询的算子进行分离、监控执行并用离线模型还原查询结构。实验基于 SecureStream 与 NEXMark 的数据流基准。

Result: 实验结果表明攻击在多种情景下可达到约 92% 的成功率，充分证明在 SGX 环境下的流处理系统存在可行的查询泄露风险。

Conclusion: 需要在流处理系统中引入防护，降低侧信道影响，提出在不显著增加开销的前提下的缓解方法，例如对时序的抗侧信道实现、随机化、混淆或额外的安全策略。

Abstract: Stream processing systems are important in modern applications in which data
arrive continuously and need to be processed in real time. Because of their
resource and scalability requirements, many of these systems run on the cloud,
which is considered untrusted. Existing works on securing databases on the
cloud focus on protecting the data, and most systems leverage trusted hardware
for high performance. However, in stream processing systems, queries are as
sensitive as the data because they contain the application logics.
  We demonstrate that it is practical to extract the queries from stream
processing systems that use Intel SGX for securing the execution engine. The
attack performed by a malicious cloud provider is based on timing side
channels, and it works in two phases. In the offline phase, the attacker
profiles the execution time of individual stream operators, based on synthetic
data. This phase outputs a model that identifies individual stream operators.
In the online phase, the attacker isolates the operators that make up the
query, monitors its execution, and recovers the operators using the model in
the previous phase. We implement the attack based on popular data stream
benchmarks using SecureStream and NEXMark, and demonstrate attack success rates
of up to 92%. We further discuss approaches that can harden streaming
processing systems against our attacks without incurring high overhead.

*Yuqi Jia,Yupei Liu,Zedian Shao,Jinyuan Jia,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出 PromptLocate，一种三步法用于在污染数据中本地化注入提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示注入攻击对大语言模型的安全性和数据取证造成挑战，但缺乏定位 injected prompts 的方法。

Method: 1) 将污染数据分割为语义连贯的片段；2) 识别被注入指令污染的片段；3) 确定被注入数据污染的片段。

Result: 在评估中覆盖八种现有攻击和八种自适应攻击，PromptLocate 能准确定位注入的提示。

Conclusion: 这是在提示注入定位领域的首次研究，提供有用的工具用于事后取证和数据恢复，并为未来相关工作奠定基础。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks deceive a large language model into completing an
attacker-specified task instead of its intended task by contaminating its input
data with an injected prompt, which consists of injected instruction(s) and
data. Localizing the injected prompt within contaminated data is crucial for
post-attack forensic analysis and data recovery. Despite its growing
importance, prompt injection localization remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we bridge this gap by proposing PromptLocate, the first method for
localizing injected prompts. PromptLocate comprises three steps: (1) splitting
the contaminated data into semantically coherent segments, (2) identifying
segments contaminated by injected instructions, and (3) pinpointing segments
contaminated by injected data. We show PromptLocate accurately localizes
injected prompts across eight existing and eight adaptive attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 通过潜在空间的范数统计建模对隐写进行分析，构建似然比检验检测 Stego 与 Cover 的差异，并研究提示词、扩散步数的影响，以及通过对范数随机化来降低检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证潜在空间隐写的可检测性与鲁棒性，评估在潜在扩散模型中的隐写被检测的可能性，以及提出潜在空间隐写的防御方向。

Method: 把潜在向量的范数在 Cover 与 Stego 情况下建模为高斯分布（Stego 与 Cover 方差不同），Stego 向量分布在超球面；推导并实现一个泊松似然比测试（LRT）用于联合检测；分析提示词知识和扩散步数对结果的影响；提出在生成前随机采样范数以增加隐写不可检测性的方法。

Result: 实验表明，在潜在空间中，Cover 向量近似独立高斯，Stego 向量集中在超球面；LRT 能实现对隐写的联合检测；提示词与扩散步数的知识会影响检测能力；通过随机化范数，可在潜在空间降低隐写被发现的风险。

Conclusion: 潜在空间隐写的安全性与可检测性强相关，且对潜在向量范数的建模是有效的隐写分析路径；在实践中，可以通过随机化范数等策略提升隐写隐藏性，但若对潜在空间进行建模分析，仍可实现有效检测。

Abstract: Steganographic schemes dedicated to generated images modify the seed vector
in the latent space to embed a message, whereas most steganalysis methods
attempt to detect the embedding in the image space. This paper proposes to
perform steganalysis in the latent space by modeling the statistical
distribution of the norm of the latent vector. Specifically, we analyze the
practical security of a scheme proposed by Hu et. al. for latent diffusion
models, which is both robust and practically undetectable when steganalysis is
performed on generated images. We show that after embedding, the Stego (latent)
vector is distributed on a hypersphere while the Cover vector is i.i.d.
Gaussian. By going from the image space to the latent space, we show that it is
possible to model the norm of the vector in the latent space under the Cover or
Stego hypothesis as Gaussian distributions with different variances. A
Likelihood Ratio Test is then derived to perform pooled steganalysis. The
impact of the potential knowledge of the prompt and the number of diffusion
steps, is also studied. Additionally, we also show how, by randomly sampling
the norm of the latent vector before generation, the initial Stego scheme
becomes undetectable in the latent space.

### [115] [Formal Models and Convergence Analysis for Context-Aware Security Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12440)
*Ayush Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出一个用于ML增强自适应系统的上下文感知安全验证的正式框架，引入上下文完整性等新属性，给出样本复杂度、信息论界限、ML载荷生成器收敛和组合正确性等理论保证，并与静态上下文无感知验证做出分离；通过对97,224个攻击样本的实验验证理论预测，显示在数据集增长和上下文丰富度下的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ML驱动的自适应系统中，单纯的静态、上下文无感知的验证在面对多样化的攻击上下文时往往不足以提供可证明的安全保证。需要一个形式化框架，能够捕捉上下文信息的丰富性对检测能力和验证成功的影响，并提供可证明的边界与收敛性。

Method: 提出上下文完备性等新安全属性，建立形式化框架；给出与上下文信息量相关的检测能力界限、样本复杂度界限及载荷生成器的收敛性及组合性正确性证明；给出静态上下文无感知验证器与上下文感知自适应验证器之间的分离结论；通过对97,224个利用样本的控制实验验证理论预测。

Result: 理论结果包括：样本复杂度界限、信息论下界与上下文丰富性之间的关系、ML载荷生成器的收敛性、以及组合正确性界限。经验结果包括检测准确率从58%提升到69.93%、随着上下文丰富度提升成功概率从51%提升到82%、训练损失以O(1/√T)收敛、以及假阳性率10.19%在理论上界12%之内。

Conclusion: 在给定的假设条件下，理论上有证据表明自适应的、上下文感知的验证相较静态方法能获得可证明的改进，并保持健全性。

Abstract: We present a formal framework for context-aware security verification that
establishes provable guarantees for ML-enhanced adaptive systems. We introduce
context-completeness - a new security property - and prove: (1) sample
complexity bounds showing when adaptive verification succeeds, (2)
information-theoretic limits relating context richness to detection capability,
(3) convergence guarantees for ML-based payload generators, and (4)
compositional soundness bounds. We further provide a formal separation between
static context-blind verifiers and context-aware adaptive verifiers: for a
natural family of targets, any static verifier with finite payload budget
achieves completeness at most alpha, while a context-aware verifier with
sufficient information achieves completeness greater than alpha. We validate
our theoretical predictions through controlled experiments on 97,224 exploit
samples, demonstrating: detection accuracy improving from 58% to 69.93% with
dataset growth, success probability increasing from 51% to 82% with context
enrichment, training loss converging at O(1/sqrt(T)) rate, and false positive
rate (10.19%) within theoretical bounds (12%). Our results show that
theoretically-grounded adaptive verification achieves provable improvements
over static approaches under stated assumptions while maintaining soundness
guarantees.

### [116] [Proof of Cloud: Data Center Execution Assurance for Confidential VMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12469)
*Filip Rezabek,Moe Mahhouk,Andrew Miller,Stefan Genchev,Quintus Kilbourn,Georg Carle,Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出 Data Center Execution Assurance（DCEA）框架，通过 vTPM 锚定的测量，将 CVM 与底层平台绑定，确保 CVM 启动证据与 TPM quotes 指向同一物理机，从而实现对云端“证明云”的可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 CVMs 受限于硬件，TEEs 的威胁模型通常不考虑物理访问者；现有远程 attestation 无法验证 CVM 是否在物理上受信任的平台上运行，因此难以与 TEE 厂商的威胁模型对齐，产生信任缺口。

Method: 设计与实现 DCEA，利用 vTPM-anchored 测量绑定 CVM 与底层平台，确保 CVM 启动证据和 TPM quotes 引用同一物理机；利用数据中心对 TPM 的可识别性，支持在使用 vTPMs 的 CVM、云提供商完全受控的软件栈以及单租户裸金属场景中的部署；结合 Intel TXT 进行可信启动。

Result: 给出在 Google Cloud 和 Intel TDX 上的候选实现，使用 Intel TXT 实现可信启动；实现评估证明平台原点与完整性、抵御重放与伪造等攻击，提升跨平台的可验证性。

Conclusion: 为在较低信任环境中部署高保证的保密工作负载提供可行路径，细化 CVM 的威胁模型，使平台层的信任与 TEE 供应商的模型对齐，从而增强云端隐私工作负载的可验证性与可部署性。

Abstract: Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) protect data in use by running workloads
inside hardware-isolated environments. In doing so, they also inherit the
limitations of the underlying hardware. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs),
which enforce this isolation, explicitly exclude adversaries with physical
access from their threat model. Commercial TEEs, e.g., Intel TDX, thus assume
infrastructure providers do not physically exploit hardware and serve as
safeguards instead. This creates a tension: tenants must trust provider
integrity at the hardware layer, yet existing remote attestation offers no way
to verify that CVMs actually run on physically trusted platforms, leaving
today's CVM deployments unable to demonstrate that their guarantees align with
the TEE vendor's threat model.
  We bridge this confidence gap with Data Center Execution Assurance (DCEA), a
design generating "Proofs of Cloud". DCEA binds a CVM to its underlying
platform using vTPM-anchored measurements, ensuring CVM launch evidence and TPM
quotes refer to the same physical chassis.
  This takes advantage of the fact that data centers are often identifiable via
TPMs. Our approach applies to CVMs accessing vTPMs and running on top of
software stacks fully controlled by the cloud provider, as well as
single-tenant bare-metal deployments with discrete TPMs. We trust providers for
integrity (certificate issuance), but not for the confidentiality of
CVM-visible state. DCEA enables remote verification of a CVM's platform origin
and integrity, mitigating attacks like replay and attestation proxying. We
include a candidate implementation on Google Cloud and Intel TDX that leverages
Intel TXT for trusted launch. Our design refines CVMs' threat model and
provides a practical path for deploying high-assurance, confidential workloads
in minimally trusted environments.

Method: 对 Facebook 的密码存储方案进行分析，提出一个利用实例来展现其安全漏洞，并讨论其影响，同时遵循伦理披露与厂商通知指南。

Result: 首次提供的利用示例，证明该存储方案的安全弱点确实存在，并展示了在升级路径中可能被引入的风险。

Conclusion: 强调需要更严格的升级流程与安全评估，呼吁遵循伦理披露、厂商通知，并改进密码哈希策略以降低大规模系统的风险。

Abstract: Modern web and digital application password storage relies on password
hashing for storage and security. Ad-hoc upgrade of password storage to keep up
with hash algorithm norms may be used to save costs but can introduce
unforeseen vulnerabilities. This is the case in the password storage scheme
used by Meta Platforms which services several billion monthly users worldwide.
In this paper we present the first example of an exploit which demonstrates the
security weakness of Facebook's password storage scheme, and discuss its
implications. Proper ethical disclosure guidelines and vendor notification were
followed.
