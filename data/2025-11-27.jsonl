This doubles the theoretical throughput compared to rank 2 MIMO and also improves reception performance. However, 4x4 MIMO support on low-band frequencies (<1 GHz) is absent in every commercial UEs, with the exception of the Xperia 1 flagship smartphones manufactured by Sony Mobile and the Xiaomi 14 Pro as of January 2024. The reason most manufacturers omit 4x4 MIMO support for low-band frequencies is likely due to design challenges or relatively small performance gains in real-world usage due to the lack of 4T4R deployment on low-band by mobile network operators around the world.\n  In Thailand, 4T4R deployment on the b28/n28 (APT) band is common on True-H and dtac networks, enabling 4x4 MIMO transmission on supported UEs. In this paper, the real-world 4x4 MIMO performance on the b28/n28 (APT) band will be investigated by evaluating the reliability test under different signal conditions and the maximum throughput test by evaluating the performance under optimal conditions, using the Sony Xperia 1 III and the Sony Xperia 1 IV smartphone. Devices from other manufacturers are also used in the experiment to investigate the performance with 2Rx antennas for comparison. Through firmware modifications, the Sony Xperia 1 III and IV can be configured to use only 2 Rx ports on low-band, enabling the collection of comparative 2 Rx performance data as a reference."}

One of the main applications of 5G is the real-time distribution of Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content with a resolution of 4K or 8K. In Q2/2021, Advanced Info Service (AIS), the biggest operator in Thailand, launched 5G SA, providing both 5G SA/NSA service nationwide in addition to the existing LTE network. While many parts of the world are still in process of rolling out the first phase of 5G in Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, 5G SA in Thailand already covers more than 76% of the population.\n  In this paper, UHD video will be a real-time live streaming via MPEG-DASH over different mobile network technologies with minimal buffer size to provide the lowest latency. Then, performance such as the number of dropped segments, MAC throughput, and latency are evaluated in various situations such as stationary, moving in the urban area, moving at high speed, and also an ideal condition with maximum SINR. It has been found that 5G SA can deliver more than 95% of the UHD video segment successfully within the required time window in all situations, while 5G NSA produced mixed results depending on the condition of the LTE network. The result also reveals that the LTE network failed to deliver more than 20% of the video segment within the deadline, which shows that 5G SA is absolutely necessary for low-latency UHD video streaming and 5G NSA may not be good enough for such task as it relies on the legacy control signal."}

To address these threats to data confidentiality, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven secure access strategy. The strategy leverages a virtual replica of the physical SAGIN environment within the DT framework to continuously assess dynamic eavesdropping risks by quantifying secrecy capacity. Operating within this DT framework, an evolutionary game model dynamically balances the DT-updated secrecy capacity against queuing delay, steering IoT devices toward more secure and efficient access decisions. Furthermore, a novel distributed algorithm, integral to the DT operation, is developed to obtain the equilibrium access strategy for each device in a scalable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based approach substantially improves the security of SAGIN-enabled IoT networks. Additionally, it effectively balances system load, prevents overload occurrences, and decreases queuing delay compared to benchmark schemes, thereby comprehensively improving overall network performance."}

We simultaneously search for the optimal IO characterization of a system and synthesize a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) storage function via a convex optimization problem. To do so, we reformulate the relationship between the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality and the dissipation inequality as an linear matrix inequality (LMI) and develop novel LMI bounds for a triangulation. Further, we develop a method to synthesize a combined quadratic and CPA storage function to expand the systems the optimization problem is applicable to. Finally, we demonstrate that our method will always find a feasible IO characterization and a CPA or quadratic storage function given that the system is strictly locally dissipative."}

Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

Due to the spatial arrangement of transmitter (Tx) coils embedded into the ER pavement, the power drawn by the EV's receiver (Rx) coil is oscillatory in nature. Therefore, understanding the dynamic behavior of the total DWPT load is important for power system dynamic studies. To this end, we model the load of individual EVs in the time and frequency domains for constant EV speed. We establish that a nonlinear control scheme implemented in existing DWPT-enabled EVs exhibits milder frequency harmonics compared to its linear alternative. According to this model, the harmonics of an EV load decrease in amplitude with the Rx coil length. We further propose and analyze stochastic models for the total DWPT load served by an ER segment. Our models explain how the EV composition on the ER affects its frequency spectrum. Interestingly, we show that serving more EVs with longer Rx coils (trucks) does not necessarily entail milder harmonics. Our analytical findings are corroborated using realistic flows from a traffic simulator and offer valuable insights to grid operators and ER designers."}

However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m."}

The accuracy improvement of data imputation extends to private data analyses across distributed databases. However, existing data imputation methods violate the privacy of the data rendering the privacy protection in the downstream analyses obsolete. We conclude that private data analysis requires private data imputation.\n  In this paper, we present the first optimized protocols for private data imputation. We consider the case of horizontally and vertically split data sets. Our optimization aims to reduce most of the computation to private set intersection (or at least oblivious programmable pseudo-random function) protocols which can be very efficiently computed. We show that private data imputation has -- on average across all evaluated datasets -- an accuracy advantage of 20\\% in case of vertically split data and 5\\% in case of horizontally split data over imputing data locally. In case of the worst data split we observed that imputing using our method resulted in an increase of up to 32.7 times in the quality of imputation over the vertically split data and 3.4 times in case of horizontally split data. Our protocols are very efficient and run in 2.4 seconds in case of vertically split data and 8.4 seconds in case of horizontally split data for 100,000 records evaluated in the 10 Gbps network setting, performing one data imputation."}

It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture."}

An optional initialization routine enhances global MPP (GMPP) tracking under PSC. Extensive simulations, including irradiance recordings from freely moving rodent subjects relevant to the targeted application, and tests across varying converter topologies and temperatures, demonstrate its robust, topology-independent performance. The proposed algorithm achieves 99.94 percent MPPT efficiency under standard test conditions (STC), 99.21 percent when applied to experimental data, and more than 99.6 percent for the tested temperature profiles. Under PSC, the initialization routine improves tracking efficiency by up to 7.8 percent. A normalized gate-level complexity analysis and a unified figure-of-merit (FoM) incorporating efficiency, tracking time, and computational cost demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 35 state-of-the-art P&O-based MPPT algorithms.

Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical.

Understanding the skin temperature and having comfortable wearable sensors that would monitor skin temperature in a real-time outdoor environment would be useful. The system would help the user and orthopedic technician to provide feedback and changes that might be required in the prosthesis. Hence in this paper, a series of experiments are conducted in order to understand and characterize the system behavior and compare a general thermistor and a modified thermistor as a potential method of temperature measurement for outdoor usage of prostheses. The paper goes on to compare the different modified thermistors behavior with their regular counterpart and highlights the challenges and improvement areas needed for such a modified thermistor for outdoor temperature monitoring in a prosthetic system. Initial results show that some of the modified thermistors showed better temperature recording compared to the rest. Finally, such modified thermistors can be a potential alternative for comfortable temperature measurement embedded in the prosthesis system. Such a system can provide valuable insights into temperature distribution and an early warning system for skin problems"}

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models."}

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings."}

Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability.

As MCP adoption grows across community servers and major platforms, organizations encounter threats that existing AI governance frameworks (such as NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001) do not yet cover in detail. We focus on three types of adversaries that take advantage of MCP s flexibility: content-injection attackers that embed malicious instructions into otherwise legitimate data; supply-chain attackers who distribute compromised servers; and agents who become unintentional adversaries by over-stepping their role. Based on early incidents and proof-of-concept attacks, we describe how MCP can increase the attack surface through data-driven exfiltration, tool poisoning, and cross-system privilege escalation. In response, we propose a set of practical controls, including per-user authentication with scoped authorization, provenance tracking across agent workflows, containerized sandboxing with input/output checks, inline policy enforcement with DLP and anomaly detection, and centralized governance using private registries or gateway layers. The aim is to help organizations ensure that unvetted code does not run outside a sandbox, tools are not used beyond their intended scope, data exfiltration attempts are detectable, and actions can be audited end-to-end.

Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.\n  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.\n  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings."}

We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Sparse array technique using stochastic optimization methods is one of promising techniques to reduce channel counts while due to the stochastic nature of these methods, the optimized results are usually unstable. In this work, we introduce a sparse array design approach that formulates the synthesis problem of sparse arrays as second-order cone programming (SOCP) and a re-weighted L1 technique is implemented to sequentially optimize the SOCP. Based on this method, an on-grid quasi-flatten side-lobe (Q-Flats) 2D sparse array with side-lobe level (SLL) no more than -21.26 dB and 252 activated elements is designed, which aims to achieve as high contrast performance as possible under the limits of resolution and maximum number of independent channels (i.e., 256). The imaging performance of the Q-Flats array was compared with those of a corresponding dense array (Dense), a Fermat spiral array (Spiral) and a spatially 50%-Tukey tapered spiral array (Spiral-Taper) using Field II simulations in a multi-angle steered diverging wave transmission scheme. It was demonstrated that the Dense achieved the best resolution and contrast and the Spiral-Taper the worst. The Q-Flats showed better resolution (about 3%) but slightly worse contrast than the Spiral. All the results indicate the re-weighted L1 SOCP method is a promising and flexible method for seeking trade-offs among resolution, contrast, and number of activated elements."}

An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines."}

We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\\le 4)$.

MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations.

Since users' sensitivity to location data varies based on factors such as stay duration, access frequency, and semantic sensitivity, implementing personalized privacy protection is imperative. This paper proposes a Personalized Trajectory Privacy Protection Mechanism (PTPPM) to address these challenges. Our approach begins by modeling an attacker's knowledge of a user's trajectory spatiotemporal correlations, which enables the attacker to identify possible location sets and disregard low-probability location sets. To combat this, we integrate geo-indistinguishability with distortion privacy, allowing users to customize their privacy preferences through a configurable privacy budget and expected inference error bound. This approach provides the theoretical framework for constructing a Protection Location Set (PLS) that obscures users' actual locations. Additionally, we introduce a Personalized Privacy Budget Allocation Algorithm (PPBA), which assesses the sensitivity of locations based on trajectory data and allocates privacy budgets accordingly. This algorithm considers factors such as location semantics and road network constraints. Furthermore, we propose a Permute-and-Flip mechanism that generates perturbed locations while minimizing perturbation distance, thus balancing privacy protection and Quality of Service (QoS). Simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms existing benchmarks, offering superior privacy protection while maintaining user QoS requirements."}

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO.

We first establish a sharp threshold for consensus. For a broad class of non-decreasing, Lipschitz-continuous interactions, an explicit inequality linking the interaction's Lipschitz constant to the second-largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix of the interaction graph confines all system equilibria to the synchronization manifold. This condition is shown to be a sharp threshold, as its violation permits the emergence of non-synchronized equilibria. We also demonstrate that such clustered states can only arise if the interaction law itself possesses specific structural properties, such as unstable fixed points. For the clustered states that emerge, we introduce a formal framework using Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theory to quantify their robustness. This approach allows us to prove that the internal cohesion of a cluster is robust to perturbations from the rest of the network. The analysis reveals a fundamental principle: cluster coherence is limited not by the magnitude of external influence, but by its heterogeneity across internal nodes. This unified framework, explaining both the sharp breakdown of consensus and the quantifiable robustness of the resulting modular structures, is validated on Zachary's Karate Club network, used as a classic benchmark for community structure."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity.

This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size.

Existing watermarking techniques either target base models or verify LoRA modules themselves, yet they fail to propagate watermarks to generated images, leaving a critical gap in traceability. Moreover, traceability watermarking designed for base models is not tightly coupled with stylization and often introduces visual degradation or high false-positive detection rates. To address these limitations, we propose AuthenLoRA, a unified watermarking framework that embeds imperceptible, traceable watermarks directly into the LoRA training process while preserving stylization quality. AuthenLoRA employs a dual-objective optimization strategy that jointly learns the target style distribution and the watermark-induced distribution shift, ensuring that any image generated with the watermarked LoRA reliably carries the watermark. We further design an expanded LoRA architecture for enhanced multi-scale adaptation and introduce a zero-message regularization mechanism that substantially reduces false positives during watermark verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuthenLoRA achieves high-fidelity stylization, robust watermark propagation, and significantly lower false-positive rates compared with existing approaches.

This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events."}

In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques.\n  This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network.\n  Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported."}

This paper presents a response-based frequency stability assessment method that uses disturbance power, inferred from generator electrical responses, to provide a unified treatment of multi-scale disturbances. Unanticipated disturbances are first classified into short-term and permanent events; permanent disturbances are further divided into step, second-level slope and minute-level slope disturbances. Based on the measured power responses of generator groups, a unified disturbance-power model is constructed to identify the disturbance type online and to quantify disturbance intensity through the disturbance power and its rate of change. Analytical frequency-response models are then derived for each disturbance class. For step disturbances, the maximum tolerable disturbance power is obtained under steady-state and transient frequency deviation constraints, and a safety-margin index is defined. For slope-type disturbances, an improved system frequency response (SFR) model and the rotor motion equation after exhaustion of primary frequency regulation are used to compute the over-limit time of frequency deviation. The proposed response-based assessment method is validated on the CSEE-FS frequency-stability benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy for quantitative frequency stability assessment in high-renewable power systems."}

However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m."}

This paper presents a controlled experiment involving Master's students performing code comprehension tasks on applications hardened with obfuscation.

Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery."}

For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels."}

The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme."}

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning.

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy).

This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids."}

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem."}

Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design."}

We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order.

Distance protection is implemented with a mho characteristic, while line differential protection uses an alpha-plane approach. Results show that phase-to-ground loops in distance protection can substantially overestimate the fault location near the Zone-1 reach. For line differential protection, external faults may cause the operating point to briefly enter the trip region of the alpha-plane, even for the healthy-phase in ABG faults under GFL control and during the initial moments of the fault, demanding strong external security measures. These findings highlight that modern converter controls, together with current limitation and sequence-current prioritization, can compromise the reliability and security of traditional protection schemes."}

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives."}

By analyzing confirmed disturbances from 2013 to 2024, we identify trends in regional inertia and frequency dynamics, highlighting their relationship with renewable generation and the evolving duck curve. Regional RoCoF values were up to six times higher than interconnection-wide values, coinciding with declining inertia. Recent recovery in inertia is attributed to the increased deployment of battery energy storage systems with synthetic inertia capabilities.

In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement."}

Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance.

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.

Extending the well-known optimality of bang-bang evasion maneuvers in deterministic settings to the realm of realistic, stochastic evasion scenarios, we firstly prove that an optimal evasion strategy always exists, and that the set of optimal solutions includes at least one bang-bang policy, rendering the resulting optimal control problem finite-dimensional. Leveraging this structure, we secondly propose the closed-loop terminal-set-based evasion (TSE) strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation against a proportional navigation pursuer.

In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models."}

Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings.

MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies."}

We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance.

GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet).

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance."}

However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research."}

While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data.

Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the \"user-item decoupling\" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments.

DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality."}

A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs."}

Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes.

Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness.

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension."}

This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes."}

In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention."}

AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC.

Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models."}

However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions."}

While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research."}

Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively.

At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment.

Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics."}

By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning."}

This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response."}

We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning."}

This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability."}

This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale."}

We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations."}
