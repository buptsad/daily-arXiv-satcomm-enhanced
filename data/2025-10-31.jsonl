For visual content, this paradigm\nshifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic\nstructure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches\ngenerally follow one of two paths: transmitting only text descriptions, which\noften fail to capture precise spatial layouts and fine-grained appearance\ndetails; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which\ntends to introduce substantial semantic redundancy. A key challenge, therefore,\nis to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and\nvisual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper\nintroduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive\nretransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a\nlimited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based\ninpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency\nmechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image\nand the original text description.

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger."}

This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates.

To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization.

The core challenge arises from the complex coupling between\ncommunication SINR requirements and sensing performance metrics. To efficiently\naddress this challenge, we first establish the equivalence between the original\nISAC beamforming problem and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR), derive its\nLagrangian dual formulation, and further reformulate it as a generalized\ndownlink beamforming (GDB) problem with potentially indefinite weighting\nmatrices. Compared to the classical DB problem, the presence of indefinite\nweighting matrices in the GDB problem introduces substantial analytical and\ncomputational challenges.

Moreover, both approaches\nemploy static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label\nbackdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked\nsample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample,\nfundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The\ncore innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three\ncomponents: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target\nsample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss\nmaintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box\ntesting is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined\nbackdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential\nwatermark removal attacks."}

We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing.

Unfortunately, classical high-resolution\ntechniques require multi-element arrays and extensive snapshot collection,\nwhile generic Machine Learning (ML) approaches often yield black-box models\nthat lack physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a\nSymbolic Regression (SR)-based ML framework. Namely, Symbolic Regression-based\nAngle of Arrival and Beam Pattern Estimator (SABER), a constrained\nsymbolic-regression framework that automatically discovers closed-form beam\npattern and AoA models from path loss measurements with interpretability. SABER\nachieves high accuracy while bridging the gap between opaque ML methods and\ninterpretable physics-driven estimators. First, we validate our approach in a\ncontrolled free-space anechoic chamber, showing that both direct inversion of\nthe known $\\cos^n$ beam and a low-order polynomial surrogate achieve sub-0.5\ndegree Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A purely unconstrained SR method can further\nreduce the error of the predicted angles, but produces complex formulas that\nlack physical insight. Then, we implement the same SR-learned inversions in a\nreal-world, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided indoor testbed.\nSABER and unconstrained SR models accurately recover the true AoA with\nnear-zero error. Finally, we benchmark SABER against the Cram\\'er-Rao Lower\nBounds (CRLBs). Our results demonstrate that SABER is an interpretable and\naccurate alternative to state-of-the-art and black-box ML-based methods for AoA\nestimation."}
