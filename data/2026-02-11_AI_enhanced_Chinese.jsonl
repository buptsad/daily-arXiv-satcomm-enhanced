Yet their quantitative effect on transient energy exchange and subsystem performance is not well characterised. We study a conservative mechanical system with constant skew-symmetric velocity coupling. Its dynamics are integrable and evolve on invariant two-tori, whose projections onto subsystem phase planes provide geometric description of energy exchange. When the ratio of normal-mode frequencies is rational, these projections become closed resonant Lissajous curves, enabling structured analysis of subsystem trajectories. To quantify subsystem behaviour, we introduce the inscribed-radius metric: the radius of the largest origin-centred circle contained in a projected trajectory. This gives a lower bound on attainable subsystem energy and acts as an internal performance measure. We derive resonance conditions and develop an efficient method to compute or certify the inscribed radius without time-domain simulation. Our results show that low-order resonances can strongly restrict energy depletion through phase-locking, whereas high-order resonances recover conservative bounds. These insights lead to an explicit interconnection-shaping design framework for both energy absorption and containment control strategies, while taking responsiveness into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cf\u5316\u9640\u87ba\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5185\u63d2\u534a\u5f84\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65e0\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9636\u5171\u632f\u9650\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u9636\u5171\u632f\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u5b88\u80fd\u91cf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u9640\u87ba\u8026\u5408\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08C-L\uff09\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5bfc\u5165-\u80fd\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\uff08IDA-PBC\uff09\u4e2d\u8d77\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u77ac\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4fdd\u5b88\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5e38\u6570\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u901f\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u5728\u6781\u70b9\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u83b7\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5185\u63d2\u534a\u5f84\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5171\u632f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u65f6\u57df\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0e\u5224\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4f4e\u9636\u5171\u632f\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u505c\u6ede\uff1b\u9ad8\u9636\u5171\u632f\u65f6\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u80fd\u91cf\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5185\u63d2\u534a\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u5438\u6536\u4e0e\u5c01\u5b58\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5f15\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u9640\u87ba\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u77ac\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u63d2\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u8d8b\u540c\u89e3\u5256\uff1b\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4e\u9636\u5171\u632f\u4e0b\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u9636\u9ad8\u5171\u632f\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u5b88\u754c\u9650\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u5438\u6536\u4e0e\u5c01\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Passivity is an attractive property because it guarantees stability under feedback and network interconnections; however, strict passivity rarely holds for practical controllers such as Grid Forming Inverters (GFMs) employing P-Q droop. This paper extends the passivity condition by constructing a dynamic, frequency-dependent multiplier that enables PnP stability certification of each component based solely on its admittance, without requiring any modification to the controller design. The multiplier is parameterised as a linear filter whose coefficients are tuned under a passivity goal. Numerical results for practical droop gains confirm the PnP rules, substantially enlarging the certified stability region while preserving the decentralised, model-agnostic nature of passivity-based PnP tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Providing such guarantees is difficult in practice because clock synchronization is inherently imperfect: events generated at different clients within a short time window may carry timestamps that cannot be reliably ordered. Rather than attempting to eliminate synchronization error, we embrace it and establish a probabilistically fair sequencing process. Tommy is a sequencer that uses a statistical model of per-clock synchronization error to compare noisy timestamps probabilistically. Although this enables ordering of two events, the probabilistic comparator is intransitive, making global ordering non-trivial. We address this challenge by mapping the sequencing problem to a classical ranking problem from social choice theory, which offers principled mechanisms for reasoning with intransitive comparisons.

To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies.

Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.\n  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms.

By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies.

Prior attempts to augment CHERI with temporal safety fall short in terms of scalability, memory overhead, and incomplete security guarantees due to periodical sweeps of the system's memory to individually revoke stale capabilities. We address these limitations by introducing colored capabilities that add a controlled form of indirection to CHERI's capability model. This enables provenance tracking of capabilities to their respective allocations via a hardware-managed provenance-validity table, allowing bulk retraction of dangling pointers without needing to quarantine freed memory. Colored capabilities significantly reduce the frequency of capability revocation sweeps while improving security. We realize colored capabilities in PICASSO, an extension of the CHERI-RISC-V architecture on a speculative out-of-order FPGA softcore (CHERI-Toooba). We also integrate colored-capability support into the CheriBSD OS and CHERI-enabled Clang/LLVM toolchain. Our evaluation shows effective mitigation of use-after-free and double-free bugs across all heap-based temporal memory-safety vulnerabilities in NIST Juliet test cases, with only a small performance overhead on SPEC CPU benchmarks (5% g.m.), less latency, and more consistent performance in long-running SQLite, PostgreSQL, and gRPC workloads compared to prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations.

Machine learning (ML)-based localization using channel state information (CSI) is one of the most popular methods for achieving high-accuracy localization with low cost. However, to be accurate and robust, ML-based algorithms need to be trained and tested with large amounts of data, covering not only many user equipment (UE)/target locations, but also many different access points (APs) locations to which the UEs connect, in a variety of different environment types. This paper presents a massive-sized CSI dataset, WiLoc (Wi-Fi Localization), and makes it publicly available. WiLoc is obtained by a series of precision measurement campaigns that span three months, and it is massive in all the above-mentioned three dimensions: > 12 million UE locations, > 3,000 APs, covering 16 buildings for indoor localization, and > 30 streets for outdoor use. The paper describes the dataset structure, measurement environments, measurement protocols, and the dataset validations.

We model SA as a discrete-state Markov chain and first derive a closed-form expression for the expected time to escape a single linear basin in a one-dimensional landscape. We show that this expression also accurately predicts the behavior of continuous-state searches up to a constant scaling factor, which we analyze empirically and explain via variance matching, demonstrating convergence to a factor of sqrt(3) in certain regimes.\n  We then extend the analysis to a two-basin landscape containing a local and a global optimum, obtaining exact expressions for the expected time to reach the global optimum starting from the local optimum, as a function of basin geometry, neighborhood radius, and temperature.

Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.\n  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "XLB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06L7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u653e\u5165\u5185\u6838\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eeBPF\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dL7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u9700\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fa7\u8f66\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528eBPF\u5728\u5185\u6838\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u6838\u5fc3\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5957\u63a5\u5b57\u5c42\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5957eBPF\u6620\u5c04\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u63a5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2a\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0b\uff0cXLB\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eIstio\u548cCilium\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe1.5\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e60%\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "XLB\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5185\u6838\u7684socket\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0L7\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4fa7\u8f66\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Machine learning relies on randomness as a fundamental component in various steps such as data sampling, data augmentation, weight initialization, and optimization. Most machine learning frameworks use pseudorandom number generators as the source of randomness. However, variations in design choices and implementations across different frameworks, software dependencies, and hardware backends along with the lack of statistical validation can lead to previously unexplored attack vectors on machine learning systems. Such attacks on randomness sources can be extremely covert, and have a history of exploitation in real-world systems. In this work, we examine the role of randomness in the machine learning development pipeline from an adversarial point of view, and analyze the implementations of PRNGs in major machine learning frameworks. We present RNGGuard to help machine learning engineers secure their systems with low effort. RNGGuard statically analyzes a target library's source code and identifies instances of random functions and modules that use them. At runtime, RNGGuard enforces secure execution of random functions by replacing insecure function calls with RNGGuard's implementations that meet security specifications.

However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity.

The FTS-PE is a full-state observer for the pose (position and orientation) and velocities and is obtained through a Lyapunov analysis that shows its stability in finite time and its robustness to bounded measurement noise. Further, this observer is designed directly on the state space, the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions, SE(3), without using local coordinates or (dual) quaternion representations. Therefore, it can estimate arbitrary rigid body motions without encountering singularities or the unwinding phenomenon and be readily applied to autonomous vehicles. A version of this observer that does not need translational velocity measurements and uses only point clouds and angular velocity measurements from rate gyros, is also obtained. It is discretized using the framework of geometric mechanics for numerical and experimental implementations. The numerical simulations compare the FTS-PE with a dual-quaternion extended Kalman filter and our previously developed variational pose estimator (VPE). The experimental results are obtained using point cloud images and rate gyro measurements obtained from a Zed 2i stereo depth camera sensor.

While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

PatientTPP representations support downstream prediction tasks, including classification of obesity-associated outcomes in low-risk individuals, even for events not explicitly modeled during training.

Particularly, leveraging LEO satellites and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), ISTNs offer promising solutions but face significant challenges due to diverse terrestrial environments, user and satellite mobility, and long propagation LEO-to-ground distance. To address these challenges, digitial-twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to offer virtual replicas of real-world systems, facilitating prediction for resource management. In this work, we study a time-window-based DT-aided DSS framework for ISTNs, enabling joint long-term and short-term resource decisions to reduce system congestion. Based on that, two optimization problems are formulated, which aim to optimize resource management using DT information and to refine obtained solutions with actual real-time information, respectively. To efficiently solve these problems, we proposed algorithms using compressed-sensing-based and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results using actual traffic data and the London 3D map demonstrate the superiority in terms of congestion minimization of our proposed algorithms compared to benchmarks.

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles", "summary": "The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior.

Meanwhile, modern planters, sprayers, and Virtual Terminals are already constrained by the bus bandwidth. This paper presents ISO FastLane, a gateway-less dual-stack approach that routes point-to-point ISOBUS traffic over Ethernet while keeping broadcast messages on the existing CAN bus. The solution requires no new state machines, no middleware, and no changes to application layer code: only a simple Layer~3 routing decision and a lightweight peer discovery mechanism called Augmented Address Claim (AACL). Legacy devices continue to operate unmodified and unaware of FastLane traffic. Preliminary tests reported on the paper demonstrate that ISO FastLane accelerates Virtual Terminal object pool uploads by factor of 8 and sustains Task Controller message rates over 100 times beyond the current specification limit. Because ISO FastLane builds entirely on existing J1939 and ISO~11783 conventions, it can be implemented by ISOBUS engineers in a matter of weeks.

We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available.

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology", "summary": "Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena.

It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats.

In order to characterize the effect of mobility and Doppler shift in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, we performed BER comparisons over four different NTN tapped-delay-line (TDL) models, TDL-A, TDL-B, TDL-C, and TDL-D, as specified in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) technical report TR 38.811. After channel equalization, a minimum mean squared error with successive detection (MMSE-SD) algorithm was used to enhance the BER performance. It was found that AFDM and OTFS consistently outperformed OCDM across all TDL models, while AFDM performed better than OTFS in TDL-B and TDL-C, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

Building walls introduce considerable attenuation on the radar signals. When the transmitted power is raised to compensate the through-wall attenuation, the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver can saturate the receiver because of which weaker reflections off the target may remain undetected. In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas.

These MDS matrices are very important in cryptography and coding theory because they provide strong data protection and help spread information efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a new type of matrix called a \\emph{consta-$g$-circulant matrix}, which extends the idea of $g$-circulant matrices. These matrices come from a linear transformation defined by the polynomial\n  $\n  h(x) = x^m - \u03bb+ \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} h_i x^i\n  $\n  over $ \\mathbb{F}_q $. We find the upper bound of such matrices exist and give conditions to check when they are invertible. This helps us know when they are MDS matrices.

We give a near-exact privacy analysis using Monte Carlo accounting, based on a dynamic program that leverages the Markovian structure in the subsampling procedure. We show that $b$-min-sep matches cyclic Poisson subsampling in the high noise regime and achieves strictly better guarantees in the mid-to-low noise regime, with experimental results that bolster our claims.

However, deploying separate radars and communication devices involves the allocation of individual frequency bands and hardware platforms. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a robust solution to the challenges of spectral congestion by utilizing a shared waveform, hardware, and spectrum for both localization of mobile users and communication. Various waveforms, including phase-modulated continuous waves (PMCW) and frequency-modulated continuous waves (FMCW), have been explored for target localization using traditional radar. On the other hand, new protocols such as the IEEE 802.11ad have been proposed to support wideband communication between vehicles. This paper compares both traditional radar and communication candidate waveforms for ISAC to detect single-point and extended targets. We show that the response of FMCW to mobile targets is poorer than that of PMCW. However, the IEEE 802.11ad radar outperforms PMCW radar and FMCW radar. Additionally, the radar signal processing algorithms are implemented on Zynq system-on-chip through hardware-software co-design and fixed-point analysis to evaluate their computational complexity in real-world implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83 PMCW\u3001FMCW \u4e0e IEEE 802.11ad \u96f7\u8fbe\u5728 ISAC \u4e2d\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 IEEE 802.11ad \u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5e76\u5728 Zynq SoC \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u2011\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u9891\u8c31\u3001\u540c\u4e00\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u5907\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u8c31\u62e5\u6324\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5019\u9009\u6ce2\u5f62\uff08PMCW\u3001FMCW \u4e0e IEEE 802.11ad\uff09\u5728 ISAC \u4e2d\u5bf9\u5355\u70b9\u53ca\u6269\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 Zynq SoC \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u2011\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "FMCW \u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u54cd\u5e94\u8f83\u5dee\uff1bPMCW \u4e0e IEEE 802.11ad \u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e FMCW\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d IEEE 802.11ad \u96f7\u8fbe\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e Zynq SoC \u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u2011\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "IEEE 802.11ad \u57fa\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5355\u70b9\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf PMCW \u4e0e FMCW \u96f7\u8fbe\uff0c\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728 Zynq SoC \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This project proposes a community-centered, open-access framework to enhance the resilience and reliability of urban power and gas networks by integrating microgrid partitioning, mobile energy storage deployment, and data-driven risk assessment. The approach involves converting passive distribution networks into active, self-healing microgrids using distributed energy resources and remotely controlled switches to enable flexible reconfiguration during normal and emergency operations. To address uncertainties from intermittent renewable generation and variable load, an adjustable interval optimization method combined with a column and constraint generation algorithm is developed, providing robust planning solutions without requiring probabilistic information. Additionally, a real-time online risk assessment tool is proposed, leveraging 25 multi-dimensional indices including load, grid status, resilient resources, emergency response, and meteorological factors to support operational decision-making during extreme events. The framework also optimizes the long-term sizing and allocation of mobile energy storage units while incorporating urban traffic data for effective routing during emergencies. Finally, a novel time-dependent resilience and reliability index is introduced to quantify system performance under diverse operating conditions. The proposed methodology aims to enable resilient, efficient, and adaptable urban energy networks capable of withstanding high-impact disruptions while maximizing operational and economic benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \\emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \\emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare. We further show that this scaling is tight in a weak-screening limit, and that in the sparse-verification regime ($B \\ll K$), substantial leverage requires heavy-tailed score distributions; for light-tailed scores the amplification is only logarithmic.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Governance is essential to ensure that large-scale compute infrastructure is not silently repurposed for training models, circumventing usage policies, or operating outside legal oversight. Because current GPUs expose limited trusted telemetry and can be modified or virtualized by adversaries, we explore whether compute-based measurements can provide actionable signals of utilization when host and device are untrusted. We introduce a measurement framework that leverages architectural characteristics of modern GPUs to generate timing- and memory-based observables that correlate with compute activity. Our design draws on four complementary primitives: (1) a probabilistic, workload-driven mechanism inspired by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to expose parallel effort, (2) sequential, latency-sensitive workloads derived via Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) to characterize scalar execution pressure, (3) General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based tensor-core measurements that reflect dense linear-algebra throughput, and (4) a VRAM-residency test that distinguishes on-device memory locality from off-chip access through bandwidth-dependent hashing. These primitives provide statistical and behavioral indicators of GPU engagement that remain observable even without trusted firmware, enclaves, or vendor-controlled counters. We evaluate their responses to contention, architectural alignment, memory pressure, and power overhead, showing that timing shifts and residency latencies reveal meaningful utilization patterns. Our results illustrate why compute-based telemetry can complement future accountability mechanisms by exposing architectural signals relevant to post-deployment GPU governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cdGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u9a7b\u7559\u4f30\u8ba1GPU\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u9065\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "GPU-accelerated computing\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dGPU\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u9065\u6d4b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9690\u853d\u5730\u8f6c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u89c4\u907f\u4f7f\u7528\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u9003\u79bb\u6cd5\u5f8b\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u5957\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u7c7b\u4e92\u8865\u539f\u8bed\uff1a1\uff09\u7c7b\u4f3cPoW\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51fd\u6570(VDF)\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eGEMM\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b4\uff09\u5229\u7528VRAM\u9a7b\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u533a\u5206\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u548c\u529f\u8017\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u65f6\u5e8f\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u9a7b\u7559\u5ef6\u8fdf\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u5f81GPU\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u4fe1\u56fa\u4ef6\u6216\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u9065\u6d4b\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u5145\u672a\u6765\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3aGPU\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

However, efficiently deploying UAV-BSs to satisfy heterogeneous user distributions remains a challenging optimization problem. While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \\log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO).

However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\\&F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria.

Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability.

Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software.

To illustrate the role and impact of AI in wireless communications, this paper takes collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive and intelligent wireless networks as a representative application and surveys recent advances from an AI perspective. We first introduce the fundamentals of CSS, including the general framework, classical detector design, and fusion strategies. Then, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art research on AI-driven CSS, classified into three categories: discriminative deep learning (DL) models, generative DL models, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, we explore semantic communication (SemCom) as a promising solution for CSS, in which task-oriented representations are exchanged to reduce reporting overhead while preserving decision-critical information.

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems.

To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning based framework that leverages position-aware features to improve beam prediction accuracy while reducing training costs. The proposed approach uses spatial coordinate labels to supervise a position extraction branch and integrates the resulting representations with beam-domain features through a feature fusion module. A dual-branch RegNet architecture is adopted to jointly learn location related and communication features for beam prediction. Two fusion strategies, namely adaptive fusion and adversarial fusion, are introduced to enable efficient feature integration. The proposed framework is evaluated on datasets generated by the DeepMIMO simulator across four urban scenarios at 3.5 GHz following 3GPP specifications, where both reference signal received power and user equipment location information are available.

We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.\n  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.\n  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u533a\u57df\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f53\u79efKD\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6811\u96c6\u5408\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6811\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6811\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d85\u68af\u5f62\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u8fd1\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f53\u79efKD\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\u7684\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u9884\u5904\u7406\u540e\u5e73\u5747\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6811\u96c6\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

This interest arises from its central role in developing vulnerability detection systems, copyright infringement analysis, and malware phylogeny tools. Nearly all binary function similarity systems embed assembly functions into real-valued vectors, where similar functions map to points that lie close to each other in the metric space. These embeddings enable function search: a query function is embedded and compared against a database of candidate embeddings to retrieve the most similar matches.\n  Despite their effectiveness, such systems rely on bi-encoder architectures that embed functions independently, limiting their ability to capture cross-function relationships and similarities. To address this limitation, we introduce ReSIM, a novel and enhanced function search system that complements embedding-based search with a neural re-ranker. Unlike traditional embedding models, our reranking module jointly processes query-candidate pairs to compute ranking scores based on their mutual representation, allowing for more accurate similarity assessment. By re-ranking the top results from embedding-based retrieval, ReSIM leverages fine-grained relation information that bi-encoders cannot capture.\n  We evaluate ReSIM across seven embedding models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in search effectiveness, with average gains of 21.7% in terms of nDCG and 27.8% in terms of Recall.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReSIM\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684bi-encoder\u67b6\u6784\u53ea\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5173\u8054\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7248\u6743\u548c\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ReSIM\u4f53\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5411encoder\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u7840\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2-\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u76f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u79cdembedding\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReSIM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u574721.7%\u7684nDCG\u63d0\u5347\u548c27.8%\u7684Recall\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ReSIM\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eembedding\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5e73\u5747nDCG\u63d0\u534721.7%\uff0cRecall\u63d0\u534727.8%\u3002"}}

Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniComp\u7edf\u7b79\u8bc4\u6d4b\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5316\u6700\u4f73\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u538b\u7f29\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u5374\u524a\u5f31\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u805a\u7126\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u84b8\u998f\uff1b\u6025\u9700\u6db5\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6UniComp\uff1b\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u572840+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u7559\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u5c06\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea650%\u3002", "conclusion": "UniComp\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6307\u51fa\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u6613\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u6613\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u517c\u987e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u867d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed8\u51fa\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions).

Here, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, which simultaneously reduces his detection error probabilities and degrades the communication performance between Alice and Bob, without relying on either channel state information (CSI) or additional jamming power. However, the introduction of the DRIS renders it intractable for Willie to construct a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, since the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistic is analytically intractable under the Alice-Bob transmission hypothesis. Moreover, given the adversarial relationship between Willie and Alice/Bob, it is unrealistic to assume that Willie has access to a labeled training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised masked autoregressive flow (MAF)-based NP detection framework that exploits prior knowledge inherent in covert communications. We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS.

This worst-case assumption is likely to overestimate the privacy threat faced by an individual in practice. In contrast, Statistical Privacy (SP), as well as related notions such as noiseless privacy or limited background knowledge privacy, describe a setting in which the adversary knows the distribution of the database entries, but not their exact realizations. In this case, privacy analysis must account for the interaction between uncertainty induced by the entropy of the underlying distributions and privacy mechanisms that distort query answers, which can be highly non-trivial.\n  This paper investigates this problem for multiple queries (composition). A privacy mechanism is proposed that is based on subsampling and randomly partitioning the database to bound the dependency among queries. This way for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, upper privacy bounds against limited adversaries are obtained without any further restriction on the database.\n  These bounds show that in realistic application scenarios taking the entropy of distributions into account yields improvements of privacy and precision guarantees. We illustrate examples where for fixed privacy parameters and utility loss SP allows significantly more queries than DP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u53d7\u9650\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u9690\u79c1\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u5212\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u9650\u5236\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u9690\u79c1\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "DP\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u624b\u51e0\u4e4e\u638c\u63e1\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5c11\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u624b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u5931\u771f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6279\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5212\u5206\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u9690\u79c1\u754c\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\u7ea6\u675f\u4f30\u8ba1\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u9690\u79c1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\uff0cSP\u53ef\u5bb9\u7eb3\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4DP\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8003\u8651\u53d7\u9650\u5bf9\u624b\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5212\u5206\u7684\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ea6\u675f\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u9650\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In contrast to upper confidence bound (UCB)-style exploration methods, OWMs incorporate optimism directly into model learning by augmentation with an optimistic dynamics loss that biases imagined transitions toward higher-reward outcomes. This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures.

While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.\n  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.\n  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.\n  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability.

Despite substantial progress, a significant gap remains between existing convergence rates and the state-of-the-art bounds known for federated convex optimization. In this work, we address this limitation by establishing a series of improved convergence rates. First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings.

However, existing TPM-based multi-signature constructions suffer from a fundamental limitation, they require interactive protocols where all participants must coordinate during the commitment phase, before any signature can be computed. This interactive requirement creates several critical problems, such as synchronization bottlenecks, quadratic communication complexity, and aborted protocols as a result of participant failure. These limitations become particularly heightened for applications that require cross-device cryptographic operations. This paper presents PiTPM, an Aggregator Framework built upon Schnorr's digital signature. Our protocol eliminates the interactive requirement using a hybrid trust architecture. The proposed framework uses pre-shared randomness seeds stored securely in an Aggregator, enabling deterministic computation of global commitments without inter-participant communication.

Although methods like low-rank adapters help address these challenges by adding small trainable modules to the frozen LM, they also increase memory usage and do not reduce inference latency. We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss. Empirical results show it outperforms recent finetuning baselines in efficiency and performance. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of this stochastic gating process, and show that our method admits a simpler and better-conditioned optimization landscape compared to LoRA.

Recent work has explored augmenting SAST with Large Language Models (LLMs), but these approaches typically use LLMs to triage existing tool outputs rather than to reason about vulnerability semantics directly. We introduce QRS (Query, Review, Sanitize), a neuro-symbolic framework that inverts this paradigm. Rather than filtering results from static rules, QRS employs three autonomous agents that generate CodeQL queries from a structured schema definition and few-shot examples, then validate findings through semantic reasoning and automated exploit synthesis. This architecture enables QRS to discover vulnerability classes beyond predefined patterns while substantially reducing false positives. We evaluate QRS on full Python packages rather than isolated snippets. In 20 historical CVEs in popular PyPI libraries, QRS achieves 90.6% detection accuracy. Applied to the 100 most-downloaded PyPI packages, QRS identified 39 medium-to-high-severity vulnerabilities, 5 of which were assigned new CVEs, 5 received documentation updates, while the remaining 29 were independently discovered by concurrent researchers, validating both the severity and discoverability of these findings. QRS accomplishes this with low time overhead and manageable token costs, demonstrating that LLM-driven query synthesis and code review can complement manually curated rule sets and uncover vulnerability patterns that evade existing industry tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Within the retrieved corpus, the main post-2015 shift is from multisig-style, which envisioned oracles as co-signers, toward attestation-based designs, mainly represented by Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which show stronger Bitcoin community compliance, tool support, and evidence of practical implementations in real-world scenarios such as betting and prediction-market mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea 2015 \u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01 Layer\u202f1 oracle \u4ece\u591a\u7b7e\u540d\u8f6c\u5411 DLC \u7b49\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u793e\u533a\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6295\u6ce8\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\uff1b\u4f46\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u539f\u751f\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea 2015 \u5e74\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u65f6\u4ee3\u4ee5\u6765\uff0cBitcoin Layer\u202f1 \u662f\u5426\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684 oracle \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56 Scopus \u4e0e Web\u202fof\u202fScience\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5 Google\u202fScholar \u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7d22\u5f15\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b66\u672f\u8986\u76d6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u591a\u6570\u5728\u671f\u520a\u5916\u6d41\u4f20\uff1b\u4e3b\u6d41\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u7531\u591a\u7b7e\u540d\u7c7b oracle \u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\uff08DLC\uff09\u8fc8\u8fdb\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u793e\u533a\u63a5\u53d7\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6295\u6ce8\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\uff0cBitcoin Layer\u202f1 \u7684 oracle \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ece\u591a\u91cd\u7b7e\u540d\u5f0f\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 DLC\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u793e\u533a\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0b\u6ce8\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u7136\u800c\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5bf9\u6b64\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8d21\u732e\u53d1\u8868\u4e8e\u975e\u671f\u520a\u6e20\u9053\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Spinel, a post-quantum digital signature scheme that combines the proven security of SPHINCS+ (CCS 2019) with a new family of algebraic hash functions (Adv. Math. Commun. 2025) derived from the Tillich-Zemor paradigm (Eurocrypt 2008) with security rooted in the hardness of navigating expander graphs over SL_n(F_p), a problem believed to be hard even for quantum adversaries. We first provide empirical evidence of the security of this hash function, complementing the original theoretical analysis. We then show how the hash function can be integrated within the SPHINCS+ framework to give a secure signature scheme. We then model and analyze the security degradation of the proposed scheme, which informs the parameter selection we discuss next. Finally, we provide an implementation of the hash function and the proposed signature scheme Spinel as well as detailed empirical results for the performance of Spinel showing its feasibility in practice.

RISs, thanks to their intelligent design, can reshape the wireless channel to provide favorable propagation conditions for information transfer. In this work, we experimentally investigate the potential of RISs to enhance the effective rank of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, thereby improving spatial multiplexing capabilities. In our experiment, commodity WiFi transceivers are used, representing a practical MIMO system. In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$.

While CMMC defines assessment objectives and control requirements, limited formal guidance exists regarding evidence sampling, the process by which assessors select, review, and validate artifacts to substantiate compliance. Analyzing data collected through an anonymous survey of CMMC-certified assessors and lead assessors, this exploratory study investigates whether inconsistencies in evidence sampling practices exist within the CMMC assessment ecosystem and evaluates the need for a risk-informed standardized sampling methodology. Across 17 usable survey responses, results indicate that evidence sampling practices are predominantly driven by assessor judgment, perceived risk, and environmental complexity rather than formalized standards, with formal statistical sampling models rarely referenced.

In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off. Finally, online A/B tests demonstrate statistically significant improvements in key ads metrics (including CTR and click-quality measures) and ML-DCN has been deployed in the production system with neutral serving cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pinterest \u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5bb9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa ML-DCN\uff08\u4f4e\u79e9\u4ea4\u53c9+\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8 AUC\u3001\u826f\u597d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5e76\u5df2\u4e0a\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e7f\u544a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e2\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53c8\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5ef6\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u4ea4\u53c9\u5c42\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6761\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u517c\u987e DCNv2 \u4e0e MaskNet \u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5f62\u6210 ML-DCN\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Pinterest \u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cML-DCN \u5728\u76f8\u540c FLOPs \u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8 AUC\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5176 AUC-FLOPs \u5e73\u8861\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u7ebf\u4e0a A/B \u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a CTR \u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ML-DCN \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c FLOPs \u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4 DCNv2\u3001MaskNet \u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684 AUC\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u589e\u91cf\u65f6\u7684 AUC-FLOPs \u5747\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u5230 Pinterest \u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Understanding how individual features influence model outcomes is crucial for building interpretable and equitable models. While feature importance metrics for accuracy are well-established, methods for assessing feature contributions to fairness remain underexplored. We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training. Second, we evaluate the fairness of models trained with and without a given feature. This occlusion-based score enjoys dramatic computational simplification via minipatch learning.

Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our method achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating robustness across multiple datasets, including scenarios with noisy or sparse data, and provides insights into the contributions of individual features to the forecast.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165Embedding Dropout\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u53c2\u6570Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u5bf9\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Embedding Dropout\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5927\u578bTransformer\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.\n  Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy.

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data.

Under review", "summary": "Cosine similarity is prevalent in contrastive learning, yet it makes an implicit assumption: embedding magnitude is noise. Prior work occasionally found dot product and cosine similarity comparable, but left unanswered WHAT information magnitude carries, WHEN it helps, and HOW to leverage it. We conduct a systematic study through a $2 \\times 2$ ablation that independently controls input-side and output-side normalization across text and vision models. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, in text retrieval, output (document) magnitude strongly correlates with relevance (Cohen's $d$ up to 1.80), yielding the largest gains on reasoning-intensive tasks. Second, input and output magnitudes serve asymmetric roles: output magnitude directly scales similarity scores while input magnitude modulates training dynamics. Third, magnitude learning benefits asymmetric tasks (text retrieval, RAG) but harms symmetric tasks (STS, text-image alignment). These findings establish a task symmetry principle: the choice between cosine and dot product depends on whether the task has distinct input roles, enabling cost-free improvements by simply removing an unnecessary constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u81ea\u7531\u9009\u62e9\u4f59\u5f26\u6216\u70b9\u79ef\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5d4c\u5165\u5e45\u503c\u6240\u643a\u5e26\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5176\u4f55\u65f6\u6709\u76ca\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u7b3c\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u70b9\u79ef\u4e0e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5374\u672a\u5256\u6790\u5e45\u503c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c2\u00d72\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u4fa7\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fa7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u6587\u6863\uff09\u5e45\u503c\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08Cohen'd \u6700\u9ad81.80\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\uff1b2\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5e45\u503c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5e45\u503c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f29\u653e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5e45\u503c\u8c03\u8282\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff1b3\uff09\u5e45\u503c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u5374\u5bf9\u540c\u8d28\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u79f0\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u89d2\u8272\u4e0d\u540c\uff08\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\u5d4c\u5165\u5e45\u503c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u70b9\u79ef\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u89d2\u8272\u76f8\u540c\uff08\u5bf9\u79f0\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53bb\u9664\u5e45\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u4e3a\u96f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model.

We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data.

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \\geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \\leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models.

Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification. Across nine node, link, and graph benchmarks, STEM-GNN achieves a stronger three-way balance, improving robustness to degree/homophily shifts and to feature/edge corruptions while remaining competitive on clean graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9759\u6001 GNN \u53d7\u5230\u7a33\u5065\u6027-\u6cdb\u5316\u6298\u8877\u9650\u5236\uff0cSTEM\u2011GNN\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u548cLipschitz\u6b63\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684 GNN \u9700\u8981\u517c\u987e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9759\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u7a81\u7834\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9650\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9/\u8fb9/\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSTEM\u2011GNN \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u5ea6/\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81/\u8fb9\u7834\u574f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "STEM\u2011GNN\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u63a5\u53e3\u548cLipschitz\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b"}}

Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures.

We propose to modify attention into a Laplacian mechanism that gives the model more direct control over token variance. We conjecture that this helps transformers achieve the ideal token geometry. To investigate our conjecture, we first show that incorporating the Laplacian mechanism into transformers induces consistent improvements across benchmarks in computer vision and language. Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u7528Laplacian\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbtoken\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7ftoken\u6620\u5c04\u8d8b\u4e8e\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdtoken\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aLaplacian\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528PCA\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u548cNeural Collapse\u8bc4\u4f30token\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55", "result": "Laplacian\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06token embedding\u91cd\u65b0\u5851\u9020\u4e3a\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7c7b\u5185\u805a\u96c6\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0Neural Collapse\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5730\u63a7\u5236token\u65b9\u5dee\uff0cLaplacian\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u7684token\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347Transformer\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design.

This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation.

Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules.

While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To appear in Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '26)", "summary": "The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660ePPG\u80fd\u5728\u53d1\u4f5c\u524d\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u98ce\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398+ResNet-1D\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u672f\u524d\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e2d\u98ce\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cMC-MED\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f4f\u9662\u4e2d\u98ce\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u75c5\u524dPPG\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u63d0\u53d6\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-1D\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u6bb5\u7684\u4e2d\u98ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u4e0a\uff0c4\u30015\u30016\u5c0f\u65f6\u524d\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.7956\u30010.8759\u30010.9406\uff1b\u5728MC-MED\u4e0a\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u6bb5\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.9256\u30010.9595\u30010.9888\u3002", "conclusion": "PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u53d1\u4f5c\u524d\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5c31\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e2d\u98ce\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u76d1\u62a4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Outlier detection (OD) on tabular data underpins numerous real-world applications, yet existing OD benchmarks remain limited. The prominent OD benchmark AdBench is the de facto standard in the literature, yet comprises only 57 datasets. In addition to other shortcomings discussed in this work, its small scale severely restricts diversity and statistical power. We introduce MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular OD comprising three carefully curated components: OddBench, with 790 datasets containing real-world semantic anomalies; OvrBench, with 856 datasets featuring real-world statistical outliers; and SynBench, with 800 synthetically generated datasets spanning diverse data priors and outlier archetypes. Owing to its scale and diversity, MacrOData enables comprehensive and statistically robust evaluation of tabular OD methods. Our benchmarks further satisfy several key desiderata: We provide standardized train/test splits for all datasets, public/private benchmark partitions with held-out test labels for the latter reserved toward an online leaderboard, and annotate our datasets with semantic metadata. We conduct extensive experiments across all benchmarks, evaluating a broad range of OD methods comprising classical, deep, and foundation models, over diverse hyperparameter configurations. We report detailed empirical findings, practical guidelines, as well as individual performances as references for future research.

The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528LLM\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u7684LLMRule\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u516c\u5e73\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3001\u4e24\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u7b49\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LLMRule\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5165\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u3001\u6ce2\u5170\u548c\u8377\u5170\u7684600\u591a\u9879\u771f\u5b9ePB\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines.

This setting is motivated by language generation tasks, in which a prompt may admit many acceptable completions, but not every completion is acceptable. We study this problem under three feedback models. For each model, we characterize the optimal mistake bound in the realizable setting using an appropriate combinatorial dimension. We then establish a trichotomy of regret bounds across the three models in the agnostic setting.

However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\\!-\\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\\!-\\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This model captures environments that are stable except at a few vulnerable points. We introduce \\emph{conditioned occupancy measures}, which remain stable across episodes even with adversarial transitions, and use them to design two algorithms. The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(H S^\u039b\\sqrt{K S A^{\u039b+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon.

In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules.

Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets.

The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines.

Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees.

We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data.

This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO).

However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u71b5\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RL\u4e2d\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u9759\u6001\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u71b5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba+\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u8981\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u5bf9\u71b5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5347-\u964d\u3001\u964d-\u5347-\u964d\u3001\u632f\u8361\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u7f13\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u71b5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86RL\u4e2d\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace.

However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u538b\u7f29-\u89e3\u7801\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5c11\u5fe0\u5b9e\u91cd\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u9020\u6210\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5f20\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u538b\u7f29-\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u201c\u5927\u5c0f-\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u6096\u8bba\u201d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4ece0.6B\u523090B\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u91cd\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u539f\u59cb\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u5199\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u3002\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u79e9\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fb5\u5165\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u540e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u653e\u5927\u3002\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4fdd\u5b58\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML.

Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support.

Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.\n  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed.

This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available.

On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned.

This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL.

From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAFRL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SFT+RL\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u514b\u670dRL\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u584c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65e2\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53c8\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6210\u529f\u538b\u7f29\u81f30.6B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e2\u9700\u8981\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53c8\u9700\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1AFRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u8bcd\u8f93\u51fa\u786e\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u91c7\u7528SFT+RL\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e73\u8861\u635f\u5931\uff08SFT\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\uff09\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297RL\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u584c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Stepwise\u2011GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u4ee4\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "32B\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u8868\u73b0\uff1b0.6B\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7Answer\u2011First, Reason\u2011Later(AFRL)\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e73\u8861\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5c0632B\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u8fc1\u79fb\u52300.6B\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement. Adopting a task-centric view by considering reasoning tasks with multiple difficulty levels, we further prove quantifiable conditions on model initialization, task difficulty, and sample budget where easy-to-hard curricula provably achieve better guarantees than training on fixed mixtures of tasks.

The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks.

Existing training-data influence estimators such as TracIn yield a single scalar score that aggregates over all loop iterations, obscuring when during the recurrent computation a training example matters. We introduce \\textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$\u03c4$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Patel"], "title": "Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders", "comment": "Technical Report", "summary": "Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ed1\u7bb1\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "CoT\u5e38\u63a9\u76d6\u5185\u90e8\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9884\u8bbe\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e14\u65e0\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u81ea\u8bc4\u8005\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u504f\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5927\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u8d1f\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u91cd\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0e\u65e9\u505c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u5224\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u6b3eLLM\u4e0e\u4e09\u9879\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u8bf8\u5982\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u6d41\u5229\u5ea6\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5199\u4f5c\u6b63\u5f0f\u5ea6\u7b49\u672a\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5df2\u6709\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u7b49\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u65e7\u5df2\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}
