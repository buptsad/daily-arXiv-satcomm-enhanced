Our key insight extends the\nclassical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise\nperturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured\nnoise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise\ndistributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization\neffects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with\nstandard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian\nchannel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,\nshowing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood\n(NLL).

To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,\nand develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that\napproximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise\nsurrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly\nsubstitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function\nconstructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.\nTheoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically\nachieve an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to\nnonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation.

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist).

We study\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a\ntwo-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a\nminimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel\nsimilarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local\ndeviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary\ndetectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in\ncompute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over\nstrong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types\noften imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,\nsuggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments."}

In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform\nvertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies\nuniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity\nparameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is\nthe characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which\nprovides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM\nand DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional\nedge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity\ncoefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity\ncaptured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity\npatterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge\ndensities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected\nadjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of\nclusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors\nmay fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments\non both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms\nincorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches."}

For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling\nacross undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can\nguard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between\nequivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model\ncalibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and\nregression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is\nnatural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the\nrelationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we\npresent a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving\nlower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under\nvarious equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of\nequivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in\nmiscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our\ntheoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship\nbetween equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated\ndatasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties."}

To address these limitations, this study\nexplores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale\napplications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be\nanalyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying\ndynamics.\n  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two\nsingle-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection.

A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly\nalarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,\nwithout requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial\nand vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass\nindustry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and\nMicrosoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are\nfar easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering\nthe barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core\nresearch questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors\nreliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and\n(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection\nwithout overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators\nsuch as SpeechT5.\n  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic\nevaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail\nunder both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted\nfine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding\nsignificant accuracy improvements.

This paper introduces\nTURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop\nexisting platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1)\nfrom test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final\nthroughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to\ndecide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop.
