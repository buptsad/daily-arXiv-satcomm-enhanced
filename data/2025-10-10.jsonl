Our approach establishes\nN-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and\nmodified double auctions.

Second, these\ncontracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions.

Coarse-grained\nsnapshot rollbacks cause unacceptable data loss for legitimate users.\nSurgically removing an attack's impact is hindered by a fundamental challenge\nin high-concurrency environments: it is difficult to attribute resulting file\nand database modifications to a specific attack-related request. We present\nANCORA, a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications without\ninvasive instrumentation. ANCORA first isolates the full sequence of syscalls\ntriggered by a single malicious request. Based on this sequence, ANCORA\naddresses file and database modifications separately. To trace file changes, it\nbuilds a provenance graph that reveals all modifications, including those by\nexploit-spawned processes.

To plan a safe trajectory in the presence of moving space\ndebris, an integrated approach of artificial potential field and sliding mode\ncontroller is proposed and implemented in this paper. The relative 6-DOF\nkinematics and dynamics of the spacecraft is modelled in the framework of\ngeometric mechanics with the relative configuration expressed through\nexponential coordinates. Various collision avoidance guidance algorithms have\nbeen proposed in the literature but the Artificial Potential Field guidance\nalgorithm is computationally efficient and enables real-time path adjustments\nto avoid collision with obstacles. However, it is prone to issues such as local\nminima. In literature, local minima issue is typically avoided by either\nredefining the potential function such as adding vorticity or by employing\nsearch techniques which are computationally expensive. To address these\nchallenges, a physics-informed APF is proposed in this paper where Hamiltonian\nmechanics is used instead of the traditional Newtonian mechanics-based\napproach. In this approach, instead of relying on attractive and repulsive\nforces for path planning, the Hamiltonian approach uses the potential field to\ndefine a path of minimum potential. Additionally, to track the desired\ntrajectory planned by the guidance algorithm within a fixed-time frame, a\nnon-singular fixed-time sliding mode controller (FTSMC) is used. The proposed\nfixed-time sliding surface not only ensures fixed-time convergence of system\nstates but also guarantees the global stability of the closed-loop system\nwithout singularity. The simulation results presented support the claims made."}

Unintended Risk Interactions Induced by LLM Defenses", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various\napplications, but their deployment in sensitive domains raises significant\nconcerns. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been\nproposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation,\noverlooking their broader impacts across other risk dimensions. In this work,\nwe take the first step in investigating unintended interactions caused by\ndefenses in LLMs, focusing on the complex interplay between safety, fairness,\nand privacy. Specifically, we propose CrossRiskEval, a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to assess whether deploying a defense targeting one risk\ninadvertently affects others. Through extensive empirical studies on 14\ndefense-deployed LLMs, covering 12 distinct defense strategies, we reveal\nseveral alarming side effects: 1) safety defenses may suppress direct responses\nto sensitive queries related to bias or privacy, yet still amplify indirect\nprivacy leakage or biased outputs; 2) fairness defenses increase the risk of\nmisuse and privacy leakage; 3) privacy defenses often impair safety and\nexacerbate bias. We further conduct a fine-grained neuron-level analysis to\nuncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Our analysis reveals the\nexistence of conflict-entangled neurons in LLMs that exhibit opposing\nsensitivities across multiple risk dimensions. Further trend consistency\nanalysis at both task and neuron levels confirms that these neurons play a key\nrole in mediating the emergence of unintended behaviors following defense\ndeployment. We call for a paradigm shift in LLM risk evaluation, toward\nholistic, interaction-aware assessment of defense strategies."}

In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor\nattacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\\ Vector\\\n(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned\nbackdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into\nattacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their\nsimilarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that\nenhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\\ Backdoor\\ Vector\\\n(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one.

To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform}\n(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping\nthe sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the\n\\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of\nthe eigenvalues of loss Hessian.

To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization.

However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)\nfine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable\nlikelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level\nlikelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this\napproach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in\nsequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a\nsurrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods\nhave seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood\nevaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its\nsources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through\nfast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{Group Diffusion Policy\nOptimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages\nsimple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the\nvariance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo\nsampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation\nbudgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained\ncheckpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,\non the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks."}

However, linearity is defined\nrelative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\\to$$Y$. Is it possible to\nidentify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally\nnonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that\nmakes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich\na linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A\ng_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly\ndefined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this\nkind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of\nlinear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,\napplicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of\ntwo Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage\nthis property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our\narchitecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.\nWe further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)\non networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to\ndemonstrate modular style transfer."}

This study investigates emerging machine\nlearning models and training strategies to improve AI-based intrusion detection\nsystems (IDS) for ADS-B. Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two\ndeep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the\nother an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first\nxLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving\npre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data\ncontaining instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach\noutperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that\nprogressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an\nF1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on\nunseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model.\nInference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the\nxLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh\ninterval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations.\nWhile the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at\nthe cost of lower detection performance."}
