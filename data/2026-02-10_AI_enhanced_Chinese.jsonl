Due to the nature of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications, black-box defenses are more practical than white-box methods, yet existing purification techniques suffer from key limitations: a lack of justification for specific transformations, dataset dependency, high computational overhead, and a neglect of frequency-domain transformations. This paper conducts a preliminary study on various image transformations, identifying down-upscaling as the most effective backdoor trigger disruption technique. We subsequently propose \\texttt{Lite-BD}, a lightweight two-stage blackbox backdoor defense. \\texttt{Lite-BD} first employs a super-resolution-based down-upscaling stage to neutralize spatial triggers. A secondary stage utilizes query-based band-by-band frequency filtering to remove triggers hidden in specific bands.

However, this signal-level fidelity-oriented design often incurs high communication overhead and system complexity, particularly in video communication scenarios where mainstream frameworks rely on transmitting visual data itself, resulting in significant bandwidth consumption. To address this issue, we propose a visual data-free communication framework, Mirage, for extremely efficient video transmission while preserving semantic information. Mirage decomposes video content into two complementary components: temporal sequence information capturing motion dynamics and spatial appearance representations describing overall visual structure. Temporal information is preserved through video captioning, while key frames are encoded into compact semantic representations for spatial appearance. These representations are transmitted to the receiver, where videos are synthesized using generative video models. Since no raw visual data is transmitted, Mirage is inherently privacy-preserving. Mirage also supports personalized adaptation across deployment scenarios. The sender, network, and receiver can independently impose constraints on semantic representation, transmission, and generation, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency, privacy, control, and perceptual quality. Experimental results in video transmission demonstrate that Mirage achieves up to a 50000X data-level compression speedup over raw video transmission, with gains expected to scale with larger video content sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mirage\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f/\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u9012\u8bed\u4e49\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe50,000\u500d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMirage\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4fdd\u6301\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5916\u89c2\uff08\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMirage\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe50000\u500d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u53ef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "Mirage\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u9690\u79c1-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, a fundamental architectural constraint, that only a limited number of hardware events can be monitored concurrently, creates a significant bottleneck, leading to detection blind spots. Prior work has primarily focused on optimizing machine learning models for a single, statically chosen event set, or on ensembling models over the same feature set. We argue that robustness requires diversifying not only the models, but also the underlying feature sets (i.e., the monitored hardware events) in order to capture a broader spectrum of program behavior. This observation motivates the following research question: Can detection performance be improved by trading temporal granularity for broader coverage, via the strategic scheduling of different feature sets over time? To answer this question, we propose Hydra, a novel detection mechanism that partitions execution traces into time slices and learns an effective schedule of feature sets and corresponding classifiers for deployment. By cycling through complementary feature sets, Hydra mitigates the limitations of a fixed monitoring perspective. Our experimental evaluation shows that Hydra significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-feature-set baselines, achieving a 19.32% improvement in F1 score and a 60.23% reduction in false positive rate. These results underscore the importance of feature-set diversity and establish strategic multi-feature-set scheduling as an effective principle for robust, hardware-assisted malware detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing topology designs often assume idealized conditions and do not account for real-world deployment dynamics, such as partial constellation deployment, daily node turnovers, and varying link availability, making them inapplicable to real LEO networks. In this paper, we develop two topology design methods that explicitly operate under real-world deployment constraints: the Long--Short Links (LSL) method, which systematically combines long-distance shortcut links with short-distance local links, and the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, which constructs topologies via stochastic optimization. Evaluated under both full deployment and partial deployment scenarios using 3-months of Starlink data, our methods achieve up to 45% lower average end-to-end delay, 65% fewer hops, and up to $2.3\\times$ higher network capacity compared to +Grid. Both methods are designed to handle daily node turnovers by incrementally updating the topology, maintaining good network performance while avoiding costly full reconstruction of the topology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Input-constrained control barrier functions (ICCBFs) provide a framework for safety certification under bounded actuation; however, conventional ICCBF formulations can be overly conservative and exhibit limited robustness to uncertainty, leading to high fuel consumption and reduced mission feasibility. This paper proposes a framework in which the full hierarchy of class-$\\mathcal{K}$ functions defining the ICCBF recursion is parameterized and learned, enabling localized shaping of the safe set and reduced conservatism. A control margin is computed efficiently using differential algebra to enable the learned continuous-time ICCBFs to be implemented on time-sampled dynamical systems typical of spacecraft proximity operations. A meta-reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train a policy that generates ICCBF parameters over a distribution of hidden physical parameters and uncertainties, using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Simulation results on cruise control, spacecraft inspection, and docking scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains safety while reducing fuel consumption and improving feasibility relative to fixed class-$\\mathcal{K}$ ICCBFs, with the RNN showing a particularly strong advantage in the more complex inspection case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684 ICCBF \u4e0e\u5143\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f4e\u71c3\u6599\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u822a\u5929\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0e\u5bf9\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf ICCBF \u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u63a8\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u71c3\u6599\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f4e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c40\u90e8\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 ICCBF \u9012\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u6574\u4e2a class-\ud835\udca6 \u51fd\u6570\u9636\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u4ee3\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u88d5\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4 ICCBF \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5143\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 MLP \u4e0e RNN \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210 ICCBF \u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de1\u822a\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u822a\u5929\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0e\u5bf9\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u71c3\u6599\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff1bRNN \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u590d\u6742\u68c0\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u9636 class-\ud835\udca6 \u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684 ICCBF \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u63a8\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u71c3\u6599\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cRNN \u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002"}}

However, the rapid growth of terrestrial devices intensifies spectrum sharing between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments, resulting in severe cross-tier interference. In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed DDPG framework optimizes the HAPS beamforming weights to form spatial nulls toward interference sources while maintaining robust links to the desired signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG framework consistently outperforms conventional ZF beamforming among different RIS configurations, achieving up to \\(11.3\\%\\) throughput improvement for a \\(4\\times4\\) RIS configuration, validating its adaptive capability to enhance spectral efficiency in dynamic HAPS-based SAGINs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As AVs operate in safety-critical environments, understanding their robustness in an adversarial environment is an important research problem. Prior physical adversarial attacks on vision-based autonomous vehicles predominantly target immediate safety failures (e.g., a crash, a traffic-rule violation, or a transient lane departure) by inducing a short-lived perception or control error. This paper shows a qualitatively different risk: a long-horizon route integrity compromise, where an attacker gradually steers a victim AV away from its intended route and into an attacker-chosen destination while the victim continues to drive \"normally.\" This will not pose a danger to the victim vehicle itself, but also to potential passengers sitting inside the vehicle.\n  In this paper, we design and implement the first adversarial framework, called JackZebra, that performs route-level hijacking of a vision-based end-to-end driving stack using a physically plausible attacker vehicle with a reconfigurable display mounted on the rear. The central challenge is temporal persistence: adversarial influence must remain effective in changing viewpoints, lighting, weather, traffic, and the victim's continual replanning -- without triggering conspicuous failures. Our key insight is to treat route hijacking as a closed-loop control problem and to convert adversarial patches into steering primitives that can be selected online via an interactive adjustment loop. Our adversarial patches are also carefully designed against worst-case background and sensor variations so that the adversarial impacts on the victim. Our evaluation shows that JackZebra can successfully hijack victim vehicles to deviate from original routes and stop at adversarial destinations with a high success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "JackZebra\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u9a7e\u8f66\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u52ab\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f80\u5f80\u5173\u6ce8\u5373\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u8def\u7ebf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u4e0d\u89e6\u53d1\u660e\u663e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u9a7e\u8f66\u5b9e\u65bd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8def\u7531\u52ab\u6301\u3002", "method": "JackZebra\u5c06\u8def\u7531\u52ab\u6301\u89c6\u4e3a\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u7b49\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u540e\u7f6e\u663e\u793a\u88c5\u7f6e\u6295\u5c04\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5faa\u73af\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cJackZebra\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u8def\u7531\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u53d7\u5bb3\u8f66\u8f86\u504f\u79bb\u539f\u59cb\u8def\u7ebf\u5e76\u505c\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86JackZebra\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u7531\u7ea7\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u53d7\u5bb3\u8f66\u8f86\u5f15\u79bb\u539f\u59cb\u8def\u7ebf\u5e76\u9a76\u5411\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u3002"}}

We propose an LLM-aided SINDy pipeline that iteratively refines candidate equations using a large language model (LLM) in the loop through in-context learning. The pipeline begins with a baseline SINDy model fit using an adaptive library and then enters a LLM-guided refinement cycle. At each iteration, the current best equations, error metrics, and domain-specific constraints are summarized in a prompt to the LLM, which suggests new equation structures. These candidate equations are parsed against a defined symbolic form and evaluated on training and test data. The pipeline uses simulation-based error as a primary metric, but also assesses structural similarity to ground truth, including matching functional forms, key terms, couplings, qualitative behavior. An iterative stopping criterion ends refinement early if test error falls below a threshold (NRMSE < 0.1) or if a maximum of 10 iterations is reached. Finally, the best model is selected, and we evaluate this LLM-aided SINDy on 63 dynamical system datasets (ODEBench) and march leuba model for boiling nuclear reactor. The results are compared against classical SINDy and show the LLM-loop consistently improves symbolic recovery with higher equation similarity to ground truth and lower test RMSE than baseline SINDy for cases with complex dynamics. This work demonstrates that an LLM can effectively guide SINDy's search through equation space, integrating data-driven error feedback with domain-inspired symbolic reasoning to discover governing equations that are not only accurate but also structurally interpretable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684SINDy\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSINDy\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SINDy\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e72\u9884\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6062\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e93\u62df\u5408\u57fa\u7840SINDy\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u5165LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u6c47\u603b\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u4ea4\u7ed9LLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u82e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8eNRMSE 0.1\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u8fbe\u523010\u6b21\u5373\u505c\u6b62\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572863\u4e2aODEBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u51b7\u5374\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLLM-aided SINDy\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edfSINDy\u5728\u6240\u6709\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5RMSE\uff1b\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b26\u53f7\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SINDy\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e93\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u652f\u914d\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, there is no systematic study on their effectiveness in autonomously reproducing Linux kernel vulnerabilities with concrete proofs-of-concept (PoCs). Owing to the size, complexity, and low-level nature of the Linux kernel, such tasks are widely regarded as particularly challenging for current LLM-based approaches.\n  In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of LLM-based Linux kernel vulnerability reproduction. For this purpose, we develop K-Repro, an LLM-based agentic system equipped with controlled code-browsing, virtual machine management, interaction, and debugging capabilities. Using kernel security patches as input, K-Repro automates end-to-end bug reproduction of N-day vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. On a dataset of 100 real-world exploitable Linux kernel vulnerabilities collected from KernelCTF, our results show that K-Repro can generate PoCs that reproduce over 50\\% of the cases with practical time and monetary cost.\n  Beyond aggregate success rates, we perform an extensive study of effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and impact factors to explain when agentic reproduction succeeds, where it fails, and which components drive performance. These findings provide actionable guidance for building more reliable autonomous security agents and for assessing real-world N-day risk from both offensive and defensive perspectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e Riemannian \u6269\u6563\u7684\u591a RIS \u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 SINR\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u591a RIS \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a RIS \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bb9\u6613\u653e\u5927\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14 LOS \u91cd\u53e0\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301 SINR\u3002", "method": "1) LSTM \u7ed3\u5408\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u822a\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u7528\u6237\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2) Riemannian \u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5706\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u672a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u7684 RIS \u5f00/\u5173\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u3001RIS \u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 30% SINR\uff0c\u6bd4\u59cb\u7ec8\u5f00\u542f\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 44%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7 LSTM \u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001Riemannian \u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u4f4d\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u901f\u7387\u7684 ON/OFF \u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u591a RIS \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u5e72\u6bd4\u3002"}}

Unlike classical distributed storage systems, DNA data storage containers are fundamentally constrained by sequencing technology, since each read operation yields the content of a uniformly random sampled strand from the container. Within this framework, we consider several erasure-correcting codes and analyze the expected recovery time of the data stored in a failed container.

To address these limitations, we introduce differentiable causal block diagrams ($\\partial$CBDs), a unifying formalism that integrates these three perspectives.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets.

However, most machine learning-based IDS approaches either assume static data distributions or rely on labeled attack samples, substantially limiting their applicability in real-world deployments. This setting naturally motivates continual novelty detection, which enables IDS models to incrementally adapt to non-stationary data streams without labeled attack data. In this work, we introduce ACORN-IDS, an adaptive continual novelty detection framework that learns exclusively from normal data while exploiting the inherent structure of an evolving unlabeled data stream. ACORN-IDS integrates a continual feature extractor, trained using reconstruction and metric learning objectives with clustering-based pseudo-labels, alongside a PCA-based reconstruction module for anomaly scoring. This design allows ACORN-IDS to continuously adapt to distributional shifts in both benign and malicious traffic. We conduct an extensive evaluation of ACORN-IDS on five realistic intrusion datasets under two continual learning scenarios: (i) Evolving Attacks and (ii) Evolving Normal and Attack Distributions. ACORN-IDS achieves, on average, a 62% improvement in F1-score and a 58% improvement in zero-day attack detection over the state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning baseline. It also outperforms existing state-of-the-art novelty detection approaches while exhibiting near-zero forgetting and imposing minimal inference overhead. These results demonstrate that ACORN-IDS offers a practical, label-efficient solution for building adaptive and robust IDS in dynamic, real-world environments.

Built upon this architecture, we introduce the Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based Multi-Expert Collaborative Decision (DHEA-MECD), a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm designed to support efficient and robust multi-target tracking. Specifically, in DHEA-MECD, a Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based information extraction framework is designed to semantically decompose raw sensory observations and explicitly model complex dependencies among heterogeneous features, including spatial configurations, kinematic states, structural constraints, and stochastic perturbations. On this basis, a motion-stage-aware multi-expert collaborative decision mechanism with Top-k expert selection strategy is introduced to support stage-adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, we propose the DHEA-MECD-based underwater multitarget tracking algorithm to enable AUV smart, stable, and anti-interference multi-target tracking.

The spatial smoothing-multiple signal classification algorithm is introduced to estimate the angle-of-arrival, whereas an iterative interference cancellation scheme is conceived for the remaining parameters' estimation. The corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds of channel parameters and user position are also derived. During the downlink communication phase, the estimated parameters are exploited to improve beamforming at the base station. Simulation results evaluate the impact of ADC quantizer resolutions.

Here the goal of the agents is to cooperatively minimize the sum of convex objective functions. When making decisions, each agent only has access to a stochastic gradient of its own objective function rather than the real gradient, and can exchange local state information with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. Particularly, the stochasticity is depicted by the Brownian motion. To handle this problem, we propose a continuous-time distributed stochastic gradient algorithm based on the consensus algorithm and the gradient descent strategy. Under mild assumptions on the connectivity of the graph and objective functions, using convex analysis theory, the Lyapunov theory and Ito formula, we prove that the states of the agents asymptotically reach a common minimizer in expectation.

On the medical imaging side, functional magnetic resonance imaging has provided invaluable insights into the neural pathways underlying Alzheimer's disease. While prior studies have used resting-state functional MRI by extracting functional connectivity matrices, these approaches neglect the temporal dynamics inherent in functional data. In this work, we present a deep state space modeling framework that directly leverages the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent time series to learn a sparse collection of brain regions to predict behavior scores. Our model extracts temporal features that encapsulate nuanced patterns of intrinsic brain activity, thereby enhancing predictive performance compared to traditional connectivity methods. We identify specific brain regions that are most predictive of cognitive impairment through experiments on data provided by the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, providing new insights into the neural substrates of early Alzheimer's pathology.

Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality--security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionality-preserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality-grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning-based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision.

By identifying the underlying stochastic transport mechanism as a Gaussian variance-mixture, we introduce and analyze the Normally-Drifted First-Hitting Location (NDFHL) family as a geometry-driven model for boundary-induced noise. Under a second-moment constraint, we derive an exact high-SNR capacity expansion and show that the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide at the constant level, yielding a vanishing capacity gap. As a consequence, isotropic Gaussian signaling is asymptotically capacity-achieving for all fixed drift strengths, despite the non-Gaussian and semi-heavy-tailed nature of the noise. The pre-log factor is determined solely by the dimension of the receiving boundary, revealing a geometric origin of the channel's degrees of freedom. The refined expansion further uncovers an entropy-dominant universality, whereby all physical parameters of the transport process -- including drift strength, diffusion coefficient, and boundary separation -- affect the capacity only through the differential entropy of the induced noise. Although the NDFHL density does not admit a simple closed form, its entropy is shown to be finite and to vary continuously as the drift vanishes, thereby connecting the finite-variance regime with the singular infinite-variance Cauchy limit. Together, these results provide a unified geometric and information-theoretic characterization of boundary-hitting channels across both regular and singular transport regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "NDFHL\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u5728\u9ad8SNR\u4e0b\u53ef\u7528\u7b49\u65b9\u5dee\u6b63\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ea\u53d7\u63a5\u6536\u8fb9\u754c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4f20\u8f93\u53c2\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u71b5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5dee\u968fSNR\u589e\u5927\u8d8b\u96f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7531\u591a\u7ef4\u6f02\u79fb\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u6781\u9650\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u4f20\u8f93\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5438\u6536\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7740\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u65b9\u5dee\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efaNDFHL\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8SNR\u5bb9\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0e\u71b5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6b63\u6001\u7b26\u53f7\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u5728\u9ad8SNR\u4e0b\u5bb9\u91cf\u8fbe\u6210\uff1b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u5bfc\u56e0\u5b50\u4ec5\u7531\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u6240\u6709\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5206\u71b5\u5f71\u54cd\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793aNDFHL\u5bc6\u5ea6\u71b5\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u6709\u9650\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u5947\u5f02\u7684Cauchy\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u56fa\u5b9a\u6f02\u79fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684NDFHL\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u7531\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5177\u4f53\u516c\u5f0f\u7ed9\u51fa\uff1b\u6b64\u65f6\u7b49\u65b9\u5dee\u6b63\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u754c\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\u5728\u5e38\u6570\u9879\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5dee\u968fSNR\u589e\u5927\u8d8b\u5411\u96f6\u3002"}}

However, this strategy often leads to severe communication congestion and high transmission latency, significantly degrading collaboration efficiency. This paper proposes a decentralized task-oriented semantic communication framework for multi-robot collaboration in unknown 3D environments. Each robot locally extracts compact, task-relevant semantics using a lightweight Pixel Difference Network (PiDiNet) with geometric processing. It shares only these semantic updates to build a task-sufficient 3D scene representation that supports cooperative perception, navigation, and object transport. Our numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits a dramatic reduction in communication overhead from $858.6$ Mb to $4.0$ Mb (over $200\\times$ compression gain) while improving collaboration efficiency by shortening task completion from $1,054$ to $281$ steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows such devices to offload inference tasks to edge servers (ESs), yet introduces latency due to communication and serverside queuing, especially in multi-user environments. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware offloading framework that dynamically decides whether to perform inference locally or offload it to the ES, based on token-level uncertainty and resource constraints. We define a margin-based token-level uncertainty metric and demonstrate its correlation with model accuracy. Leveraging this metric, we design a greedy offloading algorithm (GOA) that minimizes delay while maintaining accuracy by prioritizing offloading for highuncertainty queries. Our experiments show that GOA consistently achieves a favorable trade-off, outperforming baseline strategies in both accuracy and latency across varying user densities, and operates with practical computation time.

For regression, this allows users to obtain an uncertainty estimate for each output; for screening, it supports conservative decisions that minimize false negatives. We demonstrate our method by enhancing GridFM, the first open-source Foundation Model for power systems, with statistically valid prediction intervals instead of heuristic error margins. We apply it for N-k contingency assessment, a combinatorial NP-Hard problem. We show that trustworthy GridFM can offer richer and more accurate information than DC Power Flow, having 2x-3x higher precision, while running up to 18x faster than AC Power Flow for systems up to 118 buses. Moving a step further, we also examine the ability of trustworthy GridFM to generalize to unseen high-order contingencies: through a rigorous analysis, we assess how a model trained on N-1 or N-2 outages extrapolates to unseen contingencies up to N-5.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7535\u7f51 N\u2011k \u5e76\u53d1\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u8986\u76d6\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u66f4\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u5e76\u53d1\u60c5\u5f62\uff01", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08Foundation Models\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff01", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u9010\u5c42\u8986\u76d6\u9884\u6d4b\u6784\u9020\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u9608\u503c\uff01", "result": "\u5c06\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e GridFM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 N\u2011k \u5e76\u53d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83 DC \u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u9ad8 2\u20133 \u500d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u8f83 AC \u6c42\u89e3\u52a0\u901f 8\u201318 \u500d\uff01\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece N\u20111 / N\u20112 \u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5408\u7406\u5916\u63a8\u5230 N\u20115 \u7684\u672a\u89c1\u5e76\u53d1\uff01", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5c42\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf AC/ DC \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff01"}}

While this structure theoretically enables accurate channel estimation by sampling the response from one pilot symbol, practical implementation is constrained by the spreading of effective channel response induced by pulse shaping filters. To address this, we first derive the I/O relationship for discrete-time oversampled Zak-OTFS, which closely approximates the continuous-time system and facilitates analysis and numerical simulation. We show that every delay-Doppler domain symbol undergoes the same effective channel response under the discrete oversampled Zak-OTFS. We then analyze the impact of window ambiguity functions, and reveal that high sidelobes lead to wide channel spreading and degrade estimation accuracy. Building on this insight, we propose a novel pulse shaping filter design that synthesizes Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) within the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm (IOTA) framework.

Meanwhile, IPv6's massive address space breaks per-IP reputation and makes many defenses either non-scalable or narrowly scoped (e.g., only internal threats, only RA abuse, or only volumetric floods). We propose a zero-trust edge architecture implemented in a single programmable data-plane pipeline that unifies four modules: external spoofing, internal spoofing, external flooding, and internal flooding. A key design choice is to enforce identity plausibility before rate plausibility: stateless per-packet validation filters spoofed traffic early so that time-window statistics for flooding operate on credible identities. We outline a concrete P4 design (prefix Hop-Limit bands, DAD-anchored address-port bindings, and Count-Min Sketch windowed counting) and evaluate it across a systematic 15-scenario suite spanning single-, dual-, and multi-vector compositions.

Existing protocol-driven defenses and prior academic solutions largely assume stable identifiers or predictable beaconing. However, identifier-based defenses fundamentally break down against advanced rogue trackers that aggressively rotate identifiers. We present AirCatch, a passive detection system that exploits a physical-layer constraint: while logical identifiers can change arbitrarily fast, the transmitter's analog imprint remains stable and reappears as a compact and persistently occupied region in Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) feature space. AirCatch advances the state of the art along three axes: (i) a novel, modulation-aware CFO fingerprint that augments packet-level CFO with content-independent CFO components that amplify device distinctiveness; (ii) a new tracking detection algorithm based on high core density and persistence that is robust to contamination and evasion through per-identifier segmentation; and (iii) an ultra-low-cost receiver, an approximately 10 dollar BLE SDR named BlePhasyr, built from commodity components, that makes RF fingerprinting based detection practical in resource-constrained deployments. We evaluate AirCatch across Apple, Google, Tile, and Samsung tag families in multi-hour captures, systematically stress-test evasion using a scenario generator over a grid of transmission and rotation periods, and validate in diverse real-world mobility traces including home and office commutes, public transport, car travel, and airport journeys while sweeping background tag density. Across these stress tests, AirCatch achieves no false positives and early detection over a wide range of adversarial configurations and environments, degrading gracefully only in extreme low-rate regimes that also reduce attacker utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "AirCatch\u7528CFO\u6307\u7eb9\u548c\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6297\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65e0\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u6076\u610f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff1b", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8c03\u5236\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff08CFO\uff09\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6838\u5fc3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea610\u7f8e\u5143\u7684BlePhasyr SDR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u54c1\u724c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u5668\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cAirCatch\u5728\u65e0\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u7387\u65f6\u9000\u5316\uff1b", "conclusion": "AirCatch\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u5feb\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u963b\u6b62\u975e\u6cd5\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u8bef\u62a5\uff1b"}}

Under mild excitation conditions, the resulting air velocity and tilt estimation error dynamics are shown to be uniformly observable. The estimated tilt is then combined with magnetometer measurements in a nonlinear observer on SO(3) to recover the full attitude.

Numerous methods have been proposed to jointly optimize key performance metrics such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. However, the computational complexity of these methods often grows rapidly with the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). To tackle this challenge, we prove a fundamental structural property of the ISAC beamforming problem, i.e., there exists an optimal solution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure. This leads to an equivalent reformulation of the problem with dimension related to the number of users rather than the number of BS antennas, thereby enabling the development of low-complexity algorithms. When applying the interior-point method to the reformulated problem, we achieve up to six orders of magnitude in complexity reduction when the number of antennas exceeds the number of users by an order of magnitude. To further reduce the complexity, we develop a balanced augmented Lagrangian method to solve the reformulated problem. The proposed algorithm maintains optimality while achieving a computational complexity that scales quartically with the number of users.

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper addresses the fundamental question: Can arbitrary electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays achieve unambiguous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization when element spacing exceeds $\u03bb/2$? We provide an affirmative answer by exploiting the multi-component structure of EMVS measurements and developing a synergistic estimation and optimization framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bistatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. A third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) model is constructed from EMVS observations, enabling natural separation of spatial, polarimetric, and propagation effects via the trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. A novel phase-disambiguation procedure leverages rotational invariance across the six electromagnetic components of EMVSs to resolve $2\u03c0$ phase wrapping in arbitrary array geometries, allowing unambiguous joint estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) direction of departure (DOD), two-dimensional direction of arrival (DOA), and polarization parameters with automatic pairing. To support localization in NLOS environments and enhance estimation robustness, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is incorporated and its phase shifts are optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to maximize received signal power, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and further suppressing spatial ambiguities through iterative refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u95f4\u8dddEMVS\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u5408RIS\u548cPARAFAC\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5e45\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96f7\u8fbe\u9635\u5217\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u03bb/2\u95f4\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u5b54\u5f84\u548c\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff1b\u63a2\u8ba8\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7EMVS\u4e0eRIS\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u8be5\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6a21\u7cca\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636PARAFAC\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7TALS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u504f\u632f\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u5229\u7528EMVS\u516d\u4e2a\u7535\u78c1\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f4d\u53bb\u7f20\u7ed5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\uff08SDP\uff09\u4f18\u5316RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u53cc\u5411MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4DOD\u3001DOA\u53ca\u504f\u632f\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u7cca\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5206\u91cfEMVS\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001PARAFAC\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cd\u6392\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u95f4\u8ddd\u5927\u4e8e\u03bb/2\u7684\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u65e0\u5e45\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u7684RMS\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u3002"}}

In this case, how to fully utilize the spatial resources by designing the transmit beamforming such that both sensing and communication can achieve satisfactory performance statistically is a difficult problem, which motivates the study in this paper. Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations.

LDME is organized in three layers: (i) dual-path denoising (DWT with adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing) to suppress broadband noise while preserving transient fault structure; (ii) multi-scale damage enhancement using a Teager-Kaiser pre-amplifier followed by a Hadamard-Caputo fractional operator that accentuates non-sinusoidal, low-frequency fault signatures; and (iii) decision fusion, where harmonics-aware Fourier indicators are combined and scored by an unsupervised anomaly detector. Evaluation using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, the HUMS 2023 planetary gearbox benchmark, and a controlled simulated dataset shows that LDME consistently distinguishes nominal, early-crack, and propagated-crack stages under various operating conditions. LDME identifies the primary detection event earlier (198 cycles) than HT-TSA (284 cycles) and advances maintenance recommendation time from 383 to 365 cycles.

In this regard, due to the inherent ability to combine the strengths of multiple models, ensemble learning can realize more robust and diverse anomaly detection further enhance IDS accuracy, thereby improving robustness and efficiency of the secure LAE.

This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP.

Motivated by the trends toward cloud-edge collaboration and the Artificial Intelligence - Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) paradigm, we develop a cloud-edge collaborative framework for scalable CKM construction, which enables knowledge sharing across tasks, devices, and regions by explicitly decoupling a generalizable CKM prior from the information provided by local observations.

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u670d\u52a1\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u5907\u62b5\u6297\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7Fill+Squeeze\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u538b\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u8f93\u5165\u89e6\u53d1\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014Fill\u4e0eSqueeze\u3002Fill\u9636\u6bb5\u8017\u5c3d\u5168\u5c40kv\u7f13\u5b58\u4ee5\u5f15\u53d1Head-of-Line\u963b\u585e\uff1bSqueeze\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5165\u91cd\u590d\u62a2\u5360\u5468\u671f\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u590d\u6742\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u5185\u5b58\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u653b\u51fb\uff0cFill\uff06Squeeze\u5728Time to First Token\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4ea7\u751f20\u2013280\u00d7\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0cTime Per Output Token\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e1.5\u20134\u00d7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e30\u201340%\u3002\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8584\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u591a\u88ab\u8fde\u7eed\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u5c4f\u853d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684fill\u2011squeeze\u653b\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u63a7\u8c03\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cLLM\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a two-stage near-ML decoding framework that applies to any linear block code. In the first stage, we run a low-complexity decoder to produce a candidate codeword and a cyclic redundancy check. When this stage succeeds, we terminate immediately. When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder attains near-ML performance for short-blocklength, low-rate codes while maintaining low decoding latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fd1ML\u89e3\u7801\uff1a\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9996\u9009\uff1b\u5931\u8d25\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u70b9\u7801\u6743\u7403\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4f4e\u6743\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1ML\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u5305URLLC\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4ML\u89e3\u7801\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8981\u4e48\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u53ef\u9760\u53c8\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8fd1ML\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u5019\u9009\u7801\u5b57\u5e76\u6821\u9a8c\uff1b\u82e5\u5931\u8d25\u5219\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u70b9\u7801\u6743\u7403\u89e3\u7801\uff08MP-WSD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6743\u7801\u5b57\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u6b27\u6c0f\u7403\u5185\u9010\u6b65\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u5757\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u7ebf\u8def\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1ML\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u523b\u610f\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fd1ML\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u77ed\u5757\u957f\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7684\u8fd1ML\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This flexibility can be maximized if the devices are coordinated centrally, given some level of information about the controlled devices. In this paper, we propose novel optimization-based control schemes with prediction capabilities that utilize limited information from heat pumps, electric water heaters, and electric vehicles. The objective is to flatten the total load curve seen by the distribution transformer by restricting the times at which the available flexible loads are allowed to operate, subject to the flexibility constraints of the loads to preserve customers' comfort. The original scheme was tested in a real-world setup, considering both winter and summer days. The pilot results confirmed the technical feasibility but also informed the design of an improved version of the controller. Computer simulations using the adjusted controller show that, compared to the original formulation, the improved scheme achieves greater peak reductions in summer. Additionally, comparisons were made with an ideal controller, which assumes perfect knowledge of the inflexible load profile, the models of the controlled devices, the hot water and space heating demand, and future electric vehicle charging sessions.

In contrast to existing methods it allows reliable quantization to arbitrary bit-levels including the extreme case of using a single bit per data coefficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u6b21\u566a\u58f0\u5851\u5f62\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5e26\u9650\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u540e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u6295\u5c04\uff08single-shot\uff09 noise shaping \u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e26\u9650\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u4e25\u683c\u8bef\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6bd4\u7279\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5c04\u566a\u58f0\u5851\u5f62\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5e26\u9650\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u4f4d\uff08\u751a\u81f3\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Wearable gesture-based communication enables low-effort, nonverbal interaction, but existing systems leak motion data, intermediate representations, or inference outputs to untrusted infrastructure, enabling intent inference, behavioral biometric leakage, and insider attacks. This work proposes a privacy-preserving gesture-based covert communication system that ensures, no raw sensor signals, learned features, or classification outputs are exposed to any third-party. The system employs a multi-party homomorphic learning pipeline for gesture recognition directly over encrypted motion data, preventing adversaries from inferring gesture semantics, replaying sensor traces, or accessing intermediate representations. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply encrypted gesture recognition in a wearable-based covert communication setting. We design and evaluate haptic and visual feedback mechanisms for covert signal delivery and evaluate the system using 600 gesture samples from a commodity smartwatch, achieving over 94.44% classification accuracy and demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system with practical deployability from high-performance systems to resource-constrained edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9690\u853d\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738794.44%\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u9ad8\u7aef\u5230\u4f4e\u7aef\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u853d\u6216\u9632\u62a4\u5173\u952e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6613\u66b4\u9732\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u624b\u52bf\u901a\u4fe1\u4f1a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u6cc4\u9732\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4efb\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u65b9\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u4f55\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u83b7\u53d6\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528600\u6761\u5546\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u624b\u52bf\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc794.44%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ece\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u52a0\u5bc6\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Under review at Automatica", "summary": "This paper investigates the stability and stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics, modeled as interconnections of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the long-standing practice of neglecting transient tire dynamics in vehicle modeling and control, a rigorous justification is provided for such simplifications using singular perturbation theory. A perturbation parameter, defined as the ratio between a characteristic rolling contact length and the vehicle's longitudinal speed, is introduced to formalize the time-scale separation between rigid-body motion and tire dynamics. For sufficiently small values of this parameter, it is demonstrated that standard finite-dimensional techniques can be applied to analyze the local stability of equilibria and to design stabilizing controllers. Both state-feedback and output-feedback designs are considered, under standard stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Whilst the proposed controllers follow classical approaches, the novelty of the work lies in establishing the first mathematical framework that rigorously connects distributed tire models with conventional vehicle dynamics. The results reconcile decades of empirical findings with a formal theoretical foundation and open new perspectives for the analysis and control of ODE-PDE systems with distributed friction in automotive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this formulation, vertices represent candidate codewords and edges connect pairs whose longest common subsequence (LCS) distance guarantees correction of up to $d$ deletions. A valid codebook corresponds to a clique in the resulting graph, and finding the largest codebook is equivalent to identifying a maximum clique. While MCP-based formulations for deletion-correcting codes have previously been explored, we demonstrate that applying Penalty-Guided Clique Search (PGCS), a lightweight stochastic clique-search heuristic inspired by Dynamic Local Search (DLS), consistently yields larger codebooks than existing graph-based heuristics, including minimum-degree and coloring methods, for block lengths $n = 8,9,\\dots,14$ and deletion parameters $d = 1,2,3$. In several finite-length regimes, the resulting codebooks match known optimal sizes and outperform classical constructions such as Helberg codes. For decoding under segmented reception, where codeword boundaries are known, we propose an optimized LCS-based decoder that exploits symbol-count filtering and early termination to substantially reduce the number of LCS evaluations while preserving exact decoding guarantees.

A passivity-exploiting backstepping design is presented, which leverages the strict dissipativity properties of the PDE subsystem to achieve exponential stabilization of the considered ODE-PDE interconnection around a prescribed equilibrium. Sufficient conditions for local well-posedness and exponential convergence are derived by constructing a Lyapunov functional combining the lumped and distributed states. Both state-feedback and output-feedback controllers are synthesized, the latter relying on a cascaded observer.

To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security.

Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy. Our work demonstrates that LM watermarking is fundamentally a channel coding problem, paving the way for principled coding-theoretic approaches to watermark design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u4f4d\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faArcMark\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u4f4d\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6c34\u5370\u672c\u8d28\u4e3a\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u4f4d\u6c34\u5370\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4f4d\u4e00\u6bd4\u7279\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u591a\u4f4d\u6c34\u5370\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1ArcMark\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f4d\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "ArcMark\u5728\u4f4d\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u68c0\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4f4d\u6c34\u5370\u662f\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u754c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfcArcMark\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bb9\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated theorem proving increasingly feasible. However, most prior work focuses on mathematics-oriented benchmarks such as miniF2F, with limited evaluation on real-world verification projects. The few studies that consider industrial-scale verification mostly rely on closed-source models with hundreds of billions of parameters, which cannot be locally deployed and incur substantial usage costs. In this paper, we propose AutoReal, an LLM-driven theorem proving method for real-world industrial-scale systems with support for lightweight local deployment. We evaluate AutoReal on the seL4-Isabelle verification project as a representative and challenging case study. AutoReal incorporates two key improvements: (1) chain-of-thought (CoT)-based proof training, which teaches the LLM the reasoning behind proof steps and enables step-wise explanations alongside proofs, and (2) context augmentation, which leverages proof context from the project to enhance LLM-driven proving. Based on the AutoReal methodology, we fine-tune a base model to obtain AutoReal-Prover, a compact 7B-scale prover for industrial-scale theorem proving. AutoReal-Prover achieves a 51.67% proof success rate on 660 theorems from seL4-designated Important Theories across all 10 seL4 proof categories, substantially outperforming prior attempts on seL4 (27.06%). To evaluate generalization, we further apply AutoReal-Prover to three security-related projects from the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP), covering all 451 theorems and achieving a proof success rate of 53.88%.

Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines. These results demonstrate that ICL can bridge synthetic pretraining and real-world adaptability, opening new directions for data efficient control of physical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Transformer\u2011ICL \u7535\u673a\u524d\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5b9e\u673a\u6837\u672c\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e PI \u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684 PI \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u56e0\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5c06 LLM \u7684 ICL \u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7535\u673a\u524d\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u5f0f ICL\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u968f\u540e\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u673a\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b21\u5f0f\u524d\u9988\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u7535\u673a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u524d\u9988\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf PI \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u9988\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86 ICL \u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8854\u63a5\u5408\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, deploying these technologies is hindered by large-scale optimization problems with nonconvex constraints. Conventional Euclidean-space methods rely on approximations or relaxations, which degrade performance and incur substantial computational costs. Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) offers a powerful alternative that directly operates on the manifold defined by the geometric constraints. This approach inherently satisfies the constraints at every optimization step, thereby avoiding the performance degradation and substantial computational costs. In this paper, we first elaborate on the principles of RMO, including the fundamental concepts, tools, and methods, emphasizing its effectiveness for nonconvex problems. We then introduce its applications in advanced wireless communications, showing how constrained problems are reformulated on their natural manifolds and solved using tailored RMO algorithms.

We begin by modeling the entire communication process from the encoder output to the decoder input, encompassing the physical channel and all transceiver operations, as the SF channel, thereby establishing an encoder-SF channel-decoder pipeline. In contrast to prior studies that assume a fixed SF channel, we note that the SF channel is configurable, as its characteristics are shaped by various transmission and reception strategies, such as power allocation. Based on this observation, we formulate the SF channel optimization problem under a mutual information constraint between the SFs and their reconstructions, and analytically derive the optimal SF channel under a linear encoder-decoder structure and Gaussian source assumption.

To realize the optimized SF channel, we also propose a physical-layer calibration strategy that enables real-time power control and adaptation to varying channel conditions.

We show that this composition introduces a distinct security failure mode: a vector-retrieved \"seed\" chunk can pivot via entity links into sensitive graph neighborhoods, causing cross-tenant data leakage that does not occur in vector-only retrieval. We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.\n  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.\n  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead.

This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews. Across all datasets, we observe that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under the same query budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, when the number of beams is large, the existing MAB algorithms are characterized by long exploration times, resulting in poor overall communication throughput. In this work, we propose augmenting the upper confidence bound (UCB) based MAB with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to address this limitation. The premise of the work is that the radar and communication functionalities share the same field-of-view and that communication mobile users are detected by the radar as mobile targets. The radar information is used for significantly reducing the number of candidate beams for the UCB, resulting in an overall reduction in the exploration time. Further, the radar information is used to estimate the realignment time in quasi-stationary scenarios. We have realized the MAB and radar signal processing algorithms on the system on chip (SoC) via hardware-software co-design (HSCD) and fixed-point analysis. We demonstrate the significant gain in execution time using accelerators. The simulations consider complex propagation channels involving direct and multipath, with simple and extended radar targets in the presence of significant static clutter.

MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L$^3$), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L$^3$ learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L$^3$ on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility.

However, tracking mobile users on the ground by each UAV and the corresponding synchronization between the UAVs is a significant issue that must be addressed before this framework can be deployed in reality. Incorporating additional sensing capabilities to facilitate this additional requirement would introduce significant overhead in terms of hardware, cost, and power to each UAV. Instead, we propose an integrated sensing and communications-enabled swarm UAV system, based on the millimeter-wave IEEE 802.11ad protocol. Further, we show that our proposed system is capable of five-dimensional (5-D) ground target sensing (range, Doppler velocity, azimuth, elevation, and polarization) in an urban environment. Numerical experiments using realistic models demonstrate and validate the performance of 5-D sensing using our proposed 802-11ad-aided UAV system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u8bae\u5c06\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2802.11ad\u534f\u8bae\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b05D\u5730\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u707e\u533a\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u707e\u533a\u548c\u504f\u8fdc\u5730\u533a\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u9760\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u5355\u9897\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7eed\u822a\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u6bcf\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5730\u9762\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u52a0\u88c5\u989d\u5916\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u786c\u4ef6\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u529f\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2IEEE\u00a0802.11ad\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u65f6\u57df/\u9891\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5730\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e94\u7ef4\uff08\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u3001\u4ef0\u89d2\u3001\u6781\u5316\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e94\u7ef4\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u94fe\u8def\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u9699\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, structured beam schemes based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs) fail to fully exploit the array aperture, thereby limiting their topological reconfigurability and adaptability to diverse communication scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Fuzzing firmware in re-hosted environments is a promising method for automated testing at scale, but remains difficult due to the tight coupling of code with a microcontroller's peripherals. Existing fuzzing frameworks primarily address input challenges in providing inputs for Memory-Mapped I/O or interrupts, but largely overlook Direct Memory Access (DMA), a key high-throughput interface used that bypasses the CPU. We introduce DyMA-Fuzz to extend recent advances in stream-based fuzz input injection to DMA-driven interfaces in re-hosted environments. It tackles key challenges--vendor-specific descriptors, heterogeneous DMA designs, and varying descriptor locations--using runtime analysis techniques to infer DMA memory access patterns and automatically inject fuzzing data into target buffers, without manual configuration or datasheets. Evaluated on 94 firmware samples and 8 DMA-guarded CVE benchmarks, DyMA-Fuzz reveals vulnerabilities and execution paths missed by state-of-the-art tools and achieves up to 122% higher code coverage. These results highlight DyMA-Fuzz as a practical and effective advancement in automated firmware testing and a scalable solution for fuzzing complex embedded systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose a reconfigurable architecture for Doppler estimation realized on a system on chip using hardware software codesign. The architecture supports algorithm level reconfiguration, dynamically switching between low-complexity, high-speed FFT-based coarse estimation and high complexity ESPRIT based fine estimation. We introduce modifications to ESPRIT that achieve 6.7 times faster execution while reducing memory and multiplier usage by 79% and 63%, respectively, compared to state of the art approaches, without compromising accuracy.

We address this challenge in a client-server setting where an untrusted server hosts an autoregressive Transformer and the client requires cryptographic protection for both inputs and inference. We present CryptoGen, the first system to enable scalable privacy-preserving neural generation with persistent encrypted key-value (KV) cache reuse. Discriminative-task secure inference systems incur quadratic latency and memory growth when adapted to autoregressive decoding due to the lack of native encrypted KV-cache support. In contrast, CryptoGen achieves near-linear scaling by securely reusing and updating encrypted KV caches throughout generation. CryptoGen integrates homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to support both prefilling and generation. Key techniques include a unified encrypted KV-cache framework, heterogeneous SIMD encodings for different phases, optimized cipher-cipher matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations, and efficient noise refresh and ciphertext concatenation mechanisms. Evaluation on generative Transformer models trained on WikiText-2, PTB, and LAMBADA shows that for input lengths of 128-512 tokens, CryptoGen achieves 4.4x-7.6x lower per-token latency than state-of-the-art discriminative secure inference systems, while maintaining near-linear latency and memory scaling, with advantages increasing for longer sequences.

In order to study the maximum data rate that is feasible in such kind of OCC systems, this paper presents its equivalent digital communication system model in which the rolling-shutter camera is modeled as a rectangular matched-filter whose time width is equal to the exposure time of the camera, followed by a sampling process at the pixel row sweep rate of the camera. Based on the proposed rolling-shutter camera model, the maximum symbol rate that such OCC systems can support is experimentally demonstrated, and the impact of imperfect time synchronization between the VLC transmitter and the rolling-shutter OCC receiver is characterized in the form of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). The equivalent three-tap channel model that results from this process is experimentally validated and the generated ISI is compensated with the use of linear equalization in reception. Simulation and experimental results show a strong correlation between them, demonstrating that the proposed approach can be used to make the OCC system work at the Nyquist sampling rate, which is equivalent to the pixel row sweep rate of the rolling-shutter camera used in reception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u77e9\u5f62\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u53e3\u8870\u51cf\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5747\u8861\u53ef\u8865\u507f\u540c\u6b65\u8bef\u5dee\uff0cOCC\u53ef\u8fbe\u50cf\u7d20\u626b\u63cf\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684Nyquist\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u6355\u83b7\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1LED\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u5149\u5f3a\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u9610\u660e\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e9\u5f62\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u884c\u626b\u63cf\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6700\u5927\u7b26\u53f7\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u7aef\u53e3\u8870\u51cf\u91cf\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5747\u8861\u8865\u507f ISI\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e09\u53e3\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ebf\u6027\u5747\u8861\u6709\u6548\u8865\u507f ISI\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5728\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u50cf\u7d20\u884c\u626b\u901f\u7387\uff08\u5373Nyquist\u901f\u7387\uff09\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u6570\u5b57\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e09\u6372\u9053\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5747\u8861\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728Nyquist\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0OCC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3002"}}

The baseline architecture in Hyperledger Fabric constrains transaction requests due to endorsement, ordering and validation phases, leading to a throughput of 5 to 7 TPS with an average latency of 4 seconds. Our Layer-2 solution achieves an ingestion throughput of 70 to 100 TPS, leading to an increase of nearly ten times due to the sequencer immediate acceptance of each transaction and reducing client perceived latency by nearly eighty percent to 700 to 1000 milliseconds.

The goal of this paper is to reevaluate the PAKE model by noting that the absence of a PKI -- or, more generally, of a mechanism aside from the password for authenticating the server -- makes such protocols vulnerable to reverse online guessing attacks, in which an adversary attempts to validate password guesses by impersonating a server. While their logic is similar to traditional guessing, where the attacker impersonates a client, reverse guessing poses a unique risk because the burden of detection is shifted to the clients, rendering existing defenses against traditional guessing moot. Our results demonstrate that reverse guessing is particularly effective when an adversary attacks clients indiscriminately, such as in phishing or password-spraying attacks, or for applications with automated login processes or a universal password, such as WPA3-SAE. Our analysis suggests that stakeholders should, by default, authenticate the server using more stringent measures than just the user's password, and that a password-only mode of operation should be a last resort against catastrophic security failures when other authentication mechanisms are not available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats.

Our analysis highlights the transition behavior of the ZZB and underscores the fundamental limitations and opportunities for accurate near-field sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZZB\u662f\u8fd1\u573a\u5b9a\u4f4d/\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u80fd\u6307\u5bfc\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u7387\u5347\u9ad8\u3001\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd1\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684 CRB \u5728\u4f4e SNR \u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7403\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4e0e\u9635\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5229\u7528 ZZB \u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u9635\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6ce2\u957f\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a ZZB \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u4e0b\uff0cZZB \u80fd\u591f\u6bd4 CRB \u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u8fd1\u573a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6216\u9608\u503c\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively.

In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process.

Code available", "summary": "AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.
