Abstract: While most LLMs are autoregressive, diffusion-based LLMs have recently emerged as an alternative method for generation. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks have proven effective against autoregressive models, but their applicability to diffusion language models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an exploratory study of GCG-style adversarial prompt attacks on LLaDA (Large Language Diffusion with mAsking), an open-source diffusion LLM. We evaluate multiple attack variants, including prefix perturbations and suffix-based adversarial generation, on harmful prompts drawn from the AdvBench dataset. Our study provides initial insights into the robustness and attack surface of diffusion language models and motivates the development of alternative optimization and evaluation strategies for adversarial analysis in this setting.

### [2] [Divide and Refine: Enhancing Multimodal Representation and Explainability for Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14274)
*Anh-Tuan Mai,Cam-Van Thi Nguyen,Duc-Trong Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DnR框架通过先把模态拆分为唯一、冗余与协同三部分，再通过针对性目标进行细化，显著提升了多模态情感识别任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别依赖于有效融合多模态信号，但传统方法往往忽视原始数据准备对唯一性、冗余性和协同性三种信息的影响。

Method: 提出两阶段框架DnR：第一阶段“Divide”将每个模态显式分解为唯一性、成对冗余和协同三个子部分；第二阶段“Refine”通过专门设计的目标函数提升各子部分的信息量，同时保持其独立性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的多种基线模型上，DnR实现了显著且一致的性能提升，验证了显式分解和精炼策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 显式划分、精炼并重新组合多模态表示，为多模态情感识别提供了一种系统且原则性的改进途径。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) requires representations that effectively integrate signals from multiple modalities. These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \emph{unique}, \emph{redundant}, and \emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \emph{\textbf{D}ivide and \textbf{R}efine} (\textbf{DnR}). In the \textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/mattam301/DnR-WACV2026

Result: 数值仿真显示EIGP及其变种在多种基准下均优于现有分布式GP方法，预测精度提升显著，且能实时更新。

Conclusion: 本研究表明在分布式多智能体系统中，模型质量高于数量才是合作学习的关键，引入了基于错误信息的选择机制以实现高质量模型的合作，有效提升预测性能。

Abstract: Effective cooperation is pivotal in distributed learning for multi-agent systems, where the interplay between the quantity and quality of the machine learning models is crucial. This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.

*Uygar Kurt*

TL;DR: 对Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct在多种量化方案下进行统一性能测评，结合推理质量与资源占用，给出实用的选型指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化可以降低模型所需的存储与计算精度，从而减小显存占用并提升在资源受限设备上的运行速度。本工作关注llama.cpp的量化方案，为用户在本地部署LLM时提供实用选择依据。

Method: 对单一现代模型Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct（FP16, GGUF）进行统一实验，覆盖3-8位K-quant及旧版量化格式，评估下游推理、知识、指令跟随与真值性等标准基准；同时测量困惑度、CPU吞吐量（填充/解码）、模型尺寸、压缩率与量化时间。

Conclusion: 本文为llama.cpp不同量化格式提供实战性评估，帮助用户根据自身需求（精度、速度、内存）做出明智的选型决定。

Abstract: Quantization is a practical technique for making large language models easier to deploy by reducing the precision used to store and operate on model weights. This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.

### [5] [On the Limits of Learned Importance Scoring for KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14279)
*Brady Steele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIP这套学习式KV压缩方案未超越简单的随机或位置启发方法，说明位置与预填注意已提供足够信号，KV其他信息增益有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究KV缓存压缩中是否存在比位置和预填注意更丰富的信息，可通过学习模型提高重要性预测，从而优化缓存利用率。

Method: 利用1.7M参数、非查询感知的SIP模型，从KV表示中直接预测每个标记的重要性，使用多视角前瞻和跨注意力机制进行评估；与随机基线、位置启发式等进行对比。

Result: SIP在多项实验中未能优于随机或位置基启发式，且不同种子和任务表现一致；表明KV表示中存在的信息不足以支持更精细的预测。

Conclusion: SIP（Speculative Importance Prediction）在4个保留水平、5个随机种子和3个任务上并未优于简单基线（如随机选择）。位置基的启发式（保留前4个和后N个标记）与甚至超过了学习方法；预填注意力提供了与复杂学习评估器相当的信号；KV表示中除位置和预填注意外的额外信息对重要性预测几乎没有帮助。可能的原因是未来查询与生成轨迹之间的循环依赖导致难以学习。

Abstract: We investigate learned KV cache compression through Speculative Importance Prediction (SIP), a 1.7M parameter non-query-aware scorer that predicts token importance from KV representations alone. Despite architectural sophistication (multi-horizon lookahead, cross-attention), SIP does not outperform simple baselines, including random selection, across 5 seeds, 4 retention levels, and 3 tasks. Key findings: (1) position-based heuristics (keep first 4 + last N tokens) match or exceed learned approaches; (2) prefill attention provides equivalent signal to complex learned scorers; (3) marginal information in KV representations beyond position and prefill attention appears limited for importance prediction. We hypothesize that circular dependence between future queries and generation trajectories contributes to this difficulty.

Abstract: Currently, the field of structure-based drug design is dominated by three main types of algorithms: search-based algorithms, deep generative models, and reinforcement learning. While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations. All the code that are used for benchmarking is available in https://github.com/zkysfls/2025-sbdd-benchmark

TL;DR: 本文通过把树结构编码为矩阵并比较不同距离，证明标准化距离在树聚类中优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生命科学中，树状结构普遍出现（如RNA二级结构、系统发育树），新的测序技术与人工智能产生大量可用树形数据，需要高效、可解释的分析方法。

Method: 利用树多项式将树结构转换为矩阵，通过Canberra距离进行测量，并实现两种基本自编码器进行聚类。

Result: 与其他距离度量比较，条目级标准化距离在基于树多项式的聚类中取得最高准确率；自编码器模型表现相对较弱。

Conclusion: 距离度量方法—尤其是基于条目级标准化距离的计算—在树聚类任务中表现出最高的准确性。

Abstract: Tree structures appear in many fields of the life sciences, including phylogenetics, developmental biology and nucleic acid structures. Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures. In this paper, we compare the performance of different distances in tree clustering methods based on a tree distinguishing polynomial. We also implement two basic autoencoder models for clustering trees using the polynomial. We find that the distance based methods with entry-level normalized distances have the highest clustering accuracy among the compared methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoM offers a low‑cost, high‑accuracy memory framework for LLMs, outperforming baseline methods with significant speed and resource benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome high construction costs and poor alignment between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy in existing two-stage memory paradigms.

Method: Uses lightweight memory construction and a dynamic Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into inference paths with adaptive truncation.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines with 7.5%-10.4% accuracy gains and reduces token consumption to ~2.7% and latency to ~6.0% compared to complex architectures.

Conclusion: CoM (Chain-of-Memory) framework achieves higher accuracy and lower computational cost than traditional memory systems for LLM agents.

Abstract: External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.

*Jun Liu,Leo Yu Zhang,Fengpeng Li,Isao Echizen,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新定义硬标签攻击为梯度符号恢复问题，并提出基于频域初始化与模式驱动优化的新框架，理论证明其优良性，并在多任务多模型实验中显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬标签黑盒场景只观测到top‑1标签，难以直接获取梯度信息。作者探讨是否可以通过离散响应间接恢复梯度符号，企图将现有启发式搜索攻击转化为有理论依据的梯度符号恢复过程，并基于此设计更高效的攻击方法。

Method: 提出无查询频域初始化以及模式驱动优化（PDO）策略。频域初始化利用对数可能查找潜在梯度方向，使初始向量与真实梯度符号的余弦相似度高于随机基线；随后PDO通过逐步调整模式特征的搜索，以梯度符号方向为目标，显著降低查询次数。

Result: 在多种数据集（CIFAR‑10、ImageNet、ObjectNet）、模型类型（标准、对抗训练、商业API、CLIP）与任务（图像分类、密集预测、医学数据等）上，所提出的方法在攻击成功率和查询效率上均优于现有最先进攻防策略；在低查询 regimes 下表现尤为突出，并达成了对Blacklight防御的完全绕过。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在硬标签黑盒攻击中，现有的基于符号翻转的攻击本质上相当于近似恢复真实损失梯度的符号。基于这一理论视角，作者提出了结合无查询频域初始化和模式驱动优化（PDO）的新攻击框架，并给出了初始状态相对完整梯度方向更相似、查询复杂度更低的理论保证。实验表明，该框架在CIFAR-10/Imagenet/ObjectNet以及商业API、CLIP模型上均显著优于现有SOTA攻击，尤其在低查询量下表现突出，并成功规避了Blacklight等先进的流状态防御。

Abstract: Hard-label black-box settings, where only top-1 predicted labels are observable, pose a fundamentally constrained yet practically important feedback model for understanding model behavior. A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\%$ detection rate. Our code will be released publicly soon at https://github.com/csjunjun/DPAttack.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态边缘推理在带宽受限的无线链路上面临高通信开销与在多变信道与噪声输入条件下鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: ①本地多模态自监督学习，生成共享与模态特定编码器，避免设备-服务器交换；②分布式微调并采用集中证据融合校准模态不确定性，可靠聚合受噪声或衰落影响的特征；③不确定性引导的反馈机制，对不确定样本选择性请求额外特征，优化通信-精度权衡。

Result: 在RGB–depth室内场景分类任务中，该框架在训练通信轮数大幅减少的同时，获得更高准确率，并对模态退化或信道变化保持鲁棒，优于现有自监督与完全监督基线。

Conclusion: 该三阶段通信感知分布式学习框架在保证鲁棒性的同时显著提升了多模态边缘推理的通信与推理效率，能够在无线信道条件下实现更高准确率、更低通信轮数和对模态降解的耐受性。

Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.

TL;DR: LAEP是面向MoE LLM预训练的新型自适应剪枝算法，通过剔除低利用专家并重新分布专家以提升效率，实验显示提升48.3%训练效率并减少33.3%参数，保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型凭借少量激活参数实现高精度，但其预训练过程因专家资源浪费和训练效率低下而成为瓶颈，需要一种在预训练阶段就能提升效率的剪枝方法。

Method: 通过针对低利用率专家进行层级自适应剪枝，并根据令牌分布统计信息将专家重新分布到计算设备，以实现更高的训练效率和更合理的资源利用。

Result: 在1010B Base模型从零开始预训练时，LAEP实现了48.3%的训练效率提升和33.3%的参数缩减，且在多个领域保持了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: LAEP在MoE LLM的预训练阶段显著提高训练效率并显著压缩模型参数量，同时仍保持优秀的跨领域性能。

Abstract: Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver superior accuracy with a reduced number of active parameters, their pre-training represents a significant computationally bottleneck due to underutilized experts and limited training efficiency. This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.

Method: 提出层级化上下文提升强化学习框架，该框架可根据用户行为动态调整上下文粒度，从系统级别到用户级别；利用上下文相似度实现策略迁移，并将提升建模（uplift modeling）原理融入算法。

Abstract: Contextual Bandit (CB) algorithms are widely adopted for personalized recommendations but often struggle in dynamic environments typical of fantasy sports, where rapid changes in user behavior and dramatic shifts in reward distributions due to external influences necessitate frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system. We subsequently deployed this system to production as the default catalog personalization system in May 2025 and observed a further 0.5% revenue improvement.

Conclusion: VJEPA与BJEPA提出了一种可扩展的无像素重建、概率化的预测性表述框架，证明其在最优控制中可作为充分信息状态，并通过变分目标避免表征崩溃。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a scalable paradigm for self-supervised learning by predicting latent representations rather than reconstructing high-entropy observations. However, existing formulations rely on \textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种在线自适应核密度方法，实时将风险分数流切分为符合容量约束的多队列，避免手动阈值，降低阈值抖动，且计算和内存开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 top‑K 或手动阈值设置无法灵活适应流式风险分数的漂移与多模态分布；需要一种能够实时满足吞吐量约束且不依赖标签的动态分割方法。

Method: 通过在线自适应核密度估计，将密度转换为尾质量曲线以满足容量限制，并在不同带宽下检测密度谷并进行“snap”，实现无标签多队列路由，支持滑动窗口或指数遗忘更新。

Result: 在合成、漂移、多模态的分数流上，方法实现了与容量约束的竞争性匹配，同时显著降低了阈值抖动；每个事件更新仅需 O(G) 时间，且每个活动只需常数内存。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在实时环境下将风险分数流转换为符合容量约束的复数审查队列，且保持低阈值抖动，资源消耗低。

Abstract: We study the problem of converting a stream of risk scores into one or more review queues under explicit intake constraints[cite: 6]. Instead of top-$K$ or manually tuned cutoffs, we fit an online adaptive kernel density to the score stream, transform the density into a tail-mass curve to meet capacity, and ``snap'' the resulting cut to a persistent density valley detected across bandwidths[cite: 7]. The procedure is label-free, supports multi-queue routing, and operates in real time with sliding windows or exponential forgetting[cite: 8]. On synthetic, drifting, multimodal streams, the method achieves competitive capacity adherence while reducing threshold jitter[cite: 9]. Updates cost $O(G)$ per event with constant memory per activity

Realizing p-bits with emerging devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) introduces device variability, which was expected to negatively impact computational performance. However, this study reveals an unexpected finding: device variability can not only degrade but also enhance algorithm performance, particularly by leveraging timing variability. This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated, open-source simulated annealing framework based on p-bits that models key device variability factors -timing, intensity, and offset- to reflect real-world device behavior. Through CUDA-based simulations, our approach achieves a two-order magnitude speedup over CPU implementations on the MAX-CUT benchmark with problem sizes ranging from 800 to 20,000 nodes. By providing a scalable and accessible tool, this framework aims to advance research in probabilistic computing, enabling optimization applications in diverse fields.

### [16] [Stabilizing autoregressive forecasts in chaotic systems via multi-rate latent recurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14487)
*Mrigank Dhingra,Omer San*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSR-HINE用多尺度隐式预测和多速率递归模块提升混沌系统长时预测性能，在两个基准上均大幅降低误差并延长可预测步数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌动力系统的长时序自回归预测易受单步误差放大和分布漂移的影响，导致物理上的不一致和统计失效，需要一种既能保留慢变量长期上下文，又能准确捕捉快变量细节的模型。

Method: MSR-HINE架构：1）在每一步使用由粗到细递归状态生成潜在先验；2）隐式一步预测器通过多尺度潜在注入细化状态；3）使用门控融合与后验潜在保证尺度一致更新；4）轻量级隐藏状态校正对齐递归记忆与融合潜在。该方法允许不同时间尺度的模块并行处理并相互校准。

Result: 在Kuramoto–Sivashinsky基准上相较于U‑Net自回归基线，MSR-HINE在跳跃H=400时RMSE降低62.8%，ACC从-0.155提升至0.828，预测可持续性阈值0.5的可预测步数从241提升至400；在Lorenz‑96基准上，H=100时RMSE下降27.0%，ACC从0.144提升至0.545，阈值0.5的可预测步数从58提升至100。

Conclusion: 通过在不同时间尺度上使用多尺度潜在先验与多速率递归模块的层级隐式预测器(MSR-HINE)，有效减小了混沌系统长时序预测中的误差累积，保持了慢动态的长期上下文与快动态的细节一致性，从而显著提升了曲线终点误差（RMSE）和相关性（ACC）指标。

Abstract: Long-horizon autoregressive forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems remains challenging due to rapid error amplification and distribution shift: small one-step inaccuracies compound into physically inconsistent rollouts and collapse of large-scale statistics. We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.

TL;DR: 对抗攻击并非总能估计随机噪声鲁棒性；通过引入浓度因子与新的攻击策略，可判断其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估对抗攻击是否能代表随机噪声下的鲁棒性，以指导安全评估。

Method: 提出概率度量，使用浓度因子κ在等方噪声与对抗方向间插值；设计对攻击策略以更贴近均匀噪声的统计区间。

Result: 在ImageNet和CIFAR-10上系统比较常用攻击，明确哪些攻击成功能真正反映噪声风险，哪些不行。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击在某些统计区间可信，可用于安全评估；但若偏离均匀噪声，对抗成功往往不代表随机鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $κ$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In decoder-only (causal) transformers, the computation graph created by causal masking routes information through both direct-path attention and indirect paths formed by intermediate tokens. We denote these indirect paths between token pairs as their runways. We argue that certain failure modes of causal transformers as observed by a growing body of recent works are likely exacerbated by a misalignment between these two information propagation modes. We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation. Our proposed methodology introduces no additional parameters and can seamlessly be integrated into standard attention mechanism. Empirically, our rewired transformer results in steady improvements in general language modeling as well as noticeably stronger information retrieval and extrapolation abilities compared to standard transformers.

*Alistair Cheong,Haolin Cong,Tyler Yang,Dustin Miao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM可在单轮更新中使用自生成模板与NTP来部分模仿人类编辑策略，归档积极性需平衡以防同质化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM搜索系统固定模型瓶颈，现有自我更新策略手工设定，需让模型根据任务反馈自动决策更新方式。

Method: 在SEAL框架中让LLM自生成self‑edit模板并选择NTP训练数据／超参，探索无归档与带归档两种策略；对Qwen3-8B在SQuAD基准进行单文段知识注入实验。

Result: 无归档方案与弱基线“Implications”相当；归档方案超越“Implications”，逼近强基线“Rewrite”，但尚未超越；归档在短期提升稳健性，却可能加速同质化。

Conclusion: 无需手工指定的动态权重更新提升搜索模型可在单轮自我改进中逼近人类设计基线性能，但未能外超；有效归档和多样性维护是提升的关键。

Abstract: Many LLM-based open-ended search systems freeze the foundation model that proposes improvements to existing solutions, which may bottleneck long-run progress. Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker "Implications" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed "Implications" and approached the strongest human-designed "Rewrite" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

### [21] [QMC: Efficient SLM Edge Inference via Outlier-Aware Quantization and Emergent Memories Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14549)
*Nilesh Prasad Pandey,Jangseon Park,Onat Gungor,Flavio Ponzina,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出QMC：无重训练量化+ReRAM+MRAM混合内存，显著提升边缘小语言模型推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI需要满足实时、隐私、内存、延迟和能耗限制，但传统量化受限于非易失性存储器的噪声和传统内存结构效率低。

Method: 采用无重训练的出类拔萃量化，并将权重划分为inlier与outlier，分别存储在多级ReRAM和高精度MRAM中，实现混合内存架构。

Result: 在语言建模和推理基准上，QMC比先进量化方法更优或等效，内存使用下降6.3~7.3倍，外部传输7.6倍，能耗11.7倍，延迟12.5倍。

Conclusion: QMC实现了在边缘设备上高效的LLM推理，显著降低内存占用、能耗和延迟，具备可部署性与可扩展性。

Abstract: Deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) on edge platforms is critical for real-time, privacy-sensitive generative AI, yet constrained by memory, latency, and energy budgets. Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.

TL;DR: Transformer+预订动态模型，门区分离，提升客流预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型活动的日常客流预测至关重要，但现有多源外部数据方法在历史数据不足时易失真，亟需一种更可靠、更易实现的预测手段。

Method: 通过构造包含入口记录与预订动态的数据集，采用编码器-解码器Transformer架构，并引入逆向式嵌入和自适应融合模块，直接利用预订行为的时间窗口动态来捕捉游客赴会意图，避免了多源外部数据的复杂集成。

Result: 实验结果表明，将东、西门分渠道独立建模可持续提升预测精度，特别是短期与中期；消融实验进一步验证了编码器-解码器结构、逆向式嵌入和自适应融合模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: 基于预订动态的Transformer框架提供了一种可行且有效的出席人数预测手段，显著提升了大型国际活动的短期与中期预测准确率，尤其是在按东、西门两通道分离时表现更佳。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of daily attendance is vital for managing transportation, crowd flows, and services at large-scale international events such as Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan. However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.

TL;DR: 微调LLM可生成高质量反事实解释，提升模型鲁棒性，优于传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的优化方法在生成可解释且可操作的反事实解释（CFEs）方面存在模型专属、可操作性有限等局限，尤其在医疗健康等高风险场景下，需更灵活、可解释且能提升模型鲁棒性的技术方法。

Method: 对大型语言模型（LLM）GPT‑4和两款开源模型BioMistral‑7B、LLaMA‑3.1‑8B进行微调，利用AI‑READI多模态临床数据集进行评估，度量干预质量、特征多样性与增强效果。对比优化基线（DiCE、CFNOW、NICE）。

Result: 微调后LLaMA‑3.1‑8B在三项指标上表现突出：可行性高达99%、有效性0.99，生成的反事实特征变化现实可操作；在标签稀缺情境下，LLM生成的CF可将分类器F1恢复平均20%。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的反事实生成提供了模型无关、语义连贯且临床可行的干预方案，显著提升模型训练效率与鲁棒性，显示出在数字健康感知系统中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) provide human-centric interpretability by identifying the minimal, actionable changes required to alter a machine learning model's prediction. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments. When used for data augmentation under controlled label-scarcity settings, LLM-generated CFs substantially restore classifier performance, yielding an average 20% F1 recovery across three scarcity scenarios. Compared with optimization-based baselines such as DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, LLMs offer a flexible, model-agnostic approach that generates more clinically actionable and semantically coherent counterfactuals. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.
  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance

Abstract: A large number of heuristics have been proposed to optimize the reinforcement fine-tuning of LLMs. However, inconsistent claims are made from time to time, making this area elusive. Reflecting on this situation, two fundamental questions still lack a clear understanding: 1) what is the role of each optimizing choice? 2) which ones are the bottlenecks? This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings. The up procedure of the experiment pipeline expanding the minimalist configuration layer by layer, examining the role of each design choice. Experimental results on three LLMs and two reasoning datasets not only reveal new understanding of the design choice but also yield essential insights to shape the area.

### [25] [Variance-Adaptive Muon: Accelerating LLM Pretraining with NSR-Modulated and Variance-Scaled Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14603)
*Jingru Li,Yibo Fan,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon‑NSR and Muon‑VS twin optimizers add variance‑adaptive momentum scaling to Muon’s orthogonal updates, delivering faster convergence and lower loss than AdamW and Muon on large‑scale LLM pretraining.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve optimizer efficiency for the computationally expensive LLM pretraining by extending the orthogonal momentum idea in Muon with variance‑adaptive techniques inspired by Adam’s sign‑update nature.


Method: Develop two Muon variants that normalize momentum with variance‑adaptive scaling—NSR modulation for Muon‑NSR and variance‑based scaling for Muon‑VS—before orthogonalizing the update.


Result: On GPT‑2 and LLaMA pretraining, both variants significantly reduce training iterations; e.g., LLaMA‑1.2B requires 1.36× fewer steps than the tuned Muon to hit the target validation loss.


Conclusion: Muon-NSR and Muon-VS not only accelerate convergence but also consistently outperform well-tuned AdamW and original Muon, producing lower validation loss across GPT‑2 and LLaMA pretraining.


Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive performance across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet pretraining is computationally demanding, making optimizer efficiency an important practical consideration. Muon accelerates LLM pretraining via orthogonal momentum updates that serve as a matrix analogue of the element-wise sign operator. Motivated by the recent perspective that Adam is a variance-adaptive sign update algorithm, we propose two variants of Muon, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS, which apply variance-adaptive normalization to momentum before orthogonalization. Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining demonstrate that our proposed methods accelerate convergence and consistently achieve lower validation loss than both competitive, well-tuned AdamW and Muon baselines. For example, on the LLaMA-1.2B model, Muon-NSR and Muon-VS reduce the iterations required to reach the target validation loss by $1.36\times$ relative to the well-tuned Muon following the recent benchmark.

Abstract: Credit default risk arises from complex interactions among borrowers, financial institutions, and transaction-level behaviors. While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories.
  We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.

Abstract: Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis.

TL;DR: FRL 通过离散排名提升鲁棒性；但新提出的 Edge Control Attack 能在不被发现的前提下精确调低对手准确率，平均误差仅 0.224%，表明 FRL 并不安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FRL 通过离散排名减少通信成本并提升对持续空间攻击的鲁棒性，但作者意识到仍有缺口，想通过提出细粒度控制攻击来揭示 FRL 的弱点。

Method: ECA 分为两阶段：第一阶段识别并操纵升序与降序边缘，以使全局模型趋向攻击者预设的目标模型；第二阶段扩大选择边界间隙以稳定全局模型在目标准确率上。

Result: 在七个基准数据集和九种拜占廷鲁棒聚合规则上，ECA 的平均误差仅为 0.224%，比基线提升高达 17 倍，显示出极强的精准攻击能力。

Conclusion: 作者发现即使在已经设计来抵御模型投毒的分布式排名学习（FRL）框架中，仍存在一种新的细粒度控制攻击——Edge Control Attack（ECA）。该攻击能在保持正常收敛轨迹的情况下，将竞争对手模型的准确率精确调节到任意目标水平，且误差极小，这表明 FRL 在安全性上存在严重缺陷，需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Chenzh0205/ECA

Abstract: Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.

Abstract: Training Large Reasoning Model (LRM) is usually unstable and unpredictable, especially on hard problems or weak foundation models. We found that the current post-training scaling strategy can still improve on these cases. We propose CoScale-RL, a novel scaling strategy with better data and computational efficiency. We first scale up solutions to make problems solvable. The core idea is to collect multiple solutions for each problem, rather than simply enlarging the dataset. Then, we scale up rollout computation to stabilize Reinforcement Learning. We further leverage a model merge technique called Re-distillation to sustain or even improve computational efficiency when scaling up. Our method significantly improves data and computational efficiency, with an average 3.76$\times$ accuracy improvement on four benchmarks. CoScale-RL is able to improve an LRM's ability boundary without an extensive SFT dataset. Our method provides a new scaling direction to further improve LRM's reasoning ability.

TL;DR: IBMDP利用案例驱动的隐式转移模型与集成MCTS规划，在药物实验测序中实现高达92%的资源节约，并在合成环境中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现尤其是神经系统疾病研究中，实验测序缺乏可重现的环境模拟器，通常只能依赖历史实验数据库进行决策，导致高风险、不确定且资源受限的规划难题。

Method: 提出隐式贝叶斯马尔可夫决策过程（IBMDP），首先构建基于相似历史结果的非参数信念分布，实现隐式转移模型；随后利用贝叶斯更新随证据积累调整信念，并采用集成蒙特卡洛树搜索（Ensemble MCTS）进行规划，以在获取信息和节约资源之间实现平衡。

Result: 在真实的神经系统药物发现任务中，IBMDP相较传统启发式方法将资源消耗降低了多达92%；在可计算最优策略的合成环境测试里，IBMDP其决策与最优策略的对齐度显著高于使用同一相似性模型的确定性值迭代方法。

Conclusion: IBMDP为数据丰富但缺乏模拟器的领域提供了一种可实践的、基于贝叶斯模型和集成规划的序贯实验设计方案。

Abstract: Optimally sequencing experimental assays in drug discovery is a high-stakes planning problem under severe uncertainty and resource constraints. A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner. IBMDP offers a practical solution for sequential experimental design in data-rich but simulator-poor domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data in edge environments, but is constrained by limited communication bandwidth and heterogeneous client data distributions. Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RefProtoFL attains higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art prototype-based FL baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Post-training pretrained Autoregressive models (ARMs) into Masked Diffusion models (MDMs) has emerged as a cost-effective strategy to overcome the limitations of sequential generation. However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic "mechanism shift" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.

Conclusion: 提出了一种利用有限差错搜索的任意时间完整方法，显著提升了在连续特征下学习最优决策树的即时性能。

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on algorithms for learning optimal decision trees, primarily in the context of binary features. Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.

Motivation: 在医疗筛查、因果学习等应用场景中，输入往往是分布，且只能获得样本而非完整分布。传统机器学习方法难以直接处理此类高阶输入，核方法提供了将分布嵌入为可处理向量的天然途径，因此需要对基于SVM的分布式输入方法进行深入理论分析。

Abstract: In supervised learning with distributional inputs in the two-stage sampling setup, relevant to applications like learning-based medical screening or causal learning, the inputs (which are probability distributions) are not accessible in the learning phase, but only samples thereof. This problem is particularly amenable to kernel-based learning methods, where the distributions or samples are first embedded into a Hilbert space, often using kernel mean embeddings (KMEs), and then a standard kernel method like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is applied, using a kernel defined on the embedding Hilbert space. In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates. Finally, some of our technical tools like a new feature space for Gaussian kernels on Hilbert spaces are of independent interest.

Abstract: On and off-ramps are understudied road sections even though they introduce a higher level of variation in highway interactions. Predicting vehicles' behavior in these areas can decrease the impact of uncertainty and increase road safety. In this paper, the difference between this Area of Interest (AoI) and a straight highway section is studied. Multi-layered LSTM architecture to train the AoI model with ExiD drone dataset is utilized. In the process, different prediction horizons and different models' workflow are tested. The results show great promise on horizons up to 4 seconds with prediction accuracy starting from about 76% for the AoI and 94% for the general highway scenarios on the maximum horizon.

Abstract: We introduce Strategic Doctrine Language Models (sdLM), a learning-system framework for multi-document strategic reasoning with doctrinal consistency constraints and calibrated uncertainty. The approach combines multi-document attention, temporal encoding, and a doctrine-consistency layer to improve long-horizon forecasting and plan plausibility while reducing severe doctrinal violations. We evaluate sdLM using (i) expert-panel scoring of strategic scenarios (N=47), (ii) doctrine consistency on 336 doctrine publications (12,847 statements), and (iii) geopolitical forecasting on 127 historical counterfactuals (1945-2020) across 12-60 month horizons. Across these benchmarks, sdLM achieves higher strategic quality and better calibration than strong general-purpose LLM baselines, and remains competitive with human experts on long-horizon judgments. We further report ablations, scaling trends, and deployment-oriented performance/latency characteristics to clarify which components drive improvements and how they translate to operational settings.

Conclusion: 量化感知训练（QAT）在推理模型中结合知识蒸馏、预训练量化初始化、强化学习以及对齐校准域可显著提升准确率和收敛速度，形成的Reasoning-QAT工作流在多种LLM和推理分类上均优于传统PTQ方法。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.

Abstract: Effective management of Type 1 Diabetes requires continuous glucose monitoring and precise insulin adjustments to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. With the growing adoption of wearable glucose monitors and mobile health applications, accurate blood glucose prediction is essential for enhancing automated insulin delivery and decision-support systems. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for personalized blood glucose prediction, leveraging patient-specific data to improve prediction accuracy and responsiveness in real-world scenarios. Unlike traditional generalized models, our method accounts for individual variability, enabling more effective subject-specific predictions. We compare Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation with a fine-tuning strategy to evaluate their ability to model patient-specific dynamics. Results show that personalized models significantly improve the prediction of adverse events, enabling more precise and timely interventions in real-world scenarios. To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging. Our findings underscore the potential of adaptive, personalized glucose prediction models for advancing next-generation diabetes management, particularly in wearable and mobile health platforms, enhancing consumer-oriented diabetes care solutions.

Conclusion: 整合外部证据与伪造特征，并结合对比学习和自适应融合，可显著提升深度语义不匹配谣言检测性能。

Abstract: Social media increasingly disseminates information through mixed image text posts, but rumors often exploit subtle inconsistencies and forged content, making detection based solely on post content difficult. Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces. A dual contrastive learning module computes contrastive losses between text image and text description pairs, improving detection of semantic inconsistencies. A gated adaptive feature-scaling fusion mechanism dynamically adjusts multimodal fusion and reduces redundancy. Experiments on Weibo and Twitter datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms mainstream baselines in macro accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

Motivation: 传统UED缺乏有效的信用分配与难度识别，尤其在大环境下表现不佳，亟需更精准的奖励与度量方法。

Method: 使用动态环境生成（DEGen）提供更稠密的关卡奖励，配合最大化负优势（MNA）的遗憾近似；通过实验评估二者在不同环境规模下的性能。

Result: MNA在遗憾近似上优于现有方法；与DEGen结合时，能够持续超越现有技巧，尤其在环境尺寸增大时表现突出。

Conclusion: DEGen与MNA的结合显著提升了UED在大规模环境中的表现，证明了更稠密的奖励信号与更优的遗憾近似能解决信用分配难题并提高生成更具挑战性的关卡。

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) seeks to automatically generate training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, with the goal of improving generalisation and zero-shot performance. However, designing effective curricula remains a difficult problem, particularly in settings where small subsets of environment parameterisations result in significant increases in the complexity of the required policy. Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes. We also introduce a new regret approximation, Maximised Negative Advantage (MNA), as a significantly improved metric to optimise for, that better identifies more challenging levels. We show empirically that MNA outperforms current regret approximations and when combined with DEGen, consistently outperforms existing methods, especially as the size of the environment grows. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/Dynamic-Environment-Generation-for-UED.

Conclusion: 通过将时间序列分类转化为多模态生成任务，并借助语言模型生成文本标签，InstructTime框架能够更好地利用上下文信息与类之间的语义关系；在此基础上，InstructTime++引入隐式特征挖掘进一步提升了模型的表现。

Abstract: Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.

Conclusion: FG‑Trac实现了细粒度、可验证的样本追踪，为数据治理与合规提供技术基础

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems are increasingly realised as multistage pipelines, yet existing transparency mechanisms typically operate at a model level: they describe what a system is and why it behaves as it does, but not how individual data samples are operationally recorded, tracked, and verified as they traverse the pipeline. This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.

Abstract: Identifying combinations of players (that is, lineups) in basketball - and other sports - that perform well when they play together is one of the most important tasks in sports analytics. One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.

Abstract: Batch inference workloads for causal transformer models frequently process sequences that share common prefixes, such as system prompts, few-shot examples, or shared queries. Standard inference engines treat each sequence independently, redundantly recomputing identical MLP activations for every copy of the shared prefix. We introduce RadixMLP, a technique that exploits the position-wise nature of MLPs, LayerNorms, linear projections, and embeddings to eliminate this redundancy. RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries. RadixMLP is stateless and operates within a single forward pass. In end-to-end serving benchmarks on MS~MARCO v1.1 with Qwen3 models (0.6B to 8B parameters), RadixMLP achieves 1.44-1.59$\times$ speedups in realistic reranking workloads, with up to $5\times$ speedups on synthetic benchmarks with longer shared prefixes. Our code is available at https://github.com/michaelfeil/radix-mlp.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in active flow control (AFC), yet progress in the field remains difficult to assess as existing studies rely on heterogeneous observation and actuation schemes, numerical setups, and evaluation protocols. Current AFC benchmarks attempt to address these issues but heavily rely on external computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, are not fully differentiable, and provide limited 3D and multi-agent support. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FluidGym, the first standalone, fully differentiable benchmark suite for RL in AFC. Built entirely in PyTorch on top of the GPU-accelerated PICT solver, FluidGym runs in a single Python stack, requires no external CFD software, and provides standardized evaluation protocols. We present baseline results with PPO and SAC and release all environments, datasets, and trained models as public resources. FluidGym enables systematic comparison of control methods, establishes a scalable foundation for future research in learning-based flow control, and is available at https://github.com/safe-autonomous-systems/fluidgym.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于课程学习的深度强化学习框架在实现电动车辆路由问题（EVRPTW）时，显著提升了训练稳定性、收敛性与泛化性能，并在大规模实例上表现出卓越的可行性和竞争性的解质量。

Abstract: The electric vehicle routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW) is a complex optimization problem in sustainable logistics, where routing decisions must minimize total travel distance, fleet size, and battery usage while satisfying strict customer time constraints. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of deep learning systems requires systematic evaluation of their reliability in real-world scenarios. Traditional gradient-based adversarial attacks introduce small perturbations that rarely correspond to realistic failures and mainly assess robustness rather than functional behavior. Generative test generation methods offer an alternative but are often limited to simple datasets or constrained input domains. Although diffusion models enable high-fidelity image synthesis, their computational cost and limited controllability restrict their applicability to large-scale testing. We present HyNeA, a generative testing method that enables direct and efficient control over diffusion-based generation. HyNeA provides dataset-free controllability through hypernetworks, allowing targeted manipulation of the generative process without relying on architecture-specific conditioning mechanisms or dataset-driven adaptations such as fine-tuning. HyNeA employs a distinct training strategy that supports instance-level tuning to identify failure-inducing test cases without requiring datasets that explicitly contain examples of similar failures. This approach enables the targeted generation of realistic failure cases at substantially lower computational cost than search-based methods. Experimental results show that HyNeA improves controllability and test diversity compared to existing generative test generators and generalizes to domains where failure-labeled training data is unavailable.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale Earth system models are essential for capturing local climate change. However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields. The model can simultaneously learn internal variability from abundant low-resolution data and fine-scale physics from sparse high-resolution data. Our work bridges the gap between the high volume of low-resolution ensemble statistics and the scarcity of high-resolution physical detail.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a frontier in graph learning, which are expected to deliver transferable representations across diverse tasks. However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence. Extensive experiments on five benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that RAG-GFM consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines in both cross-domain node and graph classification, achieving superior effectiveness and efficiency.

Motivation: 在参数受限的大模型中，探索阶段频繁出现执行失败，导致轨迹嘈杂、信用分配困难，现有密集奖励易出现报奖，超采样成本高昂，迫切需要更高效的轨迹净化方案。

Method: 采用Similarity‑Aware Adaptive Rollback（SAAR）对失败执行进行自适应回滚，将错误轨迹替换为成功自纠错，从而构建干净的训练样本；随后在这些自净化路径上进行模型训练。

Result: 在AIME24/25、GPQA和LiveCodeBench三组基准上，CLEANER平均提升准确率6%、3%和5%；并在仅使用三分之一训练步数的情况下达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: CLEANER通过自我纠错机制净化训练轨迹，显著提升参数受限模型的agentic RL性能，并以三分之一的训练步数实现与最先进方法相当的表现。

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize tools like Python interpreters for complex problem-solving. However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

Method: 对单层Transformer在合成图遍历任务中的梯度流进行严格分析，并证明其收敛至可解释的逐顶点遍历算法；随后在合成数据和数学推理任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 理论证明与实验一致：模型在足够多简单实例的训练分布下能学习到可泛化的遍历策略；若缺失，则学习阻塞。

Conclusion: 在梯度流推动下，单层Transformer可自发学习到链式推理的迭代算法，并在足够多的“简单实例”支持下实现可推断到更长链的通用策略；若缺乏这些简单实例，则梯度学习不可行。

Abstract: Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.

Conclusion: ZENITH实现了零额外计算的自适应学习率调度，兼容正则化且在多任务上均显著提升性能，降低训练成本。

Abstract: Training deep computer vision models requires manual oversight or hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate (LR) schedule. While existing adaptive optimizers schedule the LR automatically, they suffer from computational and memory overhead, incompatibility with regularization, and suboptimal LR choices. In this work, we introduce the ZENITH (Zero-overhead Evolution using Norm-Informed Training History) optimizer, which adapts the LR using the temporal evolution of the gradient norm. Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines. It also yielded superior mAP in object detection, keypoint detection, and instance segmentation on MS COCO using the R-CNN family of models. Furthermore, its compatibility with regularization enables even better generalization.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML now regularly receive tens of thousands of submissions, posing significant challenges to maintaining the quality and consistency of the peer review process. This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.

Abstract: A molecule's properties are fundamentally determined by its composition and structure encoded in its molecular graph. Thus, reasoning about molecular properties requires the ability to parse and understand the molecular graph. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to chemistry, tackling tasks such as molecular name conversion, captioning, text-guided generation, and property or reaction prediction. Most existing benchmarks emphasize general chemical knowledge, rely on literature or surrogate labels that risk leakage or bias, or reduce evaluation to multiple-choice questions. We introduce MolecularIQ, a molecular structure reasoning benchmark focused exclusively on symbolically verifiable tasks. MolecularIQ enables fine-grained evaluation of reasoning over molecular graphs and reveals capability patterns that localize model failures to specific tasks and molecular structures. This provides actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current chemistry LLMs and guides the development of models that reason faithfully over molecular structure.

Abstract: Phase synchronization among distributed transmission reception points (TRPs) is a prerequisite for enabling coherent joint transmission and high-precision sensing in millimeter wave (mmWave) cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper proposes a bidirectional calibration scheme and a calibration coefficient estimation method for phase synchronization, and presents a calibration coefficient phase tracking method using unilateral uplink/downlink channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, this paper introduces the use of reciprocity calibration to eliminate non-ideal factors in sensing and leverages sensing results to achieve calibration coefficient phase tracking in dynamic scenarios, thus enabling bidirectional empowerment of both communication and sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively implement reciprocal calibration with lower overhead, enabling coherent collaborative transmission, and resolving non-ideal factors to acquire lower sensing error in sensing applications. Experimental results show that, in the mmWave band, over-the-air (OTA) bidirectional calibration enables coherent collaborative transmission for both collaborative TRPs and collaborative user equipments (UEs), achieving beamforming gain and long-time coherent sensing capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate channel estimation with low pilot overhead and computational complexity is key to efficiently utilizing multi-antenna wireless systems. Motivated by the evolution from purely statistical descriptions toward physics- and geometry-aware propagation models, this work focuses on incorporating channel information into a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework for improving the channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a GPR-based channel estimation framework along with a novel Spatial-correlation (SC) kernel that explicitly captures the channel's second-order statistics. We derive a closed-form expression of the proposed SC-based GPR estimator and prove that its posterior mean is optimal in terms of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) under the same second-order statistics, without requiring the underlying channel distribution to be Gaussian. Our analysis reveals that, with up to 50% pilot overhead reduction, the proposed method achieves the lowest normalized mean-square error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and superior preservation of spectral efficiency compared to benchmark estimators, while maintaining lower computational complexity than the conventional MMSE estimator.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are pivotal in the applications such as disaster relief, aerial base station (BS) and logistics transportation. These scenarios require the capabilities in accurate sensing, efficient communication and flexible control for real-time and reliable task execution. However, sensing, communication and control are studied independently in traditional research, which limits the overall performance of UAV swarms. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a deeply coupled scheme of integrated sensing, communication and control (ISCC) for UAV swarms, which is a systemic paradigm that transcends traditional isolated designs of sensing, communication and control by establishing a tightly-coupled closed-loop through the co-optimization of sensing, communication and control. In this article, we firstly analyze the requirements of scenarios and key performance metrics. Subsequently, the enabling technologies are proposed, including communication-and-control-enhanced sensing, sensing-and-control-enhanced communication, and sensing-and-communication-enhanced control. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed ISCC framework, demonstrating its application potential in the future.

Abstract: Two-dimensional mass spectrometry (2D MS) is a method for tandem mass spectrometry that enables the correlation between precursor and fragment ions without the need for ion isolation. On a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer, the phase correction functions for absorption mode data processing were found to be linear in the precursor ion dimension and quadratic in the fragment ion dimension. Absorption mode data processing on limited data sets has previously shown improvements in signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power by a factor of 2. Here, we have expanded absorption mode data processing to 2D mass spectra regardless of size and frequency range. We have applied absorption mode 2D MS to top-down analysis of variously oxidized ubiquitin proteoforms generated by fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and to an extract of ergot alkaloids. We show that absorption mode data processing significantly improves both the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of the 2D mass spectrum compared to standard magnitude mode in terms of sequence coverage in top-down proteomics, as well as the accuracy of precursor-fragment correlation in metabolomics.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a secured dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system aided by movable antennas. To enhance the communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmitter beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) and transmission covertness constraints. We consider multiple Willies operating in both non-colluding and colluding modes. For noncolluding Willies, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation procedure to reformulate the challenging optimization problem into a more tractable form. Subsequently, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), Dinkelbach transformation, and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to tackle the resulting problem. For colluding Willies, we first derive the minimum detection error probability (DEP) by characterizing the optimal detection statistic, which is proven to follow the generalized Erlang distribution. Then, we develop a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based algorithm to address the colluding detection problem. We further provide a comprehensive complexity analysis on the unified design framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a superior balance between communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Future wireless systems are expected to employ a substantially larger number of transmit ports for channel state information (CSI) estimation compared to current specifications. Although scaling ports improves spectral efficiency, it also increases the resource overhead to transmit reference signals across the time-frequency grid, ultimately reducing achievable data throughput. In this work, we propose an deep learning (DL)-based CSI reconstruction framework that serves as an enabler for reliable CSI acquisition in future 6G systems. The proposed solution involves designing a port-cycling mechanism that sequentially sounds different portions of CSI ports across time, thereby lowering the overhead while preserving channel observability. The proposed CSI Adaptive Network (CsiAdaNet) model exploits the resulting sparse measurements and captures both spatial and temporal correlations to accurately reconstruct the full-port CSI. The simulation results show that our method achieves overhead reduction while maintaining high CSI reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Modulation constellation design is a core challenge in digital communications, especially under stringent demands on spectral efficiency, robustness, and energy consumption. Classical schemes like PSK and QAM, while analytically tractable, often lose optimality under realistic channels and nonlinear hardware constraints. This paper provides a unified study of constellation design from geometric, probabilistic, optimization, and machine learning perspectives, focusing on symbol error rate (SER), fading robustness, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and energy efficiency. We evaluate classical, lattice-based, asymmetric, probabilistically shaped, Golden Angle, heuristic-optimized, and machine learning assisted constellations under AWGN and Rayleigh fading via large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Incorporating PAPR-aware and power amplifier models reveals that SER-optimal designs are not always energy-optimal; small SER trade-offs can yield substantial energy savings. Machine learning approaches offer flexible joint optimization of reliability, robustness, and energy efficiency by embedding channel and hardware constraints into the learning objective.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了移动EEG能够在动态多感官听觉环境中可靠追踪选择性注意力，为未来大规模实时注意力跟踪应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Everyday communication is dynamic and multisensory, often involving shifting attention, overlapping speech and visual cues. Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.

Abstract: This chapter focuses on active sensing using sparse arrays. In active sensing applications, such as radar, sonar, wireless communications, and medical ultrasound, a collection of sensors probes the environment by emitting self-generated energy. A key benefit of such active multi-sensor arrays is their ability to focus and steer energy in desired directions by beamforming on transmit. Sparse sensor arrays offer several advantages over conventional uniform arrays, including improved resolution using fewer physical sensors and the capability to identify more scatterers than sensors. This is facilitated by the effective transmit-receive virtual array known as the sum co-array, which can have many more virtual sensors than the number of physical transmit or receive sensors. Herein, we focus on the design of low-redundancy sparse array configurations and on employing transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) beamforming using sparse arrays. We discuss the optimal, but computationally intractable Minimum-redundancy array, and a scalable symmetric array framework, which extends many well-known passive sparse array geometries to the active case. We also examine mitigating side lobes arising from spatial undersampling by a synthetic beamforming method known as image addition. We briefly present approaches for finding the physical beamforming weights synthesizing a desired Tx-Rx beampattern, and consider related spatio-temporal trade-offs. We conclude by discussing selected applications of sparse arrays in active sensing.

Abstract: One of the key features of sixth generation (6G) mobile communications will be integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept, and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value.

Conclusion: RSSA+算法在可扩展性与接近ILP性能方面表现最好，证明了高级约束感知算法优于简单启发式方法。

Abstract: As mobile networks transition toward 5G and 6G RAN architectures, Passive Optical Networks (PONs) offer a critical solution for cost-effective fronthaul transport. However, the lack of standardized evaluation models in current literature makes an objective comparison of diverse optimization strategies difficult. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a unified benchmarking framework that standardizes cost catalogs and deployment scenarios. We formulate the network design problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to establish optimality bounds and evaluate three scalable heuristic strategies: a Genetic Algorithm, K-Means Clustering (KMC+), and a graph-based Randomized Successive Splitter Assignment (RSSA+) algorithm. Simulation results show that a time-limited ILP remains a strong reference point, even when optimality is not reached. Despite being rarely used in prior fronthaul planning studies, it consistently yields solutions superior to those produced by standard heuristic methods. Among scalable approaches, RSSA+ reliably attains near-ILP performance while ensuring feasibility across all evaluated scenarios, which underscores the importance of advanced, constraint-aware algorithmic designs over simpler heuristics. The complete benchmarking framework and datasets are publicly shared in [1].

Conclusion: 阶梯机制在加法式 ε-差分隐私机制中具有普遍最优性，这为设计隐私机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the optimal design of additive mechanisms for vector-valued queries under $ε$-differential privacy (DP). Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $ε$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $ε$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy.

Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of signals with sublinear sparsity sent over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. This fundamental problem arises in designing denoisers used in message-passing algorithms for sublinear sparsity. The main results are direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity grows sublinearly in the signal dimension as the signal dimension tends to infinity. As a direct theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator is proved to achieve vanishing square error in the sublinear sparsity limit if the noise variance is smaller than a threshold. As a converse theorem, all estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than the signal power under a mild condition if the noise variance is larger than another threshold. In particular, the two thresholds coincide with each other when non-zero signals have constant amplitude. These results imply the asymptotic optimality of an existing separable Bayesian estimator used in approximate message-passing for sublinear sparsity.

Abstract: Emerging applications in manufacturing, wireless communication, and molecular data storage require robust coding schemes that remain effective under physical distortions where codewords may be arbitrarily fragmented and partially missing. To address such challenges, we propose a new family of error-correcting codes, termed $(t,s)$-break-resilient codes ($(t,s)$-BRCs). A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework. We develop a theoretical foundation for $(t,s)$-BRCs, including a formal adversarial channel model, lower bounds on the necessary redundancy, and explicit code constructions that approach these bounds.

Abstract: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) have emerged as a revolutionary architecture for next-generation wireless communications, offering wave-domain signal processing capabilities with significantly reduced hardware complexity compared to conventional systems. However, most existing SIM research assumes continuous phase shifts and perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which are impractical due to hardware discrete phase shift constraints and prohibitive pilot overhead. This paper presents a joint power allocation and discrete phase shift optimization framework for SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output(MISO) downlink systems under statistical CSI. We formulate the achievable sum rate maximization problem considering practical discrete phase constraints and derive a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate under statistical CSI. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we decouple the problem by using the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm and alternating optimization (AO). Subsequently, we utilize the Lagrangian multiplier method and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to obtain closed-form iterative solutions. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor of 50 compared to semi-definite relaxation (SDR) methods, , while maintaining over 85% of the continuous phase shift performance with only 1-bit quantization, highlighting its feasibility for low-cost hardware systems.

Abstract: Inference and learning are commonly cast in terms of optimisation, yet the fundamental constraints governing uncertainty reduction remain unclear. This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $Φ$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $Φ$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $Φ$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems.

Motivation: 满足6G关键指标，传统OFDM在高多普勒和多径环境下性能受限，而OTFS在延迟-多普勒域天然具备抗干扰优势。

Conclusion: OTFS为6G无线环境提供了可行且具有潜在优势的取代方案，未来需要进一步验证与优化。

Abstract: The standardization of the sixth-generation (6G) has recently commenced to address the rapidly growing demands for enhanced wireless network services. Nevertheless, existing wireless systems, particularly at the physical layer waveform level, remain inadequate for achieving the ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) envisioned for 6G. Specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the widely adopted waveform in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) networks, suffers from inherent limitations in satisfying these stringent requirements. In practice, OFDM can experience severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in a pronounced data rate error floor caused by high Doppler shifts. Additionally, the repetitive usage of cyclic prefixes (CPs), intended to combat multipath delays, results in significant spectral inefficiency. These fundamental drawbacks pose critical obstacles to fulfilling 6G performance objectives. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a promising waveform candidate, addressing the aforementioned challenges by exploiting the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Unlike OFDM, OTFS is inherently resilient to channel distortions induced by delay and Doppler effects, while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. Such intrinsic properties are instrumental in enabling OTFS, with joint communication and sensing capabilities, to embrace, rather than combat, dynamic channel conditions. Motivated by these compelling advantages, this article investigates the feasibility and practical implementation of OTFS modulation leveraging the current OFDM-based wireless systems.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于延迟-多普勒域特性的跨域通道估计算法，能够在OFDM系统中实现更精准的通道估计。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain channel estimation (CDCE) algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, leveraging the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Specifically, the proposed algorithm transforms the time-frequency (TF) domain pilot sequence of OFDM into the DD domain and applies a two-dimensional (2D) twisted-convolution for acquiring a coarse estimation of the underlying channel delay and Doppler. Then, the OFDM channel estimation is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in the TF domain according to the dictionary derived based on the obtained delay and Doppler estimates. Furthermore, a low-complexity $\ell_1$-regularized least-square estimator is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Moreover, we further develop a performance analysis framework of the proposed scheme based on the ambiguity function (AF) of the adopted pilot sequence. Our numerical results demonstrate noticeable estimation performance improvement compared to conventional OFDM channel estimation methods, particularly in the presence of high channel mobility.

Abstract: The AI era has ushered in Large Language Models (LLM) to the technological forefront, which has been much of the talk in 2023, and is likely to remain as such for many years to come. LLMs are the AI models that are the power house behind generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. These AI models, fueled by vast amounts of data and computational prowess, have unlocked remarkable capabilities, from human-like text generation to assisting with natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. They have quickly become the foundation upon which countless applications and software services are being built, or at least being augmented with. However, as with any groundbreaking innovations, the rise of LLMs brings forth critical safety, privacy, and ethical concerns. These models are found to have a propensity to leak private information, produce false information, and can be coerced into generating content that can be used for nefarious purposes by bad actors, or even by regular users unknowingly. Implementing safeguards and guardrailing techniques is imperative for applications to ensure that the content generated by LLMs are safe, secure, and ethical. Thus, frameworks to deploy mechanisms that prevent misuse of these models via application implementations is imperative. In this study, wepropose a Flexible Adaptive Sequencing mechanism with trust and safety modules, that can be used to implement safety guardrails for the development and deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Network defenders face a steady stream of attacks, observed as raw Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts. The sheer volume of alerts demands prioritization, typically based on high-level risk classifications. This work expands the scope of risk measurement by examining alerts not only through their technical characteristics but also by examining and classifying their temporal patterns. One critical issue in responding to intrusion alerts is determining whether an alert is part of an escalating attack pattern or an opportunistic scan. To identify the former, we apply extreme-regime forecasting methods from financial modeling to IDS data. Extreme-regime forecasting is designed to identify likely future high-impact events or significant shifts in system behavior. Using these methods, we examine attack patterns by computing per-minute alert intensity, volatility, and a short-term momentum measure derived from weighted moving averages.
  We evaluate the efficacy of a supervised learning model for forecasting future escalation patterns using these derived features. The trained model identifies future high-intensity attacks and demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving approximately 91\% accuracy, 89\% recall, and 98\% precision. Our contributions provide a temporal measurement framework for identifying future high-intensity attacks and demonstrate the presence of predictive early-warning signals within the temporal structure of IDS alert streams. We describe our methods in sufficient detail to enable reproduction using other IDS datasets. In addition, we make the trained models openly available to support further research. Finally, we introduce an interpretable visualization that enables defenders to generate early predictive warnings of elevated volumetric arrival risk.

Motivation: Image transmission and processing systems in resource-critical applications face significant challenges from adversarial perturbations that compromise mission-specific object classification.

Method: DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision by using scenario-aware trigger function and explainable AI to locate influential pixel regions.

Result: Temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: Provides practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in real-time resource-constrained applications, improving mission success.

Abstract: Image transmission and processing systems in resource-critical applications face significant challenges from adversarial perturbations that compromise mission-specific object classification. Current robustness testing methods require excessive computational resources through exhaustive frame-by-frame processing and full-image perturbations, proving impractical for large-scale deployments where massive image streams demand immediate processing. This paper presents DDSA (Dual-Domain Strategic Attack), a resource-efficient adversarial robustness testing framework that optimizes testing through temporal selectivity and spatial precision. We introduce a scenario-aware trigger function that identifies critical frames requiring robustness evaluation based on class priority and model uncertainty, and employ explainable AI techniques to locate influential pixel regions for targeted perturbation. Our dual-domain approach achieves substantial temporal-spatial resource conservation while maintaining attack effectiveness. The framework enables practical deployment of comprehensive adversarial robustness testing in resource-constrained real-time applications where computational efficiency directly impacts mission success.

Conclusion: 该框架兼顾高准确率、可解释性与低计算量，能够在真实环境中安全、可靠地部署至资源受限的物联网设备，克服了传统 IDS 牺牲性能或不可解释的缺陷。

Abstract: The increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has tremendously increased the attack surface of cyber threats thus making a strong intrusion detection system (IDS) with a clear explanation of the process essential towards resource-constrained environments. Nevertheless, current IoT IDS systems are usually traded off with detection quality, model elucidability, and computational effectiveness, thus the deployment on IoT devices. The present paper counteracts these difficulties by suggesting an explainable AI (XAI) framework based on an optimized Decision Tree classifier with both local and global importance methods: SHAP values that estimate feature attribution using local explanations, and Morris sensitivity analysis that identifies the feature importance in a global view. The proposed system attains the state of art on the test performance with 99.91% accuracy, F1-score of 99.51% and Cohen Kappa of 0.9960 and high stability is confirmed by a cross validation mean accuracy of 98.93%. Efficiency is also enhanced in terms of computations to provide faster inferences compared to those that are generalized in ensemble models. SrcMac has shown as the most significant predictor in feature analyses according to SHAP and Morris methods. Compared to the previous work, our solution eliminates its major drawback lack because it allows us to apply it to edge devices and, therefore, achieve real-time processing, adhere to the new regulation of transparency in AI, and achieve high detection rates on attacks of dissimilar classes. This combination performance of high accuracy, explainability, and low computation make the framework useful and reliable as a resource-constrained IoT security problem in real environments.

Method: 提出SILENTDRIFT黑盒后门攻击，利用Smootherstep函数生成C2连续扰动，确保轨迹边界速度加速度为零；采用关键帧攻击策略，仅污染关键接近阶段以降低触发曝光并最大化影响。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，攻击成功率93.2%，毒化率低于2%，且任务完成率保持95.3%。

Conclusion: SILENTDRIFT能在不显著影响视觉轨迹的前提下，利用VLA系统的内在漏洞实现高成功率的后门攻击，为未来安全评估提供重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical robotic applications, yet their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. We identify a fundamental security flaw in modern VLA systems: the combination of action chunking and delta pose representations creates an intra-chunk visual open-loop. This mechanism forces the robot to execute K-step action sequences, allowing per-step perturbations to accumulate through integration. We propose SILENTDRIFT, a stealthy black-box backdoor attack exploiting this vulnerability. Our method employs the Smootherstep function to construct perturbations with guaranteed C2 continuity, ensuring zero velocity and acceleration at trajectory boundaries to satisfy strict kinematic consistency constraints. Furthermore, our keyframe attack strategy selectively poisons only the critical approach phase, maximizing impact while minimizing trigger exposure. The resulting poisoned trajectories are visually indistinguishable from successful demonstrations. Evaluated on the LIBERO, SILENTDRIFT achieves a 93.2% Attack Success Rate with a poisoning rate under 2%, while maintaining a 95.3% Clean Task Success Rate.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely integrated into interactive systems such as dialogue agents and task-oriented assistants. This growing ecosystem also raises supply-chain risks, where adversaries can distribute poisoned models that degrade downstream reliability and user trust. Existing backdoor attacks and defenses are largely prompt-centric, focusing on user-visible triggers while overlooking structural signals in multi-turn conversations. We propose Turn-based Structural Trigger (TST), a backdoor attack that activates from dialogue structure, using the turn index as the trigger and remaining independent of user inputs. Across four widely used open-source LLM models, TST achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 99.52% with minimal utility degradation, and remains effective under five representative defenses with an average ASR of 98.04%. The attack also generalizes well across instruction datasets, maintaining an average ASR of 99.19%. Our results suggest that dialogue structure constitutes an important and under-studied attack surface for multi-turn LLM systems, motivating structure-aware auditing and mitigation in practice.

Conclusion: 在此研究中，作者通过在购买与销售合约的建模与验证阶段使用 Relativized Contract Language (RCL) 与 RECALL 工具，成功识别并纠正了规范冲突，随后将验证过的合约转换为 Solidity 并在 Remix IDE 中进行功能验证，证明从前期形式化验证到最终代码实现的完整流程能够提升智能合约的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Smart contracts are tools with self-execution capabilities that provide enhanced security compared to traditional contracts; however, their immutability makes post-deployment fault correction extremely complex, highlighting the need for a verification layer prior to this stage. Although formalisms such as Contract Language (CL) enable logical analyses, they prove limited in attributing responsibilities within complex multilateral scenarios. This work presents a proof of concept using the Relativized Contract Language (RCL) and the RECALL tool for the specification and verification of a purchase and sale contract involving multiple agents. The study demonstrates the tool's capability to detect normative conflicts during the modeling phase. After correcting logical inconsistencies, the contract was translated into Solidity and functionally validated within the Remix IDE environment, confirming that prior formal verification is fundamental to ensuring the reliability and security of the final code.

Abstract: As the expansion of IoT connectivity continues to provide quality- of-life improvements around the world, they simultaneously intro- duce increasing privacy and security concerns. The lack of a clear definition in managing shared and protected access to IoT sensors offer channels by which devices can be compromised and sensitive data can be leaked. In recent years, WebAssembly has received con- siderable attention for its efficient application sandboxing suitable for embedded systems, making it a prime candidate for exploring a secure and portable sensor interface. This paper introduces the first WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extension offering a secure, portable, and low-footprint sandbox enabling multi-tenant access to sensor data across het- erogeneous embedded devices. The runtime extensions provide application memory isolation, ensure appropriate resource privi- leges by intercepting sensor access, and offer an MQTT-SN interface enabling in-network access control. When targeting the WebAssem- bly byte-code with the associated runtime extensions implemented atop the Zephyr RTOS, our evaluation of sensor access indicates a latency overhead of 6% with an additional memory footprint of 5% when compared to native execution. As MQTT-SN requests are dominated by network delays, the WASI-SN implementation of MQTT-SN introduces less than 1% additional latency with similar memory footprint.

Abstract: Robust access control is a cornerstone of secure software, systems, and networks. An access control mechanism is as effective as the policy it enforces. However, authoring effective policies that satisfy desired properties such as the principle of least privilege is a challenging task even for experienced administrators, as evidenced by many real instances of policy misconfiguration. In this paper, we set out to address this pain point by proposing Restricter, which automatically tightens each (permit) policy rule of a policy with respect to an access log, which captures some already exercised access requests and their corresponding access decisions (i.e., allow or deny). Restricter achieves policy tightening by reducing the number of access requests permitted by a policy rule without sacrificing the functionality of the underlying system it is regulating. We implement Restricter for Amazon's Cedar policy language and demonstrate its effectiveness through two realistic case studies.

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated provisioning of large-scale cloud and on-premise environments, reducing the need for repetitive manual setup. However, this automation is a double-edged sword: a single misconfiguration in IaC scripts can propagate widely, leading to severe system downtime and security risks. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain security smells--bad coding patterns that may introduce vulnerabilities--and have proposed static analyzers based on symbolic rules to detect them. Yet, our preliminary analysis reveals that rule-based detection alone tends to over-approximate, producing excessive false positives and increasing the burden of manual inspection. In this paper, we present IntelliSA, an intelligent static analyzer for IaC security smell detection that integrates symbolic rules with neural inference. IntelliSA applies symbolic rules to over-approximate potential smells for broad coverage, then employs neural inference to filter false positives. While an LLM can effectively perform this filtering, reliance on LLM APIs introduces high cost and latency, raises data governance concerns, and limits reproducibility and offline deployment. To address the challenges, we adopt a knowledge distillation approach: an LLM teacher generates pseudo-labels to train a compact student model--over 500x smaller--that learns from the teacher's knowledge and efficiently classifies false positives. We evaluate IntelliSA against two static analyzers and three LLM baselines (Claude-4, Grok-4, and GPT-5) using a human-labeled dataset including 241 security smells across 11,814 lines of real-world IaC code. Experimental results show that IntelliSA achieves the highest F1 score (83%), outperforming baselines by 7-42%. Moreover, IntelliSA demonstrates the best cost-effectiveness, detecting 60% of security smells while inspecting less than 2% of the codebase.

Abstract: This work addresses the computational challenge of enforcing privacy for agentic Large Language Models (LLMs), where privacy is governed by the contextual integrity framework. Indeed, existing defenses rely on LLM-mediated checking stages that add substantial latency and cost, and that can be undermined in multi-turn interactions through manipulation or benign-looking conversational scaffolding. Contrasting this background, this paper makes a key observation: internal representations associated with privacy-violating intent can be separated from benign requests using linear structure. Using this insight, the paper proposes NeuroFilter, a guardrail framework that operationalizes contextual integrity by mapping norm violations to simple directions in the model's activation space, enabling detection even when semantic filters are bypassed. The proposed filter is also extended to capture threats arising during long conversations using the concept of activation velocity, which measures cumulative drift in internal representations across turns. A comprehensive evaluation across over 150,000 interactions and covering models from 7B to 70B parameters, illustrates the strong performance of NeuroFilter in detecting privacy attacks while maintaining zero false positives on benign prompts, all while reducing the computational inference cost by several orders of magnitude when compared to LLM-based agentic privacy defenses.

However, due to the characteristic of sequential generation of ARMs, the stegotext generated by ARM-based PSLS methods will produce serious error propagation once it changes, making existing methods unavailable under an active tampering attack. To address this, we propose a robust, provably secure linguistic steganography with diffusion language models (DLMs). Unlike ARMs, DLMs can generate text in a partially parallel manner, allowing us to find robust positions for steganographic embedding that can be combined with error-correcting codes. Furthermore, we introduce error correction strategies, including pseudo-random error correction and neighborhood search correction, during steganographic extraction. Theoretical proof and experimental results demonstrate that our method is secure and robust. It can resist token ambiguity in stegotext segmentation and, to some extent, withstand token-level attacks of insertion, deletion, and substitution.

Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing poses a fundamental threat to current public key cryptographic systems. This threat is necessitating a transition to quantum resistant cryptographic alternatives in all the applications. In this work, we present the implementation of a practical hybrid end-to-end encryption system that combines classical and post-quantum cryptographic primitives to achieve both security and efficiency. Our system employs CRYSTALS-Kyber, a NIST-standardized lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism, for quantum-safe key exchange, coupled with AES-256-GCM for efficient authenticated symmetric encryption and SHA-256 for deterministic key derivation. The architecture follows a zero-trust model where a relay server facilitates communication without accessing plaintext messages or cryptographic keys. All encryption and decryption operations occur exclusively at client endpoints. The system demonstrates that NIST standardized post-quantum cryptography can be effectively integrated into practical messaging systems with acceptable performance characteristics, offering protection against both classical and quantum adversaries. As our focus is on implementation rather than on novelty, we also provide an open-source implementation to facilitate reproducibility and further research in post quantum secure communication systems.

Abstract: Verifiable delegation in digital identity systems remains unresolved across centralized, federated, and self-sovereign identity (SSI) environments, particularly where both human users and autonomous AI agents must exercise and transfer authority without exposing primary credentials or private keys. We introduce a unified framework that enables bounded, auditable, and least-privilege delegation across heterogeneous identity ecosystems. The framework includes four key elements: Delegation Grants (DGs), first-class authorization artefacts that encode revocable transfers of authority with enforced scope reduction; a Canonical Verification Context (CVC) that normalizes verification requests into a single structured representation independent of protocols or credential formats; a layered reference architecture that separates trust anchoring, credential and proof validation, policy evaluation, and protocol mediation via a Trust Gateway; and an explicit treatment of blockchain anchoring as an optional integrity layer rather than a structural dependency. Together, these elements advance interoperable delegation and auditability and provide a foundation for future standardization, implementation, and integration of autonomous agents into trusted digital identity infrastructures.

Motivation: 解决现有区块链（比特币、以太坊等）中缺乏有效的Mempool审计方案，缓解交易被拦截、摆位攻击的问题

Method: 对Mempool审计与恶意矿工的交互进行理论与实验分析，计算误判概率，提供审计成功条件

Result: 误判概率>25%；在所有观察者收到且交易间隔≥30秒时，审计成功率99.9%；证明批量顺序公平方案仅在有限交易中提供强公平性

Conclusion: Mempool审计并非万能方案，对特定设置存在高误判风险；需结合观测一致性与时间间隔保证审计可靠性；现有批量公平排序在现实部署中公平性有限

Abstract: While the literature features a number of proposals to defend against transaction manipulation attacks, existing proposals are still not integrated within large blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Instead, the user community opted to rely on more practical but ad-hoc solutions (such as Mempool.space) that aim at detecting censorship and transaction displacement attacks by auditing discrepancies in the mempools of so-called observers.
  In this paper, we precisely analyze, for the first time, the interplay between mempool auditing and the ability to detect censorship and transaction displacement attacks by malicious miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our analysis shows that mempool auditing can result in mis-accusations against miners with a probability larger than 25% in some settings. On a positive note, however, we show that mempool auditing schemes can successfully audit the execution of any two transactions (with an overwhelming probability of 99.9%) if they are consistently received by all observers and sent at least 30 seconds apart from each other. As a direct consequence, our findings show, for the first time, that batch-order fair-ordering schemes can offer only strong fairness guarantees for a limited subset of transactions in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditional defenses against Deep Leakage (DL) attacks in Federated Learning (FL) primarily focus on obfuscation, introducing noise, transformations or encryption to degrade an attacker's ability to reconstruct private data. While effective to some extent, these methods often still leak high-level information such as class distributions or feature representations, and are frequently broken by increasingly powerful denoising attacks. We propose a fundamentally different perspective on FL defense: framing it as a spoofing problem.We introduce SpooFL (Figure 1), a spoofing-based defense that deceives attackers into believing they have recovered the true training data, while actually providing convincing but entirely synthetic samples from an unrelated task. Unlike prior synthetic-data defenses that share classes or distributions with the private data and thus still leak semantic information, SpooFL uses a state-of-the-art generative model trained on an external dataset with no class overlap. As a result, attackers are misled into recovering plausible yet completely irrelevant samples, preventing meaningful data leakage while preserving FL training integrity. We implement the first example of such a spoofing defense, and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art DL defenses and demonstrate that it successfully misdirects attackers without compromising model performance significantly.

Abstract: Fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) will play a key role in the upcoming fifth generation (5G) mobile networks to support decentralized applications, data analytics and management into the network itself by using a highly distributed compute model. Furthermore, increasing attention is paid to providing user-centric cybersecurity solutions, which particularly require collecting, processing and analyzing significantly large amount of data traffic and huge number of network connections in 5G networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a MEC-oriented solution in 5G mobile networks to detect network anomalies in real-time and in autonomic way. Our proposal uses deep learning techniques to analyze network flows and to detect network anomalies. Moreover, it uses policies in order to provide an efficient and dynamic management system of the computing resources used in the anomaly detection process. The paper presents relevant aspects of the deployment of the proposal and experimental results to show its performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased the scale and diversity of cyberattacks, exposing limitations in traditional intrusion detection systems. Classical machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine perform well on known attacks but require retraining to detect unseen or zero-day threats. This study investigates lightweight decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for IoT attack detection by integrating structured-to-text conversion, Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Network traffic features are transformed into compact natural-language prompts, enabling efficient adaptation under constrained hardware. Experiments on the CICIoT2023 dataset show that a QLoRA-tuned LLaMA-1B model achieves an F1-score of 0.7124, comparable to the Random Forest (RF) baseline (0.7159) for known attacks. With RAG, the system attains 42.63% accuracy on unseen attack types without additional training, demonstrating practical zero-shot capability. These results highlight the potential of retrieval-enhanced lightweight LLMs as adaptable and resource-efficient solutions for next-generation IoT intrusion detection.

Motivation: 经典AC OPF中三角耦合导致的非凸和振荡导数，使得内点法收敛缓慢或不稳定，亟需更友好的数值表示。

Method: 将电压相位耦合的三角函数用全通分式(APF)近似代替，并引入前置旋转以对齐最精确区间，从而在不破坏物理损耗以及对称性的前提下，改善雅可比和海森矩阵的条件数，使用标准内点法求解。

Result: 在25+个IEEE和PGLib测试系统（9至10,000节点）中，APF OPF实现与传统模型相当的解精度，同时显著降低求解时间，Newton 步长更大、更稳定。

Conclusion: APF OPF在保留经典AC OPF精准度的同时，通过平滑近似替换三角项，显著提升求解器效率，减少求解时间和数值不稳定性。

Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/APF-OPF}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.

Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.

Motivation: 在频率控制辅助服务市场中，信息稀缺与消费者行为异质性导致的不确定性使得传统确定性或欠校准的概率模型不适用于市场竞标，亟需可靠的预测方法。

Method: 将Monte Carlo Dropout与多种多变量Conformal Prediction相结合，构建可扩展的不确定性量化模型，并与传统MCD方法对比。

Result: 纯MCD方法系统性过度估计可用弹性并违背P90；MCD‑CP框架实现了可靠覆盖并控制保守度，在实际竞标模型中将过度竞标风险降低，满足监管可靠性约束，同时实现近70%完信息利润。

Conclusion: MCD‑CP框架能够提供校准的、可靠的预测区间，满足P90合规要求，并显著降低过度竞价风险，提升合约盈利至近70%完信息水平。

Abstract: Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.

Conclusion: 提出一个统一的两阶段风险感知分布式稳健优化(MILP)框架，用于协调AI驱动数据中心产生的高功率负荷波动，显著提升配电网对数字时代扰动的韧性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers is reshaping electricity demand patterns. This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads. This contributes a scalable planning tool for resilient, AI-integrated distribution grids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on distributed energy resources creates complex nonlinear interactions that are hard to capture with conventional optimisation; machine learning surrogates are promising but direct integration leads to non‑convex, intractable formulations.

Method: Linear programming reformulation of convexified ReLU DNNs with non‑negative weight matrices beyond the first layer.

Result: The convexified ReLU DNN yields solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based methods while improving computation time and preserving fidelity, outperforming penalty-based reformulations in a Danish tertiary capacity market case study.

Conclusion: Convexified ReLU DNNs provide a scalable, reliable, and computationally efficient way to embed learned surrogate models in optimisation for power system applications.

Abstract: The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for differential privacy over affine manifolds and validate its usefulness in the contexts of differentially private cloud-based control and average consensus. We consider differential privacy mechanisms for linear queries when the input data are constrained to lie on affine manifolds, a structural property that is assumed to be available as prior knowledge to adversaries. In this setting, the definition of neighborhood adjacency must be formulated with respect to the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds. We demonstrate that such affine-manifold constraints can fundamentally alter the attainable privacy levels relative to the unconstrained case. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which differential privacy can be realized via structured noise injection mechanisms, wherein correlated Gaussian or Laplace noise distributions, rather than i.i.d. perturbations, are calibrated to the dataset. Based on these characterizations, we develop explicit noise calibration procedures that guarantee the tight realization of any prescribed privacy budget with a matching noise magnitude. Finally, we show that the proposed framework admits direct applications to linear dynamical systems ranging from differentially private cloud-based control to privacy-preserving average consensus, all of which naturally involve affine-manifold constraints. The established theoretical results are illustrated through numerical examples.

The contribution is a novel IF expression that makes the envelope-curvature terms explicit, thus correcting the bias that affects conventional estimators used in power systems. The estimator aligns with complex-frequency (CF) kinematics and admits a geometric interpretation (curvature/torsion) without phase unwrapping. Simulations and data-driven examples demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil & gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.

Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦长期规划，缺乏针对实时运维的优化工具。泰国等新兴能源市场急需高分辨率、可持续的能源调度方法。

Conclusion: 作者提出了一种两阶段随机优化框架，在满足 24/7 无碳排放目标的前提下实现成本最小化。实验显示，该方法能在泰国现有系统（光伏、储能及多种可再生与碳基能源）中以 15 分钟粒度实现可行的运维与采购计划。

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization formulation to determine optimal operation and procurement plans for achieving a 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) compliance at minimized cost. The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.

Motivation: 传统CBF只能处理相对阶为一的安全约束，而更高阶约束导致控制器设计复杂、参数多。

Method: 提出TTCBF，利用截断泰勒展开，统一高阶安全约束，仅需一个与相对阶无关的class K函数；随后引入自适应TTCBF（aTTCBF）通过在线优化class K函数增益，降低控制参数数量并提升适应性。

Conclusion: TTCBF及其自适应变体提供了高阶安全约束的统一、参数简洁的控制方法，在保持可前进不变集的同时显著降低了设计难度与计算负担。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce safety by rendering a prescribed safe set forward invariant. However, standard CBFs are limited to safety constraints with relative degree one, while High-Order CBF (HOCBF) methods address higher relative degree at the cost of introducing a chain of auxiliary functions and multiple class K functions whose tuning scales with the relative degree. In this paper, we introduce a Truncated Taylor Control Barrier Function (TTCBF), which generalizes standard discrete-time CBFs to consider high-order safety constraints and requires only one class K function, independent of the relative degree. We also propose an adaptive variant, adaptive TTCBF (aTTCBF), that optimizes an online gain on the class K function to improve adaptability, while requiring fewer control design parameters than existing adaptive HOCBF variants. Numerical experiments in a relative-degree-six spring-mass system and a cluttered corridor navigation validate the above theoretical findings.
