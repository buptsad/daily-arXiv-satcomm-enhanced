We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability."}

These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge."}

However, this paradigm poses multiple challenges due to the heterogeneity of the devices at the edge of the network, their limited computational, communication, and energy capacities, as well as their different sensing and actuating capabilities. To address these issues, we propose an optimal scheduling approach to minimize the overall latency of a workflow application in an edge-hub-cloud cyber-physical system. We consider multiple edge devices cooperating with a hub device and a cloud server. All devices feature heterogeneous multicore processors and various sensing, actuating, or other specialized capabilities. We present a comprehensive formulation based on continuous-time mixed integer linear programming, encapsulating multiple constraints often overlooked by existing approaches. We conduct a comparative experimental evaluation between our method and a well-established and effective scheduling heuristic, which we enhanced to consider the constraints of the specific problem. The results reveal that our technique outperforms the heuristic, achieving an average latency improvement of 13.54% in a relevant real-world use case, under varied system configurations. In addition, the results demonstrate the scalability of our method under synthetic workflows of varying sizes, attaining a 33.03% average latency decrease compared to the heuristic."}

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings."}

Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems.

We present parallel continuous-time and discrete-time designs in which each node runs a local adaptive observer and exchanges information over a directed graph. For both time scales, we establish stability of the network coupling operators, prove boundedness of all internal signals, and show convergence of each node estimate to the source despite model uncertainty and disturbances. We further derive input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds that quantify robustness to bounded process noise. A key distinction is that the discrete-time design uses constant adaptive gains and per-step regressor normalization to handle sampling effects, whereas the continuous-time design does not. A unified Lyapunov framework links local observer dynamics with graph topology. Simulations on star, cyclic, and path networks corroborate the analysis, demonstrating accurate tracking, robustness, and scalability with the number of sensing nodes."}

Ensuring their correctness before deployment is thus critical for reliability. While prior verification frameworks can efficiently detect bugs for programs running on a single switch, they overlook the common interactive behaviors in distributed settings, thereby missing related bugs that can cause state inconsistencies and system failures. This paper presents Procurator, a verification framework that efficiently captures interactive behaviors in distributed in-network programs. Procurator introduces a formal model combining the actor paradigm with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), translating pipeline execution into reactive, event-driven actors and unifying their interactions as message passing. To support flexible specification of distributed properties, it provides a unified intent language. Additionally, it incorporates a semantic-aware state pruner to reduce verification complexity, thus ensuring system scalability. Evaluation results show that Procurator efficiently uncovers 10 distinct bugs caused by interactive behaviors across five real-world in-network systems. It also reduces verification time by up to 913.2x and memory consumption by up to 1.9x compared to the state-of-the-art verifier."}

Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.\n  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.\n  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.\n  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.\n  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction."}

Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE."}

There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments.

Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism.

But the increasing complexity of SEVs prompted by greater dependence on interconnected systems, autonomous capabilities and electrification, presents new challenges in cybersecurity as well as functional safety. The safety and reliability of such vehicles is paramount, as unsafe or unreliable operation in either case represents an unacceptable risk in terms of the performance of the vehicle and safety of the passenger. This paper investigates the integrated development of cybersecurity and functional safety for SEVs, emphasizing the requirement for the parallel development of these domains as components that are not treated separately. In SEVs, cybersecurity is quite crucial in order to prevent the threats of hacking, data breaches and unauthorized access to vehicle systems. Functional safety ensures that important vehicle functions (braking, steering, battery control, etc.) keep working even if some part fails. This convergence of functional safety issues with cybersecurity issues is becoming more crucial, since a security incident can result in a failure of catastrophic consequences for a functional safety system and, conversely. This paper reports the current state of cybersecurity and functional safety standards for SEVs, highlighting challenges that include the weaknesses of communication networks, the potential security threats of over-the-air updates, and the demand for real-time responsive systems for failure."}

While such arrays offer practical advantages in terms of cost and size, existing localization methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: their performance degrades significantly as the source moves into the far-field, a common challenge known as the thresholding effect. To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios.

In this work, we propose a complementary perspective to utilize recent progress on \"neural network repair\" to mitigate these security threats and repair various kinds of neural network defects (arising from different security threats) within a unified framework, offering a potential silver bullet solution to real-world scenarios. To substantially push the boundary of existing repair techniques (suffering from limitations such as lack of guarantees, limited scalability, considerable overhead, etc) in addressing more practical contexts, we propose ProRepair, a novel provable neural network repair framework driven by formal preimage synthesis and property refinement. The key intuitions are: (i) synthesizing a precise proxy box to characterize the feature space preimage, which can derive a bounded distance term sufficient to guide the subsequent repair step towards the correct outputs, and (ii) performing property refinement to enable surgical corrections and scale to more complex tasks. We evaluate ProRepair across four security threats repair tasks on six benchmarks and the results demonstrate it outperforms existing methods in effectiveness, efficiency and scalability. For point-wise repair, ProRepair corrects models while preserving performance and achieving significantly improved generalization, with a speedup of 5x to 2000x over existing provable approaches. In region-wise repair, ProRepair successfully repairs all 36 safety property violation instances (compared to 8 by the best existing method), and can handle 18x higher dimensional spaces."}

Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge.

The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines.

The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state.

The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects.

Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements."}

Our model detects disrupted RUs due to cascading failures, reacts by re-instantiating CU and DU in alternative cloud locations, and recovers service continuity by reestablishing functional chains. We formulate this recovery process as an optimization problem that maximizes post-failure network performance while considering computational and communication constraints of the infrastructure. We numerically evaluated our approach on a real-world mobile network topology under multiple failure scenarios, and demonstrated that our solution recovers up to 70% higher throughput compared to conventional resilience mechanisms."}

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme.

The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems."}

The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems amplifies these challenges, as resource-constrained IoT devices demand scalable and efficient security solutions. In this work, an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is proposed for autonomous and optimized cyber-attack detection in modern networking environments. The proposed IDS framework integrates two primary innovative techniques: Optimized Importance and Percentage-based Automated Feature Selection (OIP-AutoFS) and Optimized Performance, Confidence, and Efficiency-based Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (OPCE-CASH). These components optimize feature selection and model learning processes to strike a balance between intrusion detection effectiveness and computational efficiency. This work presents the first IDS framework that integrates all four AutoML stages and employs multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize detection effectiveness, efficiency, and confidence for deployment in resource-constrained systems. Experimental evaluations over two benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed MOO-AutoML IDS outperforms state-of-the-art IDSs, establishing a new benchmark for autonomous, efficient, and optimized security for networks. Designed to support IoT and edge environments with resource constraints, the proposed framework is applicable to a variety of autonomous cybersecurity applications across diverse networked environments."}

The scope of this study focuses on enabling the management of insurance claims in a transparent, privacy-protecting manner while maintaining the efficiency and trust level needed by the patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. To accomplish this, the proposed system adds blockchain technology to provide an unchangeable, decentralized, and auditable claim transactions ledger which enhances overall claim-related processes and trust among all stakeholders. To protect critical patient information, the framework employs homomorphic encryption a modern form of cryptography to allow authorized insurance providers to perform necessary operations like claim adjudication and reimbursement on encrypted medical records without any decryption during the process. This method significantly reduces the third-party processing privacy risk because patient data can be kept secret even when third-party processing is done. In addition, smart contracts improve automation of the most important procedures in the claim processing pipeline, which decreases manual, operational, and susceptibility towards human blunders or deceitful acts. The integration of these two transformative technologiesblockchain and homomorphic encryption represents the core contribution of this work, enabling the coexistence of transparency and privacy which are usually viewed as competing objectives in traditional systems. As a result, these technologies are expected to foster the creation of a reliable, effective, and privacy safeguarding architecture that could transform the medical claim submission systems paradigm."}

However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable. We conclude that robust methods, such as Propensity Score Matching, are essential for achieving valid causal inference from administrative data in the absence of randomization"}

NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation.

This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed.

Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits. LoopLLM introduces (1) a repetition-inducing prompt optimization that exploits autoregressive vulnerabilities to induce repetitive generation, and (2) a token-aligned ensemble optimization that aggregates gradients to improve cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments on 12 open-source and 2 commercial LLMs show that LoopLLM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 90% of the maximum output length, compared to 20% for baselines, and improving transferability by around 40% to DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash."}

We introduce SCALAR (Sparse Connectivity Assessment of Latent Activation Relationships), a benchmark measuring interaction sparsity between SAE features. We also propose \"Staircase SAEs\", using weight-sharing to limit upstream feature duplication across downstream features.

Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.\n  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models."}

However, systematic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of LLMs and LLM-based agents for security patch detection. Specifically, we investigate three methods: Plain LLM (a single LLM with a system prompt), Data-Aug LLM (data augmentation based on the Plain LLM), and the ReAct Agent (leveraging the thought-action-observation mechanism). We also evaluate the performance of both commercial and open-source LLMs under these methods and compare these results with those of existing baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the detection performance of these methods across various vulnerability types, and examine the impact of different prompting strategies and context window sizes on the results. Our findings reveal that the Data-Aug LLM achieves the best overall performance, whereas the ReAct Agent demonstrates the lowest false positive rate (FPR). Although baseline methods exhibit strong accuracy, their false positive rates are significantly higher. In contrast, our evaluated methods achieve comparable accuracy while substantially reducing the FPR. These findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of LLMs and LLM-based agents in security patch detection, highlighting their advantage in maintaining robust performance while minimizing false positive rates."}

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning."}

Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%. This elegant nonlinear-dynamics-based approach establishes a unified theory including modelling and analysis for the RDPS transient dynamics."}

In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, the proposed NPE method yields additional improvements in BER."}

FedPoP is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing secure aggregation protocols to ensure compatibility with real-world FL deployments. We provide a proof of concept implementation and an empirical evaluation under realistic client dropouts. In our prototype, FedPoP introduces 0.97 seconds of per-round overhead atop securely aggregated FL and enables a client to prove its participation/contribution to a model held by a third party in 0.0612 seconds. These results indicate FedPoP is practical for real-world deployments that require auditable participation without sacrificing privacy."}

Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure."}

In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects."}

In a concluding call to action, we encourage the technology community to openly share their PTMs so the security properties of each component are known up and down the supply chain. Technology providers proud of their security efforts can show their work for competitive advantage, and customers can ask for and evaluate PTMs rather than be told \"it's secure\" but little more. Many great products already have fine threat models, and turning those into PTMs is a relatively minor task, so we argue this should (and easily could) become the new norm."}

This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance. In addition, we conduct detailed studies on model scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interpretability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach."}

Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime."}

However, the widespread use of encryption algorithms results in significant challenges for network defenders in identifying which specific algorithms are being employed. More importantly, we find that when the plaintext distribution of test data departs from the training data, the performance of classifiers often declines significantly. This issue exposes the feature extractor's hidden dependency on plaintext features. To reduce this dependency, we adopt a method that does not learn end-to-end from ciphertext bytes. Specifically, this method is based on a set of statistical tests to compute the randomness feature of the ciphertext, and then uses the frequency distribution pattern of this feature to construct the algorithms' respective fingerprints. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high discriminative performance (e.g., AUC > 0.98) in the Canterbury Corpus dataset, which contains a diverse set of data types. Furthermore, in our cross-domain evaluation, baseline models' performance degrades significantly when tested on data with a reduced proportion of structured plaintext. In sharp contrast, our method demonstrates high robustness: performance degradation is minimal when transferring between different structured domains, and even on the most challenging purely random dataset, it maintains a high level of ranking ability (AUC > 0.90)."}

In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents.

NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation.

Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles.

A machine learning-based detection engine, trained on labelled datasets of benign and malicious activity, enables accurate threat identification with minimal false positives. Detection techniques are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for standardized threat classification. Designed for extensibility, the system includes a centralized interface for alerting and forensic analysis. Preliminary evaluation shows promising results in detecting diverse attack vectors with high accuracy and efficiency."}

To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage. This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts. Our results show that advanced machine learning approaches can substantially enhance linkage accuracy, improving AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods while offering interpretable insights to support investigative decision-making."}

The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required."}

However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments."}

A Further Step Towards Understanding Jailbreaking VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical argument for the inevitability of such inconsistency from the perspective of discrepancies between model pre-training and alignment processes. Building on the above insights, we draw inspiration from optical character recognition (OCR) capability enhancement--a core task in the pre-training phase of mainstream VLMs. Leveraging this capability, we design a simple yet highly effective VLM jailbreak method, whose performance outperforms that of SOTA baselines."}

This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advances in character-level neural architectures and practical enterprise data management challenges, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic industrial datasets at scale."}

The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution."}

The foreseen trend is that they will play an increasingly visible role in daily life, which will have to be backed by appropriate operational resources. For example, due to increasing demand, smart contracts could soon face a shortage of knowledgeable users and tools to handle them in practice. Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects. Because of a steep learning curve, the handling of smart contracts is currently performed by specialised developers mainly, and most of the research effort is focusing on smart contract security, while other aspects like usability being somewhat neglected. Specific tools would lower the entry barrier, enabling interested non-experts to create smart contracts.\n  In this paper we designed, developed and tested Blockly2Hooks, a solution towards filling this gap even in challenging scenarios such as when the smart contracts are written in an advanced language like C. With the XRP Ledger as a concrete working case, Blockly2Hooks helps interested non-experts from the community to learn smart contracts easily and adopt the technology, through leveraging well-proven teaching methodologies like Visual Programming Languages, and more specifically, the Blockly Visual Programming library from Google.

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks."}

Conversely, prevalent hardware fuzzing approaches are designed to find functional correctness bugs, but are blind to information leaks like Spectre.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and scalable approach: coverage-guided hardware-software contract fuzzing. Our methodology leverages a self-compositional framework to make information leakage directly observable as microarchitectural state divergence. The core of our contribution is a new, security-oriented coverage metric, Self-Composition Deviation (SCD), which guides the fuzzer to explore execution paths that violate the leakage contract. We implemented this approach and performed an extensive evaluation on two open-source RISC-V cores: the in-order Rocket Core and the complex out-of-order BOOM core. Our results demonstrate that coverage-guided strategies outperform unguided fuzzing and that increased microarchitectural coverage leads to a faster discovery of security vulnerabilities in the BOOM core."}

This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication."}

QLCode embeds an LLM in a synthesis loop with execution feedback, while constraining its reasoning using a custom MCP interface that allows structured interaction with a Language Server Protocol (for syntax guidance) and a RAG database (for semantic retrieval of queries and documentation). This approach allows QLCoder to generate syntactically and semantically valid security queries. We evaluate QLCode on 176 existing CVEs across 111 Java projects.

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age.

To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies."}

This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%.

SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts. The proposed SRE-Llama platform prototype has been implemented with a use case featuring a customized Open5GS 5G Core."}

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly.

We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations.

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board."}

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality."}

This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed.

To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network."}

Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone."}

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications."}

We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers.

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks."}

We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks.

A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation.

We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments."}

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI."}

Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models."}

We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels).

Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions.

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines."}

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases.

The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other.

We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking.

We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph.

A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy."}

Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for \"activity cliff\" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery."}

In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy.

Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods."}

In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance.

To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network. By employing a tailored architecture and acceleration techniques for the auxiliary network, NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation, leading to improved performance compared with previous methods. Extensive experiments on large-scale CLIP training, spanning datasets from millions to billions of samples, demonstrate that NeuCLIP outperforms previous methods."}

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations."}

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality."}

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics."}

However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption.

This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution."}

The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) systems amplifies these challenges, as resource-constrained IoT devices demand scalable and efficient security solutions. In this work, an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) utilizing Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is proposed for autonomous and optimized cyber-attack detection in modern networking environments. The proposed IDS framework integrates two primary innovative techniques: Optimized Importance and Percentage-based Automated Feature Selection (OIP-AutoFS) and Optimized Performance, Confidence, and Efficiency-based Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (OPCE-CASH). These components optimize feature selection and model learning processes to strike a balance between intrusion detection effectiveness and computational efficiency. This work presents the first IDS framework that integrates all four AutoML stages and employs multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize detection effectiveness, efficiency, and confidence for deployment in resource-constrained systems. Experimental evaluations over two benchmark cybersecurity datasets demonstrate that the proposed MOO-AutoML IDS outperforms state-of-the-art IDSs, establishing a new benchmark for autonomous, efficient, and optimized security for networks. Designed to support IoT and edge environments with resource constraints, the proposed framework is applicable to a variety of autonomous cybersecurity applications across diverse networked environments."}
