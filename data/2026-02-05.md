Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier. The source code of GeoIB is released at "https://anonymous.4open.science/r/G-IB-0569".

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a novel information-theoretic perspective on generalization in machine learning by framing the learning problem within the context of lossy compression and applying finite blocklength analysis. In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework.

Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.

Abstract: The pursuit of optimal trade-offs in high-dimensional search spaces under stringent computational constraints poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary multi-objective optimization. We develop NeuroPareto, a cohesive architecture that integrates rank-centric filtering, uncertainty disentanglement, and history-conditioned acquisition strategies to navigate complex objective landscapes. A calibrated Bayesian classifier estimates epistemic uncertainty across non-domination tiers, enabling rapid generation of high-quality candidates with minimal evaluation cost. Deep Gaussian Process surrogates further separate predictive uncertainty into reducible and irreducible components, providing refined predictive means and risk-aware signals for downstream selection. A lightweight acquisition network, trained online from historical hypervolume improvements, guides expensive evaluations toward regions balancing convergence and diversity. With hierarchical screening and amortized surrogate updates, the method maintains accuracy while keeping computational overhead low. Experiments on DTLZ and ZDT suites and a subsurface energy extraction task show that NeuroPareto consistently outperforms classifier-enhanced and surrogate-assisted baselines in Pareto proximity and hypervolume.

Abstract: This work presents a consensus-based Bayesian framework to detect malicious user behavior in enterprise directory access graphs. By modeling directories as topics and users as agents within a multi-level interaction graph, we simulate access evolution using influence-weighted opinion dynamics. Logical dependencies between users are encoded in dynamic matrices Ci, and directory similarity is captured via a shared influence matrix W. Malicious behavior is injected as cross-component logical perturbations that violate structural norms of strongly connected components(SCCs). We apply theoretical guarantees from opinion dynamics literature to determine topic convergence and detect anomaly via scaled opinion variance. To quantify uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian anomaly scoring mechanism that evolves over time, using both static and online priors. Simulations over synthetic access graphs validate our method, demonstrating its sensitivity to logical inconsistencies and robustness under dynamic perturbation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The target network update frequency (TUF) is a central stabilization mechanism in (deep) Q-learning. However, their selection remains poorly understood and is often treated merely as another tunable hyperparameter rather than as a principled design decision. This work provides a theoretical analysis of target fixing in tabular Q-learning through the lens of approximate dynamic programming. We formulate periodic target updates as a nested optimization scheme in which each outer iteration applies an inexact Bellman optimality operator, approximated by a generic inner loop optimizer. Rigorous theory yields a finite-time convergence analysis for the asynchronous sampling setting, specializing to stochastic gradient descent in the inner loop. Our results deliver an explicit characterization of the bias-variance trade-off induced by the target update period, showing how to optimally set this critical hyperparameter. We prove that constant target update schedules are suboptimal, incurring a logarithmic overhead in sample complexity that is entirely avoidable with adaptive schedules. Our analysis shows that the optimal target update frequency increases geometrically over the course of the learning process.

Abstract: This paper investigates the forecasting performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for univariate time series forecasting using a subset of the M4 Forecasting Competition dataset. Focusing on monthly and quarterly time series with at most 20 years of historical data, we evaluate whether a fully automatic, purely feedback-driven ESN can serve as a competitive alternative to widely used statistical forecasting methods. The study adopts a rigorous two-stage evaluation approach: a Parameter dataset is used to conduct an extensive hyperparameter sweep covering leakage rate, spectral radius, reservoir size, and information criteria for regularization, resulting in over four million ESN model fits; a disjoint Forecast dataset is then used for out-of-sample accuracy assessment. Forecast accuracy is measured using MASE and sMAPE and benchmarked against simple benchmarks like drift and seasonal naive and statistical models like ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS. The hyperparameter analysis reveals consistent and interpretable patterns, with monthly series favoring moderately persistent reservoirs and quarterly series favoring more contractive dynamics. Across both frequencies, high leakage rates are preferred, while optimal spectral radii and reservoir sizes vary with temporal resolution. In the out-of-sample evaluation, the ESN performs on par with ARIMA and TBATS for monthly data and achieves the lowest mean MASE for quarterly data, while requiring lower computational cost than the more complex statistical models. Overall, the results demonstrate that ESNs offer a compelling balance between predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, positioning them as a practical option for automated time series forecasting.

Abstract: Effective demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste. However, data privacy concerns often hinder collaboration among retailers, limiting the potential for improved predictive accuracy. In this study, we explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), with a focus on the grocery retail sector dealing with perishable goods. We develop a baseline predictive model for demand forecasting and waste assessment in an isolated retailer scenario. Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

Abstract: This paper tackles a critical bottleneck in Super-Structure-based divide-and-conquer causal discovery: the high computational cost of constructing accurate Super-Structures--particularly when conditional independence (CI) tests are expensive and domain knowledge is unavailable. We propose a novel, lightweight framework that relaxes the strict requirements on Super-Structure construction while preserving the algorithmic benefits of divide-and-conquer. By integrating weakly constrained Super-Structures with efficient graph partitioning and merging strategies, our approach substantially lowers CI test overhead without sacrificing accuracy. We instantiate the framework in a concrete causal discovery algorithm and rigorously evaluate its components on synthetic data. Comprehensive experiments on Gaussian Bayesian networks, including magic-NIAB, ECOLI70, and magic-IRRI, demonstrate that our method matches or closely approximates the structural accuracy of PC and FCI while drastically reducing the number of CI tests. Further validation on the real-world China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset confirms its practical applicability. Our results establish that accurate, scalable causal discovery is achievable even under minimal assumptions about the initial Super-Structure, opening new avenues for applying divide-and-conquer methods to large-scale, knowledge-scarce domains such as biomedical and social science research.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable sparse expert activation, meaning that only a subset of the model's parameters is used during each inference. However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.

Abstract: Affordable housing shortages affect billions, while land scarcity and regulations make site selection slow. We present AURA (Autonomous Urban Resource Allocator), a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning system for real-time affordable housing site selection under hard regulatory constraints (QCT, DDA, LIHTC). We model the task as a constrained multi-objective Markov decision process optimizing accessibility, environmental impact, construction cost, and social equity while enforcing feasibility. AURA uses a regulatory-aware state encoding 127 federal and local constraints, Pareto-constrained policy gradients with feasibility guarantees, and reward decomposition separating immediate costs from long-term social outcomes. On datasets from 8 U.S. metros (47,392 candidate parcels), AURA attains 94.3% regulatory compliance and improves Pareto hypervolume by 37.2% over strong baselines. In a New York City 2026 case study, it reduces selection time from 18 months to 72 hours and identifies 23% more viable sites; chosen sites have 31% better transit access and 19% lower environmental impact than expert picks.

Abstract: Tabular learning is still dominated by row-wise predictors that score each row independently, which fits i.i.d. benchmarks but fails on transactional, temporal, and relational tables where labels depend on other rows. We show that row-wise prediction rules out natural targets driven by global counts, overlaps, and relational patterns. To make "using structure" precise across architectures, we introduce grables: a modular interface that separates how a table is lifted to a graph (constructor) from how predictions are computed on that graph (node predictor), pinpointing where expressive power comes from. Experiments on synthetic tasks, transaction data, and a RelBench clinical-trials dataset confirm the predicted separations: message passing captures inter-row dependencies that row-local models miss, and hybrid approaches that explicitly extract inter-row structure and feed it to strong tabular learners yield consistent gains.

Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.

Abstract: We study the effect of group symmetrization of pre-trained models on conformal prediction (CP), a post-hoc, distribution-free, finite-sample method of uncertainty quantification that offers formal coverage guarantees under the assumption of data exchangeability. Unfortunately, CP uncertainty regions can grow significantly in long horizon missions, rendering the statistical guarantees uninformative. To that end, we propose infusing CP with geometric information via group-averaging of the pretrained predictor to distribute the non-conformity mass across the orbits. Each sample now is treated as a representative of an orbit, thus uncertainty can be mitigated by other samples entangled to it via the orbit inducing elements of the symmetry group. Our approach provably yields contracted non-conformity scores in increasing convex order, implying improved exponential-tail bounds and sharper conformal prediction sets in expectation, especially at high confidence levels. We then propose an experimental design to test these theoretical claims in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

Abstract: The predictive machine learning models for child mortality tend to be inaccurate when applied to future populations, since they suffer from look-ahead bias due to the randomization used in cross-validation. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from Bangladesh for 2011-2022, with n = 33,962, are used in this paper. We trained the model on (2011-2014) data, validated it on 2017 data, and tested it on 2022 data. Eight years after the initial test of the model, a genetic algorithm-based Neural Architecture Search found a single-layer neural architecture (with 64 units) to be superior to XGBoost (AUROC = 0.76 vs. 0.73; p < 0.01). Additionally, through a detailed fairness audit, we identified an overall "Socioeconomic Predictive Gradient," with a positive correlation between regional poverty level (r = -0.62) and the algorithm's AUC. In addition, we found that the model performed at its highest levels in the least affluent divisions (AUC 0.74) and decreased dramatically in the wealthiest divisions (AUC 0.66). These findings suggest that the model is identifying areas with the greatest need for intervention. Our model would identify approximately 1300 additional at-risk children annually than a Gradient Boosting model when screened at the 10% level and validated using SHAP values and Platt Calibration, and therefore provide a robust, production-ready computational phenotype for targeted maternal and child health interventions.

Abstract: Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful and popular dimensionality reduction technique. However, due to its linear nature, it often fails to capture the complex underlying structure of real-world data. While Kernel PCA (kPCA) addresses non-linearity, it sacrifices interpretability and struggles with hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition. We introduce a novel, granular objective function that maximizes the individual variance contribution of each variable providing a stronger learning signal than global variance maximization. This approach natively handles categorical and ordinal variables without the dimensional explosion associated with one-hot encoding. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both linear PCA and kPCA in explained variance across synthetic and real-world datasets. At the same time, it preserves PCA's interpretability, enabling visualization and analysis of feature contributions using standard tools such as biplots. The code can be found on GitHub.

Abstract: Credit exposure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is often implicit and token-mediated, creating a dense web of inter-protocol dependencies. Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is widely assumed to expose a model's reasoning process and improve transparency. We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically treat nonlinearities as fixed primitives (e.g., ReLU), limiting both interpretability and the granularity of control over the induced function class. While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Padé-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput. Code is available at https://github.com/jushengzhang/Rational-ANOVA-Networks.git.

Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, the cost of full-parameter fine-tuning has made parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the default strategy for downstream adaptation. Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.

Abstract: We present GROOVE, a semi-supervised multi-modal representation learning approach for high-content perturbation data where samples across modalities are weakly paired through shared perturbation labels but lack direct correspondence. Our primary contribution is GroupCLIP, a novel group-level contrastive loss that bridges the gap between CLIP for paired cross-modal data and SupCon for uni-modal supervised contrastive learning, addressing a fundamental gap in contrastive learning for weakly-paired settings. We integrate GroupCLIP with an on-the-fly backtranslating autoencoder framework to encourage cross-modally entangled representations while maintaining group-level coherence within a shared latent space. Critically, we introduce a comprehensive combinatorial evaluation framework that systematically assesses representation learners across multiple optimal transport aligners, addressing key limitations in existing evaluation strategies. This framework includes novel simulations that systematically vary shared versus modality-specific perturbation effects enabling principled assessment of method robustness. Our combinatorial benchmarking reveals that there is not yet an aligner that uniformly dominates across settings or modality pairs. Across simulations and two real single-cell genetic perturbation datasets, GROOVE performs on par with or outperforms existing approaches for downstream cross-modal matching and imputation tasks. Our ablation studies demonstrate that GroupCLIP is the key component driving performance gains. These results highlight the importance of leveraging group-level constraints for effective multi-modal representation learning in scenarios where only weak pairing is available.

Abstract: Tabular Language Models (TLMs) have been claimed to achieve emergent generalization for tabular prediction. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of Tabula-8B as a representative TLM, utilizing 165 datasets from the UniPredict benchmark. Our investigation reveals three findings. First, binary and categorical classification achieve near-zero median lift over majority-class baselines and strong aggregate performance is driven entirely by quartile classification tasks. Second, top-performing datasets exhibit pervasive contamination, including complete train-test overlap and task-level leakage that evades standard deduplication. Third, instruction-tuning without tabular exposure recovers 92.2% of standard classification performance and on quartile classification, format familiarity closes 71.3% of the gap with the residual attributable to contaminated datasets. These findings suggest claimed generalization likely reflects evaluation artifacts rather than learned tabular reasoning. We conclude with recommendations for strengthening TLM evaluation.

Abstract: Learning domain adaptive policies that can generalize to unseen transition dynamics, remains a fundamental challenge in learning-based control. Substantial progress has been made through domain representation learning to capture domain-specific information, thus enabling domain-aware decision making. We analyze the process of learning domain representations through dynamical prediction and find that selecting contexts adjacent to the current step causes the learned representations to entangle static domain information with varying dynamical properties. Such mixture can confuse the conditioned policy, thereby constraining zero-shot adaptation. To tackle the challenge, we propose DADP (Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy), which achieves robust adaptation through unsupervised disentanglement and domain-aware diffusion injection. First, we introduce Lagged Context Dynamical Prediction, a strategy that conditions future state estimation on a historical offset context; by increasing this temporal gap, we unsupervisedly disentangle static domain representations by filtering out transient properties. Second, we integrate the learned domain representations directly into the generative process by biasing the prior distribution and reformulating the diffusion target. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks across locomotion and manipulation demonstrate the superior performance, and the generalizability of DADP over prior methods. More visualization results are available on the https://outsider86.github.io/DomainAdaptiveDiffusionPolicy/.

Abstract: Cuffless blood pressure screening based on easily acquired photoplethysmography (PPG) signals offers a practical pathway toward scalable cardiovascular health assessment. Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards. Our results show that existing PPG-based BP estimation models lack clinical practicality under standardized conditions, while incorporating demographic information markedly improves their accuracy and physiological validity.

Abstract: We propose Partition Trees, a tree-based framework for conditional density estimation over general outcome spaces, supporting both continuous and categorical variables within a unified formulation. Our approach models conditional distributions as piecewise-constant densities on data adaptive partitions and learns trees by directly minimizing conditional negative log-likelihood. This yields a scalable, nonparametric alternative to existing probabilistic trees that does not make parametric assumptions about the target distribution. We further introduce Partition Forests, an ensemble extension obtained by averaging conditional densities. Empirically, we demonstrate improved probabilistic prediction over CART-style trees and competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic tree methods and Random Forests, along with robustness to redundant features and heteroscedastic noise.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.

Abstract: Understanding how neural representations respond to geometric transformations is essential for evaluating whether learned features preserve meaningful spatial structure. Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.

Abstract: The calculation of shortest-path distances in road networks is a core operation in navigation systems, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Although classical algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, provide exact answers, their latency is prohibitive for modern real-time, large-scale deployments. Over the past two decades, numerous distance indexes have been proposed to speed up query processing for shortest distance queries. More recently, with the advancement in machine learning (ML), researchers have designed and proposed ML-based distance indexes to answer approximate shortest path and distance queries efficiently. However, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these ML-based approaches is lacking. This paper presents the first empirical survey of ML-based distance indexes on road networks, evaluating them along four key dimensions: Training time, query latency, storage, and accuracy. Using seven real-world road networks and workload-driven query datasets derived from trajectory data, we benchmark ten representative ML techniques and compare them against strong classical non-ML baselines, highlighting key insights and practical trade-offs. We release a unified open-source codebase to support reproducibility and future research on learned distance indexes.

Abstract: Survey papers play a central role in synthesizing and organizing scientific knowledge, yet they are increasingly strained by the rapid growth of research output. As new work continues to appear after publication, surveys quickly become outdated, contributing to redundancy and fragmentation in the literature. We reframe survey writing as a long-horizon maintenance problem rather than a one-time generation task, treating surveys as living documents that evolve alongside the research they describe. We propose an agentic Dynamic Survey Framework that supports the continuous updating of existing survey papers by incrementally integrating new work while preserving survey structure and minimizing unnecessary disruption. Using a retrospective experimental setup, we demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively identifies and incorporates emerging research while preserving the coherence and structure of existing surveys.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet methods to verify which model components are truly necessary for language function remain limited. Current interpretability approaches rely on internal metrics and lack external validation. Here we present the Brain-LLM Unified Model (BLUM), a framework that leverages lesion-symptom mapping, the gold standard for establishing causal brain-behavior relationships for over a century, as an external reference structure for evaluating LLM perturbation effects. Using data from individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (N = 410), we trained symptom-to-lesion models that predict brain damage location from behavioral error profiles, applied systematic perturbations to transformer layers, administered identical clinical assessments to perturbed LLMs and human patients, and projected LLM error profiles into human lesion space. LLM error profiles were sufficiently similar to human error profiles that predicted lesions corresponded to actual lesions in error-matched humans above chance in 67% of picture naming conditions (p < 10^{-23}) and 68.3% of sentence completion conditions (p < 10^{-61}), with semantic-dominant errors mapping onto ventral-stream lesion patterns and phonemic-dominant errors onto dorsal-stream patterns. These findings open a new methodological avenue for LLM interpretability in which clinical neuroscience provides external validation, establishing human lesion-symptom mapping as a reference framework for evaluating artificial language systems and motivating direct investigation of whether behavioral alignment reflects shared computational principles.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).

Abstract: Deterministic neural operators perform well on many PDEs but can struggle with the approximation of high-frequency wave phenomena, where strong input-to-output sensitivity makes operator learning challenging, and spectral bias blurs oscillations. We argue for adopting a probabilistic approach for approximating waves in high-frequency regime, and develop our probabilistic framework using a score-based conditional diffusion operator. After demonstrating a stability analysis of the Helmholtz operator, we present our numerical experiments across a wide range of frequencies, benchmarked against other popular data-driven and machine learning approaches for waves. We show that our probabilistic neural operator consistently produces robust predictions with the lowest errors in $L^2$, $H^1$, and energy norms. Moreover, unlike all the other tested deterministic approaches, our framework remarkably captures uncertainties in the input sound speed map propagated to the solution field. We envision that our results position probabilistic operator learning as a principled and effective approach for solving complex PDEs such as Helmholtz in the challenging high-frequency regime.

Abstract: Concept-based models (CMs) enhance interpretability in deep learning by grounding predictions in human-understandable concepts. However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines. Notably, F-CMs enable interpretable inference on concepts not available to a given institution, a key novelty with respect to existing approaches.

Abstract: Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) is hindered by context rigidity: tokens are retained based on transient high confidence, often ignoring that early predictions lack full context. This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points.

Abstract: Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows.

Abstract: Semi-dual neural optimal transport learns a transport map via a max-min objective, yet training can converge to incorrect or degenerate maps. We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$. This provides a principled stopping rule: annealing below $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ can $\textit{worsen}$ optimization conditioning without improving statistical accuracy.

Abstract: The equations of complex dynamical systems may not be identified by expert knowledge, especially if the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\% for learning a time series and below 6\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets. Our findings demonstrate that integrating time-varying parameters into data-driven discovery of differential equations improves both modeling accuracy and forecasting performance.

Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.

Abstract: Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.

Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains for its ability to optimize risk-sensitive objectives. However, the role of the discount factor is often overlooked, as it is typically treated as a fixed parameter of the Markov decision process or tunable hyperparameter, with little consideration of its effect on the learned policy. In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning discretization-invariant function-to-function mappings in scientific computing. However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-Loève expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.

Abstract: Multimodal Process Reward Models (MPRMs) are central to step-level supervision for visual reasoning in MLLMs. Training MPRMs typically requires large-scale Monte Carlo (MC)-annotated corpora, incurring substantial training cost. This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains is critical for real-world applications, yet existing spatiotemporal models often suffer from performance degradation under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts. We address these challenges through the lens of structure-aware context selection. We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models.

Abstract: Static sparse training is a promising route to efficient learning by committing to a fixed mask pattern, yet the constrained structure reduces robustness. Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.

Abstract: Plug-and-play diffusion priors (PnPDP) have become a powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems in scientific and engineering domains. Yet, current evaluations of reconstruction quality emphasize point-estimate accuracy metrics on a single sample, which do not reflect the stochastic nature of PnPDP solvers and the intrinsic uncertainty of inverse problems, critical for scientific tasks. This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs.

Abstract: Learning the intrinsic dimensionality of subjective perceptual spaces such as taste, smell, or aesthetics from ordinal data is a challenging problem. We introduce LORE (Low Rank Ordinal Embedding), a scalable framework that jointly learns both the intrinsic dimensionality and an ordinal embedding from noisy triplet comparisons of the form, "Is A more similar to B than C?". Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from sparse point-sensor measurements is a central challenge in learning parametric PDE dynamics. Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions. We propose STRIDE (Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Implicit DEcoder), a two-stage framework that maps a short window of sensor measurements to a latent state with a temporal encoder and reconstructs the field at arbitrary query locations with a modulated implicit neural representation (INR) decoder. Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise.

Abstract: Certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, as formal guarantees often require solving non-convex problems. Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%.

Abstract: This paper aims to train a graph foundation model that is able to represent any graph as a vector preserving structural and semantic information useful for downstream graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph clustering. To learn the features of graphs from diverse domains while maintaining strong generalization ability to new domains, we propose a multi-graph-based feature alignment method, which constructs weighted graphs using the attributes of all nodes in each dataset and then generates consistent node embeddings. To enhance the consistency of the features from different datasets, we propose a density maximization mean alignment algorithm with guaranteed convergence. The original graphs and generated node embeddings are fed into a graph neural network to achieve discriminative graph representations in contrastive learning. More importantly, to enhance the information preservation from node-level representations to the graph-level representation, we construct a multi-layer reference distribution module without using any pooling operation. We also provide a theoretical generalization bound to support the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results of few-shot graph classification and graph clustering show that our model outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: In partial multi-label learning (PML), the true labels are unobserved, which makes label disambiguation important but difficult. A key challenge is that ambiguous candidate labels can propagate errors into downstream tasks such as feature engineering. To solve this issue, we jointly model the disambiguation and feature selection tasks as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to turn PML risk minimization into expected-return maximization. Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size. Experiments in multiple metrics and data sets verify the advantages of the framework.

Abstract: Residual connections are the de facto standard for mitigating vanishing gradients, yet they impose structural constraints and fail to address the inherent inefficiencies of piecewise linear activations. We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it frequently encounters challenges such as entropy collapse, excessive verbosity, and insufficient exploration for hard problems. Crucially, existing reward schemes fail to distinguish between the need for extensive search during problem-solving and the efficiency required for mastered knowledge. In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes "thickening" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to "thinning", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Many fields collect large-scale temporal data through repeated measurements (trials), where each trial is labeled with a set of metadata variables spanning several categories. For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings.

Abstract: Non Pneumatic tires offer a promising alternative to pneumatic tires. However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs. Overall, the proposed framework enables systematic development of high performance, next generation UPTIS spoke structures.

Abstract: We propose the Convolutional Operator Network for Forward and Inverse Problems (FI-Conv), a framework capable of predicting system evolution and estimating parameters in complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence. FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics.

Abstract: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures remains challenging: while spherical-harmonic equivariant models are expressive, their Clebsch-Gordan tensor products incur substantial compute and memory costs for higher-order targets.

By performing learning in channel space and using Cartesian tensor bases to assemble equivariant outputs, CEITNet enables efficient construction of high-order tensor. Across benchmark datasets for order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensor prediction, CEITNet surpasses prior high-order prediction methods on key accuracy criteria while offering high computational efficiency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling strategies have effectively leveraged inference-time compute to enhance the reasoning abilities of Autoregressive Large Language Models. In this work, we demonstrate that Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) are inherently amenable to advanced search strategies, owing to their iterative and non-autoregressive generation process. To leverage this, we propose UnMaskFork (UMF), a framework that formulates the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the generation path. In contrast to standard scaling methods relying on stochastic sampling, UMF explores the search space through deterministic partial unmasking actions performed by multiple MDLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that UMF consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines on complex coding benchmarks, while also exhibiting strong scalability on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Linear attention significantly reduces the computational complexity of Transformers from quadratic to linear, yet it consistently lags behind softmax-based attention in performance. We identify the root cause of this degradation as the non-negativity constraint imposed on kernel feature maps: standard projections like ReLU act as "passive truncation" operators, indiscriminately discarding semantic information residing in the negative domain. We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing.

Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative machine learning (ML) without a central server, making it suitable for settings where training data cannot be centrally hosted. We introduce Mosaic Learning, a DL framework that decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently across the network. Fragmentation reduces redundant communication across correlated parameters and enables more diverse information propagation without increasing communication cost. We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline. In summary, Mosaic Learning improves DL performance without sacrificing its utility or efficiency, and positions itself as a new DL standard.

Abstract: Hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) effectively model higher-order interactions in many real-world systems but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their deployment in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce CF-HyperGNNExplainer, a counterfactual explanation method for HGNNs that identifies the minimal structural changes required to alter a model's prediction. The method generates counterfactual hypergraphs using actionable edits limited to removing node-hyperedge incidences or deleting hyperedges, producing concise and structurally meaningful explanations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that CF-HyperGNNExplainer generates valid and concise counterfactuals, highlighting the higher-order relations most critical to HGNN decisions.

Abstract: Recent works focus on synthesizing Chart Understanding (ChartU) training sets to inject advanced chart knowledge into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where the sufficiency of the knowledge is typically verified by quantifying capability gains via the fine-tune-then-evaluate paradigm. However, full-set fine-tuning MLLMs to assess such gains incurs significant time costs, hindering the iterative refinement cycles of the ChartU dataset. Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures.

Abstract: Recently, there has been great success in leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series analysis. The core idea lies in effectively aligning the modality between natural language and time series. However, the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLMs capabilities. To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, "Common Ground", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification.

Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used to support decision-making. To verify their reliability and adaptability, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of tools and methods for tasks such as NN code verification, refactoring, and migration. These tools play a crucial role in guaranteeing both the correctness and maintainability of neural network architectures, helping to prevent implementation errors, simplify model updates, and ensure that complex networks can be reliably extended and reused. Yet, assessing their effectiveness remains challenging due to the lack of publicly diverse datasets of neural networks that would allow systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a dataset of neural networks that can serve as a benchmark for validation. The dataset is designed to cover diverse architectural components and to handle multiple input data types and tasks. In total, 608 samples are generated, each conforming to a set of precise design choices. To further ensure their consistency, we validate the correctness of the generated networks using static analysis and symbolic tracing. We make the dataset publicly available to support the community in advancing research on neural network reliability and adaptability.

Abstract: Distributed training of foundation models via $\texttt{DDP}$ is limited by interconnect bandwidth. While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\approx 10 \times$. Finally, we show that $\texttt{LoRDO}$ improves performance even more in very low-memory settings with small rank/batch size.

Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA. Overall, we show that EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and powerful approach to scaling RL for LLMs. Code: https://github.com/LunjunZhang/ema-pg

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but they also introduce significant safety risks when individual agents fail or behave adversarially. In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Modern chess language models are dense transformers trained on millions of games played by thousands of high-rated individuals. However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.

Abstract: Attention head pruning has emerged as an effective technique for transformer model compression, an increasingly important goal in the era of Green AI. However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment.

Abstract: The Web is naturally heterogeneous with user devices, geographic regions, browsing patterns, and contexts all leading to highly diverse, unique datasets. Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets. This work advances the vision of scalable, privacy-preserving intelligence for real-world heterogeneous and distributed web systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge for neural networks when tasks are trained sequentially. In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.

Abstract: We develop a general mathematical framework to analyze scaling regimes and derive explicit analytic solutions for gradient flow (GF) in large learning problems. Our key innovation is a formal power series expansion of the loss evolution, with coefficients encoded by diagrams akin to Feynman diagrams. We show that this expansion has a well-defined large-size limit that can be used to reveal different learning phases and, in some cases, to obtain explicit solutions of the nonlinear GF. We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics. We observe a very good agreement of our theoretical predictions with experiment.

Abstract: Learning from a stream of tasks usually pits plasticity against stability: acquiring new knowledge often causes catastrophic forgetting of past information. Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems.

Abstract: Safe artificial intelligence for perception tasks remains a major challenge, partly due to the lack of data with high-quality labels. Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark.

Abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) provide a principled model for handling constraints, such as safety and other auxiliary objectives, in reinforcement learning. The common approach of using additive-cost constraints and dual variables often hinders off-policy scalability. We propose a Control as Inference formulation based on stochastic decision horizons, where constraint violations attenuate reward contributions and shorten the effective planning horizon via state-action-dependent continuation. This yields survival-weighted objectives that remain replay-compatible for off-policy actor-critic learning. We propose two violation semantics, absorbing and virtual termination, that share the same survival-weighted return but result in distinct optimization structures that lead to SAC/MPO-style policy improvement. Experiments demonstrate improved sample efficiency and favorable return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. Moreover, MPO with virtual termination (VT-MPO) scales effectively to our high-dimensional musculoskeletal Hyfydy setup.

Abstract: Hybrid models and Neural Differential Equations (NDE) are getting increasingly important for the modeling of physical systems, however they often encounter stability and accuracy issues during long-term integration. Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems.

Abstract: GRPO-style reinforcement learning (RL)-based LLM fine-tuning algorithms have recently gained popularity. Relying on heuristic trust-region approximations, however, they can lead to brittle optimization behavior, as global importance-ratio clipping and group-wise normalization fail to regulate samples whose importance ratios fall outside the clipping range. We propose Query-Adaptive Trust-Region policy Optimization (QUATRO), which directly enforces trust-region constraints through a principled optimization. This yields a clear and interpretable objective that enables explicit control over policy updates and stable, entropy-controlled optimization, with a stabilizer terms arising intrinsically from the exact trust-region formulation. Empirically verified on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, QUATRO shows stable training under increased policy staleness and aggressive learning rates, maintaining well-controlled entropy throughout training.

Abstract: Multivariate time series underpin modern critical infrastructure, making the prediction of anomalies a vital necessity for proactive risk mitigation. While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.

Abstract: Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbolΣ^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/BeyondMuon.

Abstract: Transportation on graphs is a fundamental challenge across many domains, where decisions must respect topological and operational constraints. Despite the need for actionable policies, existing graph-transport methods lack this expressivity. They rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to generalize across sparse topologies, and scale poorly with graph size and time horizon. To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schrödinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.

Abstract: Time series forecasting in real-world applications requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.

Abstract: Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.

Abstract: While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.

Abstract: Multi-horizon time-series forecasting involves simultaneously making predictions for a consecutive sequence of subsequent time steps. This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.

Abstract: The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.

Abstract: Despite the central role of attention heads in Transformers, we lack tools to understand why a model attends to a particular token. To address this, we study the query-key (QK) space -- the bilinear joint embedding space between queries and keys. We present a contrastive covariance method to decompose the QK space into low-rank, human-interpretable components. It is when features in keys and queries align in these low-rank subspaces that high attention scores are produced. We first study our method both analytically and empirically in a simplified setting. We then apply our method to large language models to identify human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic features and binding features. Finally, we demonstrate how attention scores can be attributed to our identified features.

Abstract: Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment.

Abstract: Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our results in more challenging tasks such as dynamic/universal regret minimization and bandit games, establishing the first gradient-variation dynamic and universal regret bounds for two-point BCO and fast convergence rates in bandit games.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.

Abstract: Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.

Abstract: Accurate and timely seizure detection from Electroencephalography (EEG) is critical for clinical intervention, yet manual review of long-term recordings is labor-intensive. Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect.

Abstract: Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space.

Abstract: In high-stakes risk prediction, quantifying uncertainty through interval-valued predictions is essential for reliable decision-making. However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.

Abstract: Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.

Abstract: With more wind farms clustered for integration, the short-term wind speed prediction of such wind farm clusters is critical for normal operation of power systems. This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.

Abstract: We make the information transmitted by attention an explicit, measurable quantity in vision transformers. By inserting variational information bottlenecks on all attention-mediated writes to the residual stream -- without other architectural changes -- we train models with an explicit information cost and obtain a controllable spectrum from independent patch processing to fully expressive global attention. On ImageNet-100, we characterize how classification behavior and information routing evolve across this spectrum, and provide initial insights into how global visual representations emerge from local patch processing by analyzing the first attention heads that transmit information. By biasing learning toward solutions with constrained internal communication, our approach yields models that are more tractable for mechanistic analysis and more amenable to control.

Abstract: While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.

Abstract: We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.

We also propose an approach based on multilingual node features with an improved asymmetric decoder for compatibility, which allows us to generalize and extend the prediction to more, geographically and linguistically disjoint, data from New Zealand. Our adaptations also improve inductive transferability between these disjoint legal systems.

Abstract: Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.

Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.

Abstract: Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.

Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) requires agents to learn from a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired policies. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed many applications but remain expensive to train. Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) addresses this through conditional computation, with Expert Parallel (EP) as the standard distributed training method. However, EP has three limitations: communication cost grows linearly with the number of activated experts $k$, load imbalance affects latency and memory usage, and data-dependent communication requires metadata exchange. We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation. Compared to MoE with EP, Multi-Head LatentMoE with HP trains up to $1.61\times$ faster while having identical performance. With doubled granularity, it achieves higher overall performance while still being $1.11\times$ faster. Our method makes multi-billion-parameter foundation model research more accessible.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.

Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.

Abstract: Inverse problems are often ill-posed and require optimization schemes with strong stability and convergence guarantees. While learning-based approaches such as deep unrolling and meta-learning achieve strong empirical performance, they typically lack explicit control over descent and curvature, limiting robustness. We propose a learned Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework for inverse problems within a bilevel optimization setting. Instead of learning a full optimizer, we learn a structured curvature majorant that governs each MM step while preserving classical MM descent guarantees. The majorant is parameterized by a lightweight recurrent neural network and explicitly constrained to satisfy valid MM conditions. For cosine-similarity losses, we derive explicit curvature bounds yielding diagonal majorants. When analytic bounds are unavailable, we rely on efficient Hessian-vector product-based spectral estimation to automatically upper-bound local curvature without forming the Hessian explicitly. Experiments on EEG source imaging demonstrate improved accuracy, stability, and cross-dataset generalization over deep-unrolled and meta-learning baselines.

Abstract: We present the Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset, a comprehensive dataset to serve both as a benchmark for radar pulse deinterleaving research and as an enabler of new research methods. The dataset addresses the critical problem of separating interleaved radar pulses from multiple unknown emitters for electronic warfare applications and signal intelligence. Our dataset contains a total of 6000 pulse trains over two receiver configurations, totalling to almost 3 billion pulses, featuring realistic scenarios with up to 110 emitters and significant parameter space overlap. To encourage dataset adoption and establish standardised evaluation procedures, we have launched an accompanying Turing Deinterleaving Challenge, for which models need to associate pulses in interleaved pulse trains to the correct emitter by clustering and maximising metrics such as the V-measure. The Turing Synthetic Radar Dataset is one of the first publicly available, comprehensively simulated pulse train datasets aimed to facilitate sophisticated model development in the electronic warfare community

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) plays a crucial role in continuous cardiovascular health monitoring as a non-invasive and cost-effective modality. However, PPG signals are susceptible to motion artifacts and noise, making accurate estimation of vital signs such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) challenging. Existing estimation methods are often restricted to a single-task or environment, limiting their generalizability across diverse PPG decoding scenarios. Moreover, recent general-purpose approaches typically rely on predictions over multi-second intervals, discarding the morphological characteristics of vital signs. To address these challenges, we propose PENGUIN, a generative flow-matching framework that extends deep state space models, enabling fine-grained conditioning on PPG for reconstructing multiple vital signs as continuous waveforms. We evaluate PENGUIN using six real-world PPG datasets across three distinct vital sign reconstruction tasks (electrocardiogram reconstruction, respiratory monitoring, and ABP monitoring). Our method consistently outperformed both task-specific and general-purpose baselines, demonstrating PENGUIN as a general framework for robust vital sign reconstruction from PPG.

Abstract: Near-field U-MIMO communications require carefully optimized sampling grids in both angular and distance domains. However, most existing grid design methods neglect the influence of base station height, assuming instead that the base station is positioned at ground level - a simplification that rarely reflects real-world deployments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generalized grid design framework that accommodates arbitrary base station locations. Unlike conventional correlation-based approaches, our method optimizes the grid based on the minimization of the optimal normalized mean squared error, leading to more accurate channel representation. We evaluate the performance of a hybrid U-MIMO system operating at sub-THz frequencies, considering the P-SOMP algorithm for channel estimation. Analytical and numerical results show that the proposed design enhances both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency compared to existing alternatives.

Abstract: We propose a cross-attention Transformer for joint decoding of uplink OFDM signals received by multiple coordinated access points. A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication and sensing. Yet, today's learning-based wireless techniques do not generalize well: most models are task-specific, environment-dependent, and limited to narrow sensing modalities, requiring costly retraining when deployed in new scenarios. This work introduces a task-agnostic, multi-modal foundational model for physical-layer wireless systems that learns transferable, physics-aware representations across heterogeneous modalities, enabling robust generalization across tasks and environments. Our framework employs a physics-guided self-supervised pretraining strategy incorporating a dedicated physical token to capture cross-modal physical correspondences governed by electromagnetic propagation. The learned representations enable efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks, including massive multi-antenna optimization, wireless channel estimation, and device localization, using limited labeled data. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate superior generalization, robustness to deployment shifts, and reduced data requirements compared to task-specific baselines.

Abstract: Neural control of grasping arises from nonlinear interactions across multiple brain rhythms, yet EEG-based motor decoding has largely relied on linear, second-order spectral features. Here, we examine whether higher-order cross-frequency dynamics distinguish motor planning from execution during natural reach-to-grasp behavior. EEG was recorded in a cue-based paradigm during executed precision and power grips, enabling stage-resolved analysis of preparatory and execution-related neural activity.
  Cross-frequency bispectral analysis was used to compute bicoherence matrices across canonical frequency band pairs, from which magnitude- and phase-based features were extracted. Classification, permutation-based feature selection, and within-subject statistical testing showed that execution is characterized by substantially stronger and more discriminative nonlinear coupling than planning, with dominant contributions from beta- and gamma-driven interactions. In contrast, decoding of precision versus power grips achieved comparable performance during planning and execution, indicating that grasp-type representations emerge during planning and persist into execution.
  Spatial and spectral analyses further revealed that informative bispectral features reflect coordinated activity across prefrontal, central, and occipital regions. Despite substantial feature redundancy, effective dimensionality reduction preserved decoding performance. Together, these findings demonstrate that nonlinear cross-frequency coupling provides an interpretable and robust marker of motor planning and execution, extending bispectral EEG analysis to ecologically valid grasping and supporting its relevance for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetic control.

Abstract: Channel estimation in wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems faces fundamental pilot overhead limitations in high-dimensional beyond-5G and sixth-generation (6G) scenarios. This paper presents a hybrid tensor-neural architecture that formulates pilot-limited channel estimation as low-rank tensor completion from sparse observations -- a fundamentally different setting from prior tensor methods that assume fully observed received signal tensors. A canonical polyadic (CP) baseline implemented via a projection-based scheme (Tucker completion under partial observations) and Tucker decompositions are compared under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scattering conditions: CP performs well for specular channels matching the multipath model, while Tucker provides greater robustness under model mismatch. A lightweight three-dimensional (3D) U-Net learns residual components beyond the low-rank structure, bridging algebraic models and realistic propagation effects. Empirical recovery threshold analysis shows that sample complexity scales approximately with intrinsic model dimensionality $L(N_r + N_t + N_f)$ rather than ambient tensor size $N_r N_t N_f$, where $L$ denotes the number of dominant propagation paths. Experiments on synthetic channels demonstrate 10-20\,dB normalized mean-square error (NMSE) improvement over least-squares (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) baselines at 5-10\% pilot density, while evaluations on DeepMIMO ray-tracing channels show 24-44\% additional NMSE reduction over pure tensor-based methods.

Abstract: We present an uncertainty principle for graph signals in the vertex-time domain, unifying the classical time-frequency and graph uncertainty principles within a single framework. By defining vertex-time and spectral-frequency spreads, we quantify signal localization across these domains. Our framework identifies a class of signals that achieve maximum concentration in both the spatial and temporal domains. These signals serve as fundamental atoms for a new vertex-time dictionary, enhancing signal reconstruction under practical constraints, such as intermittent data commonly encountered in sensor and social networks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel graph topology inference method leveraging the uncertainty principle. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy, greater robustness to noise, and enhanced graph learning performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a semantic pilot design for data-aided channel estimation in text-inclusive data transmission, using a large language model (LLM). In this scenario, channel impairments often appear as typographical errors in the decoded text, which can be corrected using an LLM. The proposed method compares the initially decoded text with the LLM-corrected version to identify reliable decoded symbols. A set of selected symbols, referred to as a semantic pilot, is used as an additional pilot for data-aided channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to leverage semantic information for reliable symbol selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional pilot-only estimation, achieving lower normalized mean squared error and phase error of the estimated channel, as well as reduced bit error rate.

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution, and real-time DOA estimation is a cornerstone of environmental perception in automotive radar systems. While sparse signal recovery techniques offer super-resolution and high-precision estimation, their prohibitive computational complexity remains a primary bottleneck for practical deployment. This paper proposes a sparse DOA estimation scheme specifically tailored for the stringent requirements of automotive radar such as limited computational resources, restricted array apertures, and a single snapshot. By introducing the concept of the spatial angular pseudo-derivative and incorporating this property as a constraint into a standard L0-norm minimization problem, we formulate an objective function that more faithfully characterizes the physical properties of the DOA problem. The associated solver, designated as the SAPD search algorithm, naturally transforms the high-dimensional optimization task into an efficient grid-search scheme. The SAPD algorithm circumvents high-order matrix inversions and computationally intensive iterations. We provide an analysis of the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the SAPD method achieves a superior balance of real-time efficiency, high precision, and super-resolution, making it highly suitable for next-generation automotive radar applications.

Abstract: Electrochemical models offer superior interpretability and reliability for battery degradation diagnosis. However, the high computational cost of iterative parameter identification severely hinders the practical implementation of electrochemically informed state of health (SOH) estimation in real-time systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an SOH estimation method that integrates deep learning with electrochemical mechanisms and adopts a sequential training strategy. First, we construct a hybrid-driven surrogate model to learn internal electrochemical dynamics by fusing high-fidelity simulation data with physical constraints. This model subsequently serves as an accurate and differentiable physical kernel for voltage reconstruction. Then, we develop a self-supervised framework to train a parameter identification network by minimizing the voltage reconstruction error. The resulting model enables the non-iterative identification of aging parameters from external measurements. Finally, utilizing the identified parameters as physicochemical health indicators, we establish a high-precision SOH estimation network that leverages data-driven residual correction to compensate for identification deviations. Crucially, a sequential training strategy is applied across these modules to effectively mitigate convergence issues and improve the accuracy of each module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average voltage reconstruction root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0198 V and an SOH estimation RMSE of 0.0014.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a maneuverablejamming-aided secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (A2G-ISAC) system, where a dual-functional source UAV and a maneuverable jamming UAV operate collaboratively in a hybrid monostatic-bistatic radar configuration. The maneuverable jamming UAV emits artificial noise to assist the source UAV in detecting multiple ground targets while interfering with an eavesdropper. The effects of residual interference caused by imperfect successive interference cancellation on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are considered, which degrades the system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR) under transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraints, and sensing requirements, the dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming are jointly optimized. Given that secure communication and sensing fundamentally conflict in terms of resource allocation, making it difficult to achieve optimal performance for both simultaneously, we adopt a two-phase design to address this challenge. By dividing the mission into the secure communication (SC) phase and the SCS phase, the A2G-ISAC system can focus on optimizing distinct objectives separately. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm employing the trust-region successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation iteratively optimizes dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming. For the SCS phase, a weighted distance minimization problem determines the suitable dual-UAV sensing positions by a greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the highest ASR among benchmarks while maintaining robust sensing performance, and confirm the impact of the SIC residual interference on both secure communication and sensing.

Abstract: Traditional diagnosis of aortic valve disease relies on echocardiography, but its cost and required expertise limit its use in large-scale early screening. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease.

Abstract: With the rapid development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the design of integrated communication and navigation (ICAN) signals has attracted increasing attention, especially in the field of vehicle-to-everything (V2X). As a new-generation waveform, Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) features high robustness against Doppler effects, a simple modulation structure, and low pilot overhead, making it a promising candidate for high-dynamic LEO satellite scenarios. However, LEO-ICAN AFDM signals face challenges in fractional delay and Doppler frequency estimation. Existing studies that ignore its inherent spectrum wrapping phenomenon may lead to deviations of varying degrees in model construction. This paper conducts an in-depth derivation of AFDM's input-output relationship under fractional cases, reveals the envelope characteristics of its equivalent channel, and proposes a joint estimation algorithm based on peak-to-sidelobe power ratio (PSPR) detection and early-late gate (ELG) to estimate fractional Doppler frequency and delay. Simulations show that the algorithm has low complexity, low guard interval overhead, and high precision compared with traditional methods.

Abstract: Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) is a technique that relies on linearized error and input-output models to yield low-complexity solutions to complex estimation problems, which has been recently shown to be effective in the design of range-based GaBP schemes for stationary and moving rigid body localization (RBL) in three-dimensional (3D) space, as long as an accurate prior on the orientation of the target rigid body is available. In this article we present a novel range-based RBL scheme via GaBP that removes the latter limitation. To this end, the proposed method incorporates a quadratic angle approximation to linearize the relative orientation between the prior and the target rigid body, enabling high precision estimates of corresponding rotation angles even for large deviations. Leveraging the resulting linearized model, we derive the corresponding message-passing (MP) rules to obtain estimates of the translation vector and rotation matrix of the target rigid body, relative to a prior reference frame. Numerical results corroborate the good performance of the proposed angle approximation itself, as well as the consequent RBL performance in terms of root mean square errors (RMSEs) in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SotA), while maintaining a low computational complexity

Abstract: Persistent scatterer interferometry and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Tomography are powerful tools for the detection and time monitoring of persistent scatterers. They have been proven to be effective in urban scenarios, especially for buildings and infrastructures 3-D reconstruction and monitoring of deformation. In urban areas, occurrence of layover leads to the presence of multiple contributions within the same image pixel from scatterers located at different heights. In the context of SAR Tomography, this problem can be addressed by considering a multiple hypothesis test to detect the presence of feasible multiple scatterers [1][2]. In the present paper, we consider this problem in the framework of the information theory and exploit the theoretical tool, developed in [3], to design a one-stage adaptive architecture for multiple hypothesis testing problems in the context of SAR Tomography. Moreover, we resort to the compressive sensing approach for the estimation of the unknown parameters under each hypothesis. This architecture has been verified on both simulated as well as real data also in comparison with suitable counterparts.

Abstract: Block sparsity is a widely exploited structure in sparse recovery, offering significant gains when signal blocks are known. Yet, practical signals often exhibit unknown block boundaries and isolated non-zero entries, which challenge traditional approaches. A promising method to handle such complex sparsity patterns is the difference-of-logs total variation (DoL-TV) regularized sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). However, due to the complex form of DoL-TV term, the resulting optimization problem is hard to solve. This paper develops a new optimization framework for the DoL-TV SBL cost function. By introducing an exponential reparameterization of the SBL hyperparameters, we reveal a novel structure that admits a majorization-minimization formulation and naturally extends to unknown noise variance estimation. Sparse recovery results on both synthetic data and extended source direction-of-arrival estimation demonstrate improved accuracy and runtime performance compared to benchmark methods.

Abstract: The increasingly crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum forces communication signals to coexist, creating heterogeneous interferers whose structure often departs from Gaussian models. Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is critical for brain-computer interfaces and neuroscience, but the intrinsic noise and high dimensionality of EEG signals hinder effective feature learning. We propose a self-supervised framework based on the Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA), which learns orthonormal EEG representations by enforcing feature decorrelation and reducing redundancy. This design enables robust capture of essential brain dynamics for various EEG recognition tasks. We validate HFMCA on two benchmark datasets, SEED and BCIC-2A, where pretraining with HFMCA consistently outperforms competitive self-supervised baselines, achieving notable gains in classification accuracy. Across diverse EEG tasks, our method demonstrates superior cross-subject generalization under leave-one-subject-out validation, advancing state-of-the-art by 2.71\% on SEED emotion recognition and 2.57\% on BCIC-2A motor imagery classification.

Abstract: Beamforming in millimeter-wave (mmWave) high-mobility environments typically incurs substantial training overhead. While prior studies suggest that sub-6 GHz channels can be exploited to predict optimal mmWave beams, existing methods depend on large deep learning (DL) models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for sub-6 GHz channel-mmWave beam mapping based on the knowledge distillation (KD) technique. We develop two compact student DL architectures based on individual and relational distillation strategies, which retain only a few hidden layers yet closely mimic the performance of large teacher DL models. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed student models achieve the teacher's beam prediction accuracy and spectral efficiency while reducing trainable parameters and computational complexity by 99%.

Abstract: Channel charting (CC) has become a key technology for RF-based localization, enabling unsupervised radio fingerprinting, even in non line of sight scenarios, with a minimum of reference position labels. However, most CC models assume fixed-size inputs, such as a constant number of antennas or channel measurements. In practical systems, antennas may fail, signals may be blocked, or antenna sets may change during handovers, making fixed-input architectures fragile. Existing radio-fingerprinting approaches address this by training separate models for each antenna configuration, but the resulting training effort scales prohibitively with the array size. We propose Adaptive Positioning (AdaPos), a CC architecture that natively handles variable numbers of channel measurements. AdaPos combines convolutional feature extraction with a transformer-based encoder using learnable antenna identifiers and self-attention to fuse arbitrary subsets of CSI inputs. Experiments on two public real-world datasets (SISO and MIMO) show that AdaPos maintains state-of-the-art accuracy under missing-antenna conditions and replaces roughly 57 configuration-specific models with a single unified model. With AdaPos and our novel training strategies, we provide resilience to both individual antenna failures and full-array outages.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are revolutionizing the space sector, with on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming pivotal for next-generation satellites. AI acceleration is essential for safety-critical functions such as autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), where errors cannot be tolerated, and performance-critical processing of high-bandwidth sensor data, where occasional errors are tolerable. Consequently, AI accelerators for satellites must combine robust protection against radiation-induced faults with high throughput. This paper presents Safe-NEureka, a Hybrid Modular Redundant Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator for heterogeneous RISC-V systems. It operates in two modes: a redundancy mode utilizing Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) with hardware-based recovery, and a performance mode repurposing redundant datapaths to maximize parallel throughput. Furthermore, its memory interface is protected by Error Correction Codes (ECCs), and the controller by Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). Implementation in GlobalFoundries 12nm technology shows a 96 reduction in faulty executions in redundancy mode, with a manageable 15 area overhead. In performance mode, the architecture achieves near-baseline speeds on 3x3 dense convolutions with a 5 throughput and 11 efficiency reduction, compared to 48 and 53 in redundancy mode. This flexibility ensures high overheads are limited to critical tasks, establishing Safe-NEureka as a versatile solution for space applications.

Abstract: We study the policy synthesis problem in contextual partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs), where the environment is governed by an unknown latent context that induces distinct POMDP dynamics. Our goal is to design a policy that simultaneously maximizes cumulative return and actively reduces uncertainty about the underlying context. We introduce an information-directed objective that augments reward maximization with mutual information between the latent context and the agent's observations. We develop the C-IDS algorithm to synthesize policies that maximize the information-directed objective. We show that the objective can be interpreted as a Lagrangian relaxation of the linear information ratio and prove that the temperature parameter is an upper bound on the information ratio. Based on this characterization, we establish a sublinear Bayesian regret bound over K episodes. We evaluate our approach on a continuous Light-Dark environment and show that it consistently outperforms standard POMDP solvers that treat the unknown context as a latent state variable, achieving faster context identification and higher returns.

Hard safety constraints are enforced independently of the reward through action shielding and reachability-based admissible action sets, ensuring that unsafe behaviors are never intentionally selected during learning or execution. To capture nominal operation and recovery behavior within a single control architecture, the state space is partitioned into safe and unsafe regions based on membership in a safety box, and a mode-dependent reward is used to promote accurate tracking inside the safe region and recovery toward it when operating outside. To enable online tabular learning on continuous dynamics, a finite-state abstraction is constructed via state aggregation, and action selection and value updates are consistently restricted to admissible actions. The framework is demonstrated on a longitudinal point-mass hypersonic vehicle model with aerodynamic and propulsion couplings, using angle of attack and throttle as control inputs.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a powerful tool for enforcing safety constraints in control systems, but their direct application to complex, high-dimensional dynamics is often challenging. In many settings, safety certificates are more naturally designed for simplified or alternative system models that do not exactly match the dynamics of interest. This paper addresses the problem of transferring safety guarantees between dynamical systems with mismatched dynamics. We propose a transferred control barrier function (tCBF) framework that enables safety constraints defined on one system to be systematically enforced on another system using a simulation function and an explicit margin term. The resulting transferred barrier accounts for model mismatch and induces a safety condition that can be enforced on the target system via a quadratic-program-based safety filter. The proposed approach is general and does not require the two systems to share the same state dimension or dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on a quadrotor navigation task with the transferred barrier ensuring collision avoidance for the target system, while remaining minimally invasive to a nominal controller. These results highlight the potential of transferred control barrier functions as a general mechanism for enforcing safety across heterogeneous dynamical systems.

Abstract: The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has accelerated real-world deployment, while introducing new safety challenges arising from open-ended semantic reasoning and embodied physical action. These challenges require safety notions beyond physical constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we characterize FM-enabled robot safety along three dimensions: action safety (physical feasibility and constraint compliance), decision safety (semantic and contextual appropriateness), and human-centered safety (conformance to human intent, norms, and expectations). We argue that existing approaches, including static verification, monolithic controllers, and end-to-end learned policies, are insufficient in settings where tasks, environments, and human expectations are open-ended, long-tailed, and subject to adaptation over time. To address this gap, we propose modular safety guardrails, consisting of monitoring (evaluation) and intervention layers, as an architectural foundation for comprehensive safety across the autonomy stack. Beyond modularity, we highlight possible cross-layer co-design opportunities through representation alignment and conservatism allocation to enable faster, less conservative, and more effective safety enforcement. We call on the community to explore richer guardrail modules and principled co-design strategies to advance safe real-world physical AI deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

Abstract: The virtual admittance-current controller (VA-CC) scheme is widely employed to emulate an equivalent inductance in front of the internal voltage source of grid-forming inverters. However, recent studies have reported harmonic instabilities associated with VA-CC, motivating the need for a more physically interpretable understanding of their origin. This letter identifies a delay-independent structural mechanism of harmonic instability in the VA-CC scheme, wherein the interaction between the filter and virtual inductances introduces a non-passive second-order transfer-function term exhibiting negative resistance. To address this issue, a simple yet effective modification is proposed by integrating a parallel virtual resistor into the VA structure. This reconfiguration enhances the passivity of VA-CC scheme across the harmonic range by mimicking the skin effect which augments damping in high-frequency range, without altering the wellestablished current controller or voltage feedforward control. Experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves robust harmonic stability, whereas the conventional approach fails under identical grid conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates parameter-privacy-preserving data sharing in continuous-state dynamical systems, where a data owner designs a data-sharing policy to support downstream estimation and control while preventing adversarial inference of a sensitive parameter. This data-sharing problem is formulated as an optimization problem that trades off privacy leakage and the impact of data sharing on the data owner's utility, subject to a data-usability constraint. We show that this problem admits an equivalent belief Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, which provides a simplified representation of the optimal policy. To efficiently characterize information-theoretic privacy leakage in continuous state and action spaces, we propose a particle-belief MDP formulation that tracks the parameter posterior via sequential Monte Carlo, yielding a tractable belief-state approximation that converges asymptotically as the number of particles increases. We further derive a tractable closed-form upper bound on particle-based MI via Gaussian mixture approximations, which enables efficient optimization of the particle-belief MDP. Experiments on a mixed-autonomy platoon show that the learned continuous policy substantially impedes inference attacks on human-driving behavior parameters while maintaining data usability and system performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates bounds on the estimation error of a linear system affected by norm-bounded disturbances and full sensor attacks. The system is equipped with a detector that evaluates the norm of the innovation signal to detect faults, and the attacker wants to avoid detection. We utilize induced $L_\infty$ system norms, also called \emph{peak-to-peak} norms, to compare the estimation error bounds under nominal operations and under attack. This leads to a sufficient condition for when the bound on the estimation error is smaller during an attack than during nominal operation. This condition is independent of the attack strategy and depends only on the attacker's desire to remain undetected and (indirectly) the observer gain. Therefore, we investigate both an observer design method, that seeks to reduce the error bound under attack while keeping the nominal error bound low, and detector threshold tuning. As a numerical illustration, we show how a sensor attack can deactivate a robust safety filter based on control barrier functions if the attacked error bound is larger than the nominal one. We also statistically evaluate our observer design method and the effect of the detector threshold.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV), electric vehicles (EVs), and stationary energy storage systems (ESS) in households increases system complexity while simultaneously offering new opportunities for energy regulation. However, effectively coordinating these resources under uncertainties remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel home energy management framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can jointly minimise energy expenditure and battery degradation while guaranteeing occupant comfort and EV charging requirements. Distinct from existing studies, we explicitly account for the heterogeneous degradation characteristics of stationary and EV batteries in the optimisation, alongside stochastic user behaviour regarding arrival time, departure time, and driving distance. The energy scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and solved using a Lagrangian soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn optimal control policies that enforce physical constraints, including indoor temperature bounds and target EV state of charge upon departure, despite stochastic uncertainties. Numerical simulations over a one-year horizon demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in satisfying physical constraints while eliminating thermal oscillations and achieving significant economic benefits. Specifically, the method reduces the cumulative operating cost substantially compared to two standard rule-based baselines while simultaneously decreasing battery degradation costs by 8.44%.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a safe adaptive boundary control strategy for a class of parabolic partial differential equation-ordinary differential equation (PDE-ODE) cascaded systems with parametric uncertainties in both the PDE and ODE subsystems. The proposed design is built upon an adaptive Control Barrier Function (aCBF) framework that incorporates high-relative-degree CBFs together with a batch least-squares identification (BaLSI)-based adaptive control that guarantees exact parameter identification in finite time. The proposed control law ensures that: (i) if the system output state initially lies within a prescribed safe set, safety is maintained for all time; otherwise, the output is driven back into the safe region within a preassigned finite time; and (ii) convergence to zero of all plant states is achieved. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This work develops a robust nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for path tracking in autonomous vehicles operating at the limits of handling utilizing a Control Contraction Metric (CCM) derived from a perturbed dynamic single track model. We first present a nonlinear MPC scheme for autonomous vehicles. Building on this nominal scheme, we assume limited uncertainty in tire parameters as well as bounded force disturbances in both lateral and longitudinal directions. By simplifying the perturbed model, we optimize a CCM for the uncertain model, which is validated through simulations at the dynamic limits of vehicle performance. This CCM is subsequently employed to parameterize a homothetic tube used for constraint tightening within the MPC formulation. The resulting robust nonlinear MPC is computationally more efficient than competing methods, as it introduces only a single additional state variable into the prediction model compared to the nominal scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the homothetic tube expands most significantly in regions where the nominal scheme would otherwise violate constraints, illustrating its ability to capture all uncertain trajectories while avoiding unnecessary conservatism.

Abstract: Given a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF), Sontag's famous Formula provides a nonlinear state-feedback guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the setpoint. At the same time, a cost function that depends on the CLF is minimized. While there exist methods to construct CLFs for certain classes of systems, the impact on the resulting performance is unclear. This article aims to make two contributions to this problem: (1) We show that using the value function of an LQR design as CLF, the resulting Sontag-type controller minimizes a classical quadratic cost around the setpoint and a CLF-dependent cost within the domain where the CLF condition holds. We also show that the closed-loop system is stable within a local region at least as large as that generated by the LQR. (2) We show a related CLF design for feedback-linearizable systems resulting in a global CLF in a straight-forward manner; The Sontag design then guarantees global asymptotic stability while minimizing a quadratic cost at the setpoint and a CLF-dependent cost in the whole state-space. Both designs are constructive and easily applicable to nonlinear multi-input systems under mild assumptions.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Aerial Load Transport Systems (MAATS) offer greater payload capacity and fault tolerance than single-drone solutions. However, they have an underdetermined tension allocation problem that leads to uneven energy distribution, cable slack, or collisions between drones and cables. This paper presents a real-time optimization layer that improves a hierarchical load-position-attitude controller by incorporating a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm. The SQP formulation minimizes the sum of squared cable tensions while imposing a cable-alignment penalty that discourages small inter-cable angles, thereby preventing tether convergence without altering the reference trajectory. We tested the method under nominal conditions by running numerical simulations of four quadrotors. Computational experiments based on numerical simulations demonstrate that the SQP routine runs in a few milliseconds on standard hardware, indicating feasibility for real-time use. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the gain of the cable-alignment penalty can be tuned online, enabling a controllable trade-off between safety margin and energy consumption with no measurable degradation of tracking performance in simulation. This framework provides a scalable path to safe and energy-balanced cooperative load transport in practical deployments.

Abstract: We study strategic Gaussian semantic compression under rate and compute constraints, where an encoder and decoder optimize distinct quadratic objectives. A latent Gaussian state generates a task dependent semantic variable, and the decoder best responds via MMSE estimation, reducing the encoder's problem to posterior covariance design under an information rate constraint. We characterize the strategic rate distortion function in direct, remote, and full information regimes, derive semantic waterfilling and rate constrained Gaussian persuasion solutions, and establish Gaussian optimality under misaligned objectives. We further show that architectural compute limits act as implicit rate constraints, yielding exponential improvements in semantic accuracy with model depth and inference time compute, while multimodal observation eliminates the geometric mean penalty inherent to remote encoding. These results provide information theoretic foundations for data and energy efficient AI and offer a principled interpretation of modern multimodal language models as posterior design mechanisms under resource constraints.

Abstract: We propose a combinatorial bandit formulation to opportunistically trigger sleep modes in gNode-B (gNB) small cells (SCs), followed by a cell range expansion (CRE)-based load balancing procedure. This is implemented by ensuring that the fifth generation (5G) quality of service identifier (5QI)-requirements of user equipments (UEs) are maintained. The key challenge is the fact that while deactivating a given SC gNB reduces its own consumption, it may increase the load on neighboring gNBs and the macro gNB (coverage cell), impacting the overall energy efficiency. This phenomenon is accurately characterized by modeling the dynamic cell load that jointly takes into account the location of the UEs, their relative locations to all the SCs, and their data demands. We experimentally show that the proposed combinatorial upper confidence bound (CUCB) followed by the load balancer outperforms not only the naive strategies like arbitrarily keeping all the SCs on, but also other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solutions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as open-radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (NRT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) xApps.

Abstract: The game of coding is a new framework at the intersection of game theory and coding theory; designed to transcend the fundamental limitations of classical coding theory. While traditional coding theoretic schemes rely on a strict trust assumption, that honest nodes must outnumber adversarial ones to guarantee valid decoding, the game of coding leverages the economic rationality of actors to guarantee correctness and reliable decodability, even in the presence of an adversarial majority. This capability is paramount for emerging permissionless applications, particularly decentralized machine learning (DeML). However, prior investigations into the game of coding have been strictly confined to scalar computations, limiting their applicability to real world tasks where high dimensional data is the norm. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the framework to the general $N$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a rigorous problem formulation for vector valued computations and fully characterize the equilibrium strategies of the resulting high dimensional game. Our analysis demonstrates that the resilience properties established in the scalar setting are preserved in the vector regime, establishing a theoretical foundation for secure, large scale decentralized computing without honest majority assumptions.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems experience significant Doppler effects due to high mobility. While Doppler shifts can be largely compensated, residual frequency uncertainty induces a structured form of channel uncertainty that can limit achievable rates. We model this effect using a block-fading channel of the form $ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{F} + s \mathbf{G} $, where $s$ is an unknown scalar random parameter. We first study this model in a general $N\times N$ MIMO setting. For this channel, we derive achievable rate lower bounds based on explicit transmission schemes and capacity upper bounds using a duality approach. We study Gaussian signaling and propose a practical superposition scheme with subspace alignment (SN) and successive interference cancellation, where a coarse-layer stream serves as an implicit pilot for decoding refined-layer data. We characterize asymptotic capacity in the near-coherent and high-SNR regimes, and show via Doppler-OFDM simulations that the proposed SN scheme achieves near-optimal rates with low complexity.

Abstract: Latency anomalies, defined as persistent or transient increases in round-trip time (RTT), are common in residential Internet performance. When multiple users observe anomalies to the same destination, this may reflect shared infrastructure, routing behavior, or congestion. Inferring such shared behavior is challenging because anomaly magnitudes vary widely across devices, even within the same ISP and geographic area, and detailed network topology information is often unavailable.
  We study whether devices experiencing a shared latency anomaly observe similar changes in RTT magnitude using a topology-agnostic approach. Using four months of high-frequency RTT measurements from 99 residential probes in Chicago, we detect shared anomalies and analyze their consistency in amplitude and duration without relying on traceroutes or explicit path information. Building on prior change-point detection techniques, we find that many shared anomalies exhibit similar amplitude across users, particularly within the same ISP.
  Motivated by this observation, we design a sampling algorithm that reduces redundancy by selecting representative devices under user-defined constraints. Our approach captures 95 percent of aggregate anomaly impact using fewer than half of the deployed probes. Compared to two baselines, it identifies significantly more unique anomalies at comparable coverage levels. We further show that geographic diversity remains important when selecting probes within a single ISP, even at city scale. Overall, our results demonstrate that anomaly amplitude and duration provide effective topology-independent signals for scalable monitoring, troubleshooting, and cost-efficient sampling in residential Internet measurement.

Abstract: The agile mobility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) makes them ideal for low-altitude edge computing. This paper proposes a novel multi-tier UAV edge computing system where lightweight Low-Tier UAVs (L-UAVs) function as edge servers for vehicle users, supported by a powerful High-Tier UAV (H-UAV) acting as a backup server. The objective is to minimize task execution delays while ensuring the long-term energy stability of the L-UAVs, despite unknown future system states. To this end, the problem is decoupled using Lyapunov optimization, which adaptively balances the priorities of task delays and L-UAV energy cost based on their real-time energy states. An efficient vehicle to L-UAV matching scheme is designed, and the joint optimization problem for task assignment, computing resource allocation, and trajectory control of L-UAVs and H-UAV is then solved via a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction in L-UAV transmission energy of over 26% and superior L-UAV energy stability compared to existing benchmarks.

Abstract: This letter proposes a novel three-tier content caching architecture for Vehicular Fog Caching (VFC)-assisted platoon, where the VFC is formed by the vehicles driving near the platoon. The system strategically coordinates storage across local platoon vehicles, dynamic VFC clusters, and cloud server (CS) to minimize content retrieval latency. To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme.

Abstract: Emerging networked systems such as industrial IoT and real-time cyber-physical infrastructures demand intelligent scheduling strategies capable of adapting to dynamic traffic, deadlines, and interference constraints. In this work, we present a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework inspired by Dual Mind World Model (DMWM) architecture, for learning-informed and imagination-driven network control. Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines short-horizon predictive planning with symbolic model-based rollout, enabling the scheduler to anticipate future network states and adjust transmission decisions accordingly. We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency. The proposed design bridges the gap between network-level reasoning and low-overhead learning, marking a step toward scalable and adaptive NDT-based network optimization.

Abstract: Dual connectivity (DC) has garnered significant attention in 5G evolution, allowing for enhancing throughput and reliability by leveraging the channel conditions of two paths. However, when the paths exhibit different delays, such as in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks with multi-orbit topologies or in networks characterized by frequent topology changes, like Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations with different elevation angles, traffic delivery may experience packet reordering or triggering congestion control mechanisms. Additionally, real-time traffic may experience packet drops if their arrival exceeds a play-out threshold. Different techniques have been proposed to address these issues, such as packet duplication, packet switching, and network coding for traffic scheduling in DC. However, if not accurately designed, these techniques can lead to resource waste, encoding/decoding delays, and computational overhead, undermining DC's intended benefits. This paper provides a mathematical framework for calculating the average end-to-end packet loss in case of a loss process modeled with a Discrete Markov Chain - typical of a wireless channel - when combining packet duplication and packet switching or when network coding is employed in DC. Such metrics help derive optimal policies with full knowledge of the underlying loss process to be compared to empirical models learned through Machine Learning algorithms.

Abstract: Block space on the blockchain is scarce and must be allocated efficiently through block building. However, Ethereum's current block-building ecosystem, MEV-Boost, has become highly centralized due to integration, which distorts competition, reduces blockspace efficiency, and obscures MEV flow transparency. To guarantee equitability and economic efficiency in block building, we propose $\mathrm{Boost+}$, a system that decouples the process into collecting and ordering transactions, and ensures equal access to all collected transactions.
  The core of $\mathrm{Boost+}$ is the mechanism $\mathit{M}_{\mathrm{Boost+}}$, built around a default algorithm. $\mathit{M}_{\mathrm{Boost+}}$ aligns incentives for both searchers (intermediaries that generate or route transactions) and builders: Truthful bidding is a dominant strategy for all builders. For searchers, truthful reporting is dominant whenever the default algorithm dominates competing builders, and it remains dominant for all conflict-free transactions, even when builders may win. We further show that even if a searcher can technically integrate with a builder, non-integration combined with truthful bidding still dominates any deviation for conflict-free transactions. We also implement a concrete default algorithm informed by empirical analysis of real-world transactions and evaluate its efficacy using historical transaction data.

Because deployed smart contracts cannot be modified, correctness and security are paramount, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance and governance. Despite this growing reliance, the security implications of LLM-generated smart contracts remain insufficiently understood.
  In this work, we conduct a systematic security analysis of Solidity smart contracts generated by state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Sonnet. We evaluate these contracts against a broad set of known smart contract vulnerabilities to assess their suitability for direct deployment in production environments. Our extensive experimental study shows that, despite their syntactic correctness and functional completeness, LLM-generated smart contracts frequently exhibit severe security flaws that could be exploited in real-world settings. We further analyze and categorize these vulnerabilities, identifying recurring weakness patterns across different models. Finally, we discuss practical countermeasures and development guidelines to help mitigate these risks, offering actionable insights for both developers and researchers. Our findings aim to support safe integration of LLMs into smart contract development workflows and to strengthen the overall security of the blockchain ecosystem against future security failures.

Abstract: Gradient boosted decision trees, particularly XGBoost, are among the most effective methods for tabular data. As deployment in sensitive settings increases, cryptographic guarantees of model integrity become essential. We present ZKBoost, the first zero-knowledge proof of training (zkPoT) protocol for XGBoost, enabling model owners to prove correct training on a committed dataset without revealing data or parameters. We make three key contributions: (1) a fixed-point XGBoost implementation compatible with arithmetic circuits, enabling instantiation of efficient zkPoT, (2) a generic template of zkPoT for XGBoost, which can be instantiated with any general-purpose ZKP backend, and (3) vector oblivious linear evaluation (VOLE)-based instantiation resolving challenges in proving nonlinear fixed-point operations. Our fixed-point implementation matches standard XGBoost accuracy within 1\% while enabling practical zkPoT on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Denial-of-Service (DoS) conditions in enterprise networks are commonly attributed to malicious actors. However, availability can also be compromised by benign non-malicious insider behavior. This paper presents an empirical study of a production enterprise LAN that demonstrates how routine docking and undocking of user endpoints repeatedly trigger rapid recalculations of the control plane of the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) [1]. Although protocol-compliant and nonmalicious, these events introduce transient forwarding disruptions of approximately 2-4 seconds duration that degrade realtime streaming (voice and video) services while remaining largely undetected by conventional security monitoring. We map this phenomenon to the NIST and MITRE insider threat frameworks, characterizing it as an unintentional insider-driven availability breach, and demonstrate that explicit edge-port configuration effectively mitigates the condition without compromising loop prevention

Abstract: Cloud-native application platforms and latency-sensitive systems such as 5G Core networks rely heavily on certificate-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and mutual TLS to secure service-to-service communication. While effective, this model introduces significant operational and performance overhead, which is further amplified in the post-quantum setting due to large certificates and expensive signature verification. In this paper, we present a certificate-free authentication framework for private distributed systems based on post-quantum Identity-Based Encryption(IBE). Our design replaces certificate and signature based authentication with identity-derived keys and identity-based key encapsulation, enabling mutually authenticated TLS connections without certificate transmission or validation. We describe an IBE-based replacement for private PKI, including identity lifecycle management, and show how it can be instantiated using a threshold Private Key Generator (T-PKG). We apply this framework to cloud-native application deployments and latency-sensitive 5G Core networks. In particular, we demonstrate how identity-based TLS integrates with the 5G Service-Based Architecture while preserving security semantics and 3GPP requirements, and we show how the same architecture can replace private PKI in Kubernetes, including its control plane, without disrupting existing trust domains or deployment models.

Abstract: We prove the conjecture stated in Appendix F.3 of [Zhu et al. (2022)]: among all conversion rules that map a Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP) profile $τ\mapsto ρ(τ)$ to a valid hypothesis-testing trade-off $f$, the rule based on the intersection of single-order RDP privacy regions is optimal. This optimality holds simultaneously for all valid RDP profiles and for all Type I error levels $α$. Concretely, we show that in the space of trade-off functions, the tightest possible bound is $f_{ρ(\cdot)}(α) = \sup_{τ\geq 0.5} f_{τ,ρ(τ)}(α)$: the pointwise maximum of the single-order bounds for each RDP privacy region. Our proof unifies and sharpens the insights of [Balle et al. (2019)], [Asoodeh et al. (2021)], and [Zhu et al. (2022)]. Our analysis relies on a precise geometric characterization of the RDP privacy region, leveraging its convexity and the fact that its boundary is determined exclusively by Bernoulli mechanisms. Our results establish that the "intersection-of-RDP-privacy-regions" rule is not only valid, but optimal: no other black-box conversion can uniformly dominate it in the Blackwell sense, marking the fundamental limit of what can be inferred about a mechanism's privacy solely from its RDP guarantees.

Abstract: Open-weight language models are increasingly used in production settings, raising new security challenges. One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain.

Abstract: An exponential growth of Machine Learning and its Generative AI applications brings with it significant security challenges, often referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). In this paper, we conducted two comprehensive studies to explore the perspectives of industry professionals and students on different AML vulnerabilities and their educational strategies. In our first study, we conducted an online survey with professionals revealing a notable correlation between cybersecurity education and concern for AML threats. For our second study, we developed two CTF challenges that implement Natural Language Processing and Generative AI concepts and demonstrate a poisoning attack on the training data set. The effectiveness of these challenges was evaluated by surveying undergraduate and graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, finding that a CTF-based approach effectively engages interest in AML threats. Based on the responses of the participants in our research, we provide detailed recommendations emphasizing the critical need for integrated security education within the ML curriculum.
