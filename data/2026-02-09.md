### [1] [Know Your Scientist: KYC as Biosecurity Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06172)
*Jonathan Feldman,Tal Feldman,Annie I Anton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 快速生物AI技术需要新治理：三层KYC替代内容过滤，聚焦用户验证与行为监测，利用现有科研机构完善安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物AI在蛋白设计与结构预测快速发展，却缺乏有效防护；现有模型层级限制（关键词过滤、输出审查、内容封禁）难以覆盖尚未实现的精准功能预测或新型威胁。

Method: 采用金融反洗钱的三层架构：I层依托科研机构信托验证；II层通过序列同源搜索与功能注释进行输出筛选；III层监测行为模式检出异常。

Result: 该框架可即时使用现有机构基础设施，未需立法或新规章，既保障合法科研，又通过机构账户追踪和监测降低滥用门槛。

Conclusion: 提出三层KYC框架以治理生物AI工具的双重使用风险，强调对用户身份与行为监测，而非仅内容检查；实现合法研究获取与误用成本提升并存。

Abstract: Biological AI tools for protein design and structure prediction are advancing rapidly, creating dual-use risks that existing safeguards cannot adequately address. Current model-level restrictions, including keyword filtering, output screening, and content-based access denials, are fundamentally ill-suited to biology, where reliable function prediction remains beyond reach and novel threats evade detection by design. We propose a three-tier Know Your Customer (KYC) framework, inspired by anti-money laundering (AML) practices in the financial sector, that shifts governance from content inspection to user verification and monitoring. Tier I leverages research institutions as trust anchors to vouch for affiliated researchers and assume responsibility for vetting. Tier II applies output screening through sequence homology searches and functional annotation. Tier III monitors behavioral patterns to detect anomalies inconsistent with declared research purposes. This layered approach preserves access for legitimate researchers while raising the cost of misuse through institutional accountability and traceability. The framework can be implemented immediately using existing institutional infrastructure, requiring no new legislation or regulatory mandates.

### [2] [AdFL: In-Browser Federated Learning for Online Advertisement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06336)
*Ahmad Alemari,Pritam Sen,Cristian Borcea*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdFL利用浏览器中的联邦学习与差分隐私，快速捕获广告相关特征，预测准确率高，且无需安装额外软件，符合隐私法规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在各国普遍推行在线隐私法规的背景下，发布商需要平衡广告收益与用户隐私；联邦学习可在不共享原始数据的前提下实现定向广告。

Method: 通过在浏览器中执行分布式模型训练，收集可用的浏览器特征（如广告可见度、点击率、停留时长等），将本地模型参数经差分隐私保密后上传到服务器进行聚合。

Result: 在40k每日访客的两组独立数据集上，AdFL模型预测广告可见度达92.59% AUC；差分隐私后性能下降有限，证明隐私保护与预测能力兼得。

Conclusion: AdFL能够在网页浏览器内实现联邦学习，既满足GDPR等隐私法规，又能提供高质量的定向广告预测，展示了其在实际流量环境下的可行性与效果。

Abstract: Since most countries are coming up with online privacy regulations, such as GDPR in the EU, online publishers need to find a balance between revenue from targeted advertisement and user privacy. One way to be able to still show targeted ads, based on user personal and behavioral information, is to employ Federated Learning (FL), which performs distributed learning across users without sharing user raw data with other stakeholders in the publishing ecosystem. This paper presents AdFL, an FL framework that works in the browsers to learn user ad preferences. These preferences are aggregated in a global FL model, which is then used in the browsers to show more relevant ads to users. AdFL can work with any model that uses features available in the browser such as ad viewability, ad click-through, user dwell time on pages, and page content. The AdFL server runs at the publisher and coordinates the learning process for the users who browse pages on the publisher's website. The AdFL prototype does not require the client to install any software, as it is built utilizing standard APIs available on most modern browsers. We built a proof-of-concept model for ad viewability prediction that runs on top of AdFL. We tested AdFL and the model with two non-overlapping datasets from a website with 40K visitors per day. The experiments demonstrate AdFL's feasibility to capture the training information in the browser in a few milliseconds, show that the ad viewability prediction achieves up to 92.59% AUC, and indicate that utilizing differential privacy (DP) to safeguard local model parameters yields adequate performance, with only modest declines in comparison to the non-DP variant.

### [3] [VENOMREC: Cross-Modal Interactive Poisoning for Targeted Promotion in Multimodal LLM Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06409)
*Guowei Guan,Yurong Hao,Jiaming Zhang,Tiantong Wu,Fuyao Zhang,Tianxiang Chen,Longtao Huang,Cyril Leung,Wei Yang Bryan Lim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文发现并量化跨模态投毒风险，并提出VENOMREC方法显著提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态共识虽可缓解单模态注入攻击，但未发现跨模态同步投毒的威胁。

Method: 提出VENOMREC，通过曝光对齐识别联合嵌入空间中的高曝光区，并使用跨模态交互扰动生成关注引导的令牌-补丁编辑。

Result: 在三大真实多模态数据集上，VENOMREC平均达0.73 ER@20，比最强基线提升0.52 ER点，并保持推荐效果。

Conclusion: 跨模态交互式投毒在多模态大语言模型的推荐系统中形成了新的攻击面，且可通过同步投毒可靠地引导融合表示沿稳定语义方向演化。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are pushing recommender systems (RecSys) toward content-grounded retrieval and ranking via cross-modal fusion. We find that while cross-modal consensus often mitigates conventional poisoning that manipulates interaction logs or perturbs a single modality, it also introduces a new attack surface where synchronised multimodal poisoning can reliably steer fused representations along stable semantic directions during fine-tuning. To characterise this threat, we formalise cross-modal interactive poisoning and propose VENOMREC, which performs Exposure Alignment to identify high-exposure regions in the joint embedding space and Cross-modal Interactive Perturbation to craft attention-guided coupled token-patch edits. Experiments on three real-world multimodal datasets demonstrate that VENOMREC consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.73 mean ER@20 and improving over the strongest baseline by +0.52 absolute ER points on average, while maintaining comparable recommendation utility.

Abstract: The sharing of the last-level cache (LLC) among multiple cores makes it vulnerable to cross-core conflict- and occupancy-based attacks. Despite extensive prior work, modern processors still employ non-secure set-associative LLCs. Existing secure LLC designs broadly fall into two categories: (i) randomized and (ii) partitioned. The state-of-the-art randomized design, Mirage, mitigates conflict-based attacks but incurs significant area overhead (20% additional storage) and design complexity. Partitioned LLCs mitigate both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks, but often suffer from large performance overheads (on average over 5% and up to 49%), require OS support in set-based schemes, or face scalability issues in way-based schemes. These factors pose major obstacles to the industrial adoption of secure LLCs. This paper asks whether strong LLC security can be achieved with minimal changes to a conventional set-associative LLC, enabling security only when needed while preserving low performance, power, and area overheads. We propose Avatar, a secure and morphable LLC that supports three modes: non-secure (Avatar-N), randomized secure (Avatar-R), and partitioned secure (Avatar-P), and can switch dynamically between them. Avatar closely resembles a conventional set-associative LLC, facilitating industrial adoption. Avatar-R introduces extra invalid entries and leverages high associativity to provide a strong security guarantee with little capacity loss, achieving only one set-associative eviction per $10^{30}$ years, while incurring 1.5% storage overhead, a 2.7% increase in static power, and a 0.2% slowdown over a 16~MB baseline. Avatar-P mitigates both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks with only a 3% performance overhead, substantially outperforming prior way-based partitioned LLCs. When security is unnecessary, Avatar switches to Avatar-N to maximize performance and energy efficiency.

### [5] [Subgraph Reconstruction Attacks on Graph RAG Deployments with Practical Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06495)
*Minkyoo Song,Jaehan Kim,Myungchul Kang,Hanna Kim,Seungwon Shin,Sooel Son*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 针对Graph RAG提出GRASP攻击方法，显著提高子图重建精度；同时提出两种轻量安全防御可有效降低泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph RAG在增强LLM应用中使用知识图，但对恶意攻击的隐私泄露风险认知不足，现有攻击方法在实际安全约束下效果不佳。

Method: 将图子图重建转化为上下文处理任务；通过记录标识符强制输出符合格式并降低幻觉；使用动量感知调度器在查询预算内多轮生成多样化攻击查询。

Result: 在两份真实知识图、四个安全对齐LLM和多种Graph RAG框架下，GRASP实现最高类型忠实度重建，F1最高达82.9。

Conclusion: GRASP是一种高效的闭盒子图子图重建攻击方法，能在安全约束下显著提高Graph RAG的隐私泄露风险，并且两种轻量化防御能有效降低重建精度而不损失系统性能。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph RAG) is increasingly deployed to support LLM applications by augmenting user queries with structured knowledge retrieved from a knowledge graph. While Graph RAG improves relational reasoning, it introduces a largely understudied threat: adversaries can reconstruct subgraphs from a target RAG system's knowledge graph, enabling privacy inference and replication of curated knowledge assets. We show that existing attacks are largely ineffective against Graph RAG even with simple prompt-based safeguards, because these attacks expose explicit exfiltration intent and are therefore easily suppressed by lightweight safe prompts. We identify three technical challenges for practical Graph RAG extraction under realistic safeguards and introduce GRASP, a closed-box, multi-turn subgraph reconstruction attack. GRASP (i) reframes extraction as a context-processing task, (ii) enforces format-compliant, instance-grounded outputs via per-record identifiers to reduce hallucinations and preserve relational details, and (iii) diversifies goal-driven attack queries using a momentum-aware scheduler to operate within strict query budgets. Across two real-world knowledge graphs, four safety-aligned LLMs, and multiple Graph RAG frameworks, GRASP attains the strongest type-faithful reconstruction where prior methods fail, reaching up to 82.9 F1. We further evaluate defenses and propose two lightweight mitigations that substantially reduce reconstruction fidelity without utility loss.

### [6] [Sequential Auditing for f-Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06518)
*Tim Kutta,Martin Dunsche,Yu Wei,Vassilis Zikas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 新颖的自适应 $f$-DP 审计器，既无须预设样本量，又能覆盖完整隐私范围，适用于白盒、黑盒及单次实验，减少了样本成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP 审计器批量处理且需预设样本树，容易导致样本浪费；需要在更通用的 $f$-DP 参数化隐私中提供精确、低成本的检测方案。

Method: 采用基于输出样本的批量无偏估计，自适应地确定所需样本数；支持白盒、黑盒及单次运行框架。

Result: 审计器能够检测整个隐私曲线上的违例，在理论与仿真上给出显著性保证，并显著降低了所需的样本量，尤其对 DP‑SGD 等昂贵训练过程有显著意义。

Conclusion: 本文提出了针对$f$-DP隐私概念的自适应实验性审计器，实现了在不同隐私阈值下的显著性检测，并无需预设样本量。

Abstract: We present new auditors to assess Differential Privacy (DP) of an algorithm based on output samples. Such empirical auditors are common to check for algorithmic correctness and implementation bugs. Most existing auditors are batch-based or targeted toward the traditional notion of $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP; typically both. In this work, we shift the focus to the highly expressive privacy concept of $f$-DP, in which the entire privacy behavior is captured by a single tradeoff curve. Our auditors detect violations across the full privacy spectrum with statistical significance guarantees, which are supported by theory and simulations. Most importantly, and in contrast to prior work, our auditors do not require a user-specified sample size as an input. Rather, they adaptively determine a near-optimal number of samples needed to reach a decision, thereby avoiding the excessively large sample sizes common in many auditing studies. This reduction in sampling cost becomes especially beneficial for expensive training procedures such as DP-SGD. Our method supports both whitebox and blackbox settings and can also be executed in single-run frameworks.

### [7] [Dependable Artificial Intelligence with Reliability and Security (DAIReS): A Unified Syndrome Decoding Approach for Hallucination and Backdoor Trigger Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06532)
*Hema Karnam Surendrababu,Nithin Nagaraj*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Syndrome Decoding 适配 NLP 嵌入空间，既能发现训练集中的后门攻击，也能识别 LLM 的幻觉输出，提供了一种统一的安全与可靠性检测工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML 模型在安全与可靠性方面易受多种攻击与错误行为影响，尤其是后门攻击与 LLM 幻觉给最终用户带来不可预测的风险，亟需一种统一的检测机制。

Method: 在 NLP 句子嵌入空间中适配 Syndrome Decoding 方法，利用其对样本的判别能力区分受污染与未受污染的训练数据；同样的框架可用于识别 LLM 在自指元解释任务中产生的幻觉文本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在检测后门中毒样本上具有高准确率，并能有效捕捉 LLM 在元解释任务中产生的 hallucinated 内容。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于 Syndrome Decoding 的统一方法能够同时检测机器学习模型中的安全缺陷（后门数据中毒）与可靠性问题（LLM 产生的幻觉），为人工智能系统的安全可靠性提供了有效的监测手段。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), are characterized by a range of system-level attributes such as security and reliability. Recent studies have demonstrated that ML models are vulnerable to multiple forms of security violations, among which backdoor data-poisoning attacks represent a particularly insidious threat, enabling unauthorized model behavior and systematic misclassification. In parallel, deficiencies in model reliability can manifest as hallucinations in LLMs, leading to unpredictable outputs and substantial risks for end users. In this work on Dependable Artificial Intelligence with Reliability and Security (DAIReS), we propose a novel unified approach based on Syndrome Decoding for the detection of both security and reliability violations in learning-based systems. Specifically, we adapt the syndrome decoding approach to the NLP sentence-embedding space, enabling the discrimination of poisoned and non-poisoned samples within ML training datasets. Additionally, the same methodology can effectively detect hallucinated content due to self referential meta explanation tasks in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全方案无法有效应对 VANET 中的恶意内鬼攻击，迫切需要可靠的信任管理模型。

Method: 首先对已有的信任模型进行归类和总结，其次通过序列图对发送方与接收方评估机制进行对比分析。

Result: 提出两大类信任模型：接收方评估与发送方评估，分析各自的计算负载与决策速度，并指出在实时性与效能方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 文献综述得出，发送方信任评估法在 VANET 中更具实时性和效率，建议未来在该方向进行深入研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a survey of state-of-the-art trust models for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Trust management plays an essential role in isolating malicious insider attacks in VANETs which traditional security approaches fail to thwart. To this end, many trust models are presented; some of them only address trust management, while others address security and privacy aspects besides trust management. This paper first reviews, classifies, and summarizes state-of-the-art trust models, and then compares their achievements. From this literature survey, our reader will easily identify two broad classes of trust models that exist in literature, differing primarily in their evaluation point. For example, most trust models follow receiver-side trust evaluation and to the best of our knowledge, there is only one trust model for VANETs which evaluates trust at the sender-side unless a dispute arises. In the presence of a dispute, a Roadside Unit (RSU) rules on the validity of an event. In receiver-side trust models, each receiver becomes busy while computing the trust of a sender and its messages upon the messages' arrival. Conversely, in the sender-side class, receivers are free from any kind of computation as the trust is verified at the time the message is announced. Also, vehicles can quickly act on the information, such as taking a detour to an alternate route, as it supports fast decision-making. We provide a comparison between these two evaluation techniques using a sequence diagram. We then conclude the survey by suggesting future work for sender-side evaluation of trust in VANETs. Additionally, the challenges (real-time constraints and efficiency) are emphasized whilst considering the deployment of a trust model in VANETs

Abstract: As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) become mega-constellations critical infrastructure, attacks targeting them have grown in number and range. The security analysis of LEO constellations faces a fundamental paradigm gap: traditional topology-centric methods fail to capture systemic risks arising from dynamic load imbalances and high-order dependencies, which can transform localized failures into network-wide cascades. To address this, we propose HYDRA, a hypergraph-based dynamic risk analysis framework. Its core is a novel metric, Hyper-Bridge Centrality (HBC), which quantifies node criticality via a load-to-redundancy ratio within dependency structures. A primary challenge to resilience: the most critical vulnerabilities are not in the densely connected satellite core, but in the seemingly marginal ground-space interfaces. These are the system's "Black Swan" nodes--topologically peripheral yet structurally lethal. We validate this through extensive simulations using realistic StarLink TLE data and population-based gravity model. Experiments demonstrate that HBC consistently outperforms traditional metrics, identifying critical failure points that surpass the structural damage potential of even betweenness centrality. This work shifts the security paradigm from connectivity to structural stress, demonstrating that securing the network edge is paramount and necessitates a fundamental redesign of redundancy strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, where its reference-grounded design makes outputs appear trustworthy. This trust has spurred research on poisoning attacks that craft malicious content, inject it into knowledge sources, and manipulate RAG responses. However, when evaluated in practical RAG systems, existing attacks suffer from severely degraded effectiveness. This gap stems from two overlooked realities: (i) content is often processed before use, which can fragment the poison and weaken its effect, and (ii) users often do not issue the exact queries anticipated during attack design. These factors can lead practitioners to underestimate risks and develop a false sense of security. To better characterize the threat to practical systems, we present Confundo, a learning-to-poison framework that fine-tunes a large language model as a poison generator to achieve high effectiveness, robustness, and stealthiness. Confundo provides a unified framework supporting multiple attack objectives, demonstrated by manipulating factual correctness, inducing biased opinions, and triggering hallucinations. By addressing these overlooked challenges, Confundo consistently outperforms a wide range of purpose-built attacks across datasets and RAG configurations by large margins, even in the presence of defenses. Beyond exposing vulnerabilities, we also present a defensive use case that protects web content from unauthorized incorporation into RAG systems via scraping, with no impact on user experience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Suffix-based jailbreak attacks append an adversarial suffix, i.e., a short token sequence, to steer aligned LLMs into unsafe outputs. Since suffixes are free-form text, they admit endlessly many surface forms, making jailbreak mitigation difficult. Most existing defenses depend on passive detection of suspicious suffixes, without leveraging the defender's inherent asymmetric ability to inject secrets and proactively conceal gaps. Motivated by this, we take a controllability-oriented perspective and develop a proactive defense that nudges attackers into a no-win dilemma: either they fall into defender-designed optimization traps and fail to produce an effective adversarial suffix, or they can succeed only by generating adversarial suffixes that carry distinctive, traceable fingerprints. We propose TrapSuffix, a lightweight fine-tuning approach that injects trap-aligned behaviors into the base model without changing the inference pipeline. TrapSuffix channels jailbreak attempts into these two outcomes by reshaping the model's response landscape to adversarial suffixes. Across diverse suffix-based jailbreak settings, TrapSuffix reduces the average attack success rate to below 0.01 percent and achieves an average tracing success rate of 87.9 percent, providing both strong defense and reliable traceability. It introduces no inference-time overhead and incurs negligible memory cost, requiring only 15.87 MB of additional memory on average, whereas state-of-the-art LLM-based detection defenses typically incur memory overheads at the 1e4 MB level, while composing naturally with existing filtering-based defenses for complementary protection.

TL;DR: Wonderboom：将签名聚合速度提升32倍，单时隙可聚合200万+签名，比现有方案更安全满足百万级验证者需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethereum 采用数百万验证者，导致区块最终确定耗时约15分钟，现有签名聚合与传播协议存在安全漏洞，攻击者可把权重从诚实验证者转向恶意验证者。需要更快、更安全的聚合方案。

Method: 提出 Wonderboom——首个百万级聚合协议，能够在单个以太坊时隙内聚合数百万签名，速度提升约32倍，并提供比现行协议更高的安全保障。同时实现首个可在百万级规模下模拟该协议的仿真工具。

Result: 在最坏情况下，Wonderboom 能在单个时隙内聚合并验证超过200万签名，验证速度提升32倍；仿真结果表明该方案兼顾了速度与安全性。

Conclusion: Wonderboom 在签名聚合方面显著提升速度与安全性，打破以太坊当前因汇聚成本导致的15分钟延迟瓶颈，为大规模共识提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Over the last years, Ethereum has evolved into a public platform that safeguards the savings of hundreds of millions of people and secures more than $650 billion in assets, placing it among the top 25 stock exchanges worldwide in market capitalization, ahead of Singapore, Mexico, and Thailand. As such, the performance and security of the Ethereum blockchain are not only of theoretical interest, but also carry significant global economic implications. At the time of writing, the Ethereum platform is collectively secured by almost one million validators highlighting its decentralized nature and underlining its economic security guarantees. However, due to this large validator set, the protocol takes around 15 minutes to finalize a block which is prohibitively slow for many real world applications. This delay is largely driven by the cost of aggregating and disseminating signatures across a validator set of this scale. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, the existing protocol that is used to aggregate and disseminate the signatures has several shortcomings that can be exploited by adversaries to shift stake proportion from honest to adversarial nodes. In this paper, we introduce Wonderboom, the first million scale aggregation protocol that can efficiently aggregate the signatures of millions of validators in a single Ethereum slot (x32 faster) while offering higher security guarantees than the state of the art protocol used in Ethereum. Furthermore, to evaluate Wonderboom, we implement the first simulation tool that can simulate such a protocol on the million scale and show that even in the worst case Wonderboom can aggregate and verify more than 2 million signatures within a single Ethereum slot.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in vulnerability detection. However, a critical reliability gap persists: models frequently yield correct detection verdicts based on hallucinated logic or superficial patterns that deviate from the actual root cause. This misalignment remains largely obscured because contemporary benchmarks predominantly prioritize coarse-grained classification metrics, lacking the granular ground truth required to evaluate the underlying reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we first construct a benchmark consisting of two datasets: (1) real-world vulnerabilities with expert-curated causal reasoning as ground truth, and (2) semantically equivalent code perturbations for assessing reasoning robustness. Our large-scale empirical study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain logical consistency during semantic code comprehension, exhibiting 12 systematic failure patterns. Addressing these limitations, we propose DAGVul, a novel framework that models vulnerability reasoning as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) generation task. Unlike linear chain-of-thought (CoT), our approach explicitly maps causal dependencies to enforce structural consistency. By further introducing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we align model reasoning trace with program-intrinsic logic. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves the reasoning F1-score by an average of 18.9% over all the baselines. Remarkably, our 8B-parameter implementation not only outperforms existing models of comparable scale but also surpasses specialized large-scale reasoning models, including Qwen3-30B-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B-High. It is even competitive with state-of-the-art models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (75.47% vs. 76.11%), establishing new efficiency in vulnerability reasoning across model scales.

*Ying Song,Balaji Palanisamy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Taipan通过转移式、无查询攻击成功对多属性进行推断，说明公开图数据本身就存在大规模泄漏风险，需要更严格的隐私措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文指出现有属性推断攻击(AIAs)主要依赖可重复查询模型，然而在实际场景中受限的查询预算、法规约束及多重属性推断需求使得此类攻击不切实际。同时，公开发布的图本身就可能导致多重敏感信息泄露，现有研究对此缺乏关注。

Method: 提出首个无查询转移式攻击框架Taipan，结合Hierarchical Attack Knowledge Routing捕捉属性间复杂关联，并采用Prompt-guided Attack Prototype Refinement降低负迁移与性能下降。

Result: 在多种真实图数据集上，Taipan在相同分布、异构相似以及分布偏离场景均表现出强劲的攻击效果，即便在差分隐私（DP）约束下仍有效。

Conclusion: 揭示了公开图数据的隐私缺陷，强调需要开发更鲁棒的多属性隐私保护及数据共享方案。

Abstract: Graph-structured data underpin a wide spectrum of modern applications. However, complex graph topologies and homophilic patterns can facilitate attribute inference attacks (AIAs) by enabling sensitive information leakage to propagate across local neighborhoods. Existing AIAs predominantly assume that adversaries can probe sensitive attributes through repeated model queries. Such assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings due to stringent data protection regulations, prohibitive query budgets, and heightened detection risks, especially when inferring multiple sensitive attributes. More critically, this model-centric perspective obscures a pervasive blind spot: \textbf{intrinsic multiple sensitive information leakage arising solely from publicly released graphs.} To exploit this unexplored vulnerability, we introduce a new attack paradigm and propose \textbf{Taipan, the first query-free transfer-based attack framework for multiple sensitive attribute inference attacks on graphs (G-MSAIAs).} Taipan integrates \emph{Hierarchical Attack Knowledge Routing} to capture intricate inter-attribute correlations, and \emph{Prompt-guided Attack Prototype Refinement} to mitigate negative transfer and performance degradation. We further present a systematic evaluation framework tailored to G-MSAIAs. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world graph datasets demonstrate that Taipan consistently achieves strong attack performance across same-distribution settings and heterogeneous similar- and out-of-distribution settings with mismatched feature dimensionalities, and remains effective even under rigorous differential privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust multi-attribute privacy-preserving graph publishing methods and data-sharing practices.

Result: 13种LLM引用误报率介于14.23%至94.93%；人工文献中1.07%论文含无效或伪造引用（604篇），2025年单年增幅80.9%；调查显示41.5%研究者不检查BibTeX，44.4%遇到可疑引用不行动；76.7%评审不细查引用，80%未怀疑伪造引用；指出人工核查缺口和AI工具风险加剧，建议多方干预

Conclusion: AI工具与人类缺乏核查造成引用腐败，需完善验证机制、会议审稿与工具开发以保护引用完整性

Abstract: Citations provide the basis for trusting scientific claims; when they are invalid or fabricated, this trust collapses. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), this risk has intensified: LLMs are increasingly used for academic writing, yet their tendency to fabricate citations (``ghost citations'') poses a systemic threat to citation validity.
  To quantify this threat and inform mitigation, we develop CiteVerifier, an open-source framework for large-scale citation verification, and conduct the first comprehensive study of citation validity in the LLM era through three experiments built on it. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art LLMs on citation generation across 40 research domains, finding that all models hallucinate citations at rates from 14.23\% to 94.93\%, with significant variation across research domains. Moreover, we analyze 2.2 million citations from 56,381 papers published at top-tier AI/ML and Security venues (2020--2025), confirming that 1.07\% of papers contain invalid or fabricated citations (604 papers), with an 80.9\% increase in 2025 alone. Furthermore, we survey 97 researchers and analyze 94 valid responses after removing 3 conflicting samples, revealing a critical ``verification gap'': 41.5\% of researchers copy-paste BibTeX without checking and 44.4\% choose no-action responses when encountering suspicious references; meanwhile, 76.7\% of reviewers do not thoroughly check references and 80.0\% never suspect fake citations. Our findings reveal an accelerating crisis where unreliable AI tools, combined with inadequate human verification by researchers and insufficient peer review scrutiny, enable fabricated citations to contaminate the scientific record. We propose interventions for researchers, venues, and tool developers to protect citation integrity.

TL;DR: CPRVul通过精细化上下文筛选与LLM推理提升漏洞检测性能，显著优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅在函数级别预测漏洞，忽视跨过程上下文的影响；加入冗长、噪声多的真实上下文往往适得其反，亟需精炼有效上下文的方法。

Method: 使用代码属性图提取候选上下文，LLM生成安全侧重点概况并评分，选择高影响力上下文后与目标函数及元数据生成推理轨迹，用以微调LLM进行基于推理的检测。

Result: 在PrimeVul、TitanVul和CleanVul三大数据集上，CPRVul的准确率分别提高至64.94%–73.76%，其中PrimeVul提升22.9%从55.17%至67.78%。

Conclusion: CPRVul通过上下文剖析与结构化推理显著提升漏洞检测准确率，优于单函数级别基线。

Abstract: Recent progress in ML and LLMs has improved vulnerability detection, and recent datasets have reduced label noise and unrelated code changes. However, most existing approaches still operate at the function level, where models are asked to predict whether a single function is vulnerable without inter-procedural context. In practice, vulnerability presence and root cause often depend on contextual information. Naively appending such context is not a reliable solution: real-world context is long, redundant, and noisy, and we find that unstructured context frequently degrades the performance of strong fine-tuned code models.
  We present CPRVul, a context-aware vulnerability detection framework that couples Context Profiling and Selection with Structured Reasoning. CPRVul constructs a code property graph, and extracts candidate context. It then uses an LLM to generate security-focused profiles and assign relevance scores, selecting only high-impact contextual elements that fit within the model's context window. In the second phase, CPRVul integrates the target function, the selected context, and auxiliary vulnerability metadata to generate reasoning traces, which are used to fine-tune LLMs for reasoning-based vulnerability detection.
  We evaluate CPRVul on three high-quality vulnerability datasets: PrimeVul, TitanVul, and CleanVul. Across all datasets, CPRVul consistently outperforms function-only baselines, achieving accuracies ranging from 64.94% to 73.76%, compared to 56.65% to 63.68% for UniXcoder. Specifically, on the challenging PrimeVul benchmark, CPRVul achieves 67.78% accuracy, outperforming prior state-of-the-art approaches, improving accuracy from 55.17% to 67.78% (22.9% improvement). Our ablations further show that neither raw context nor processed context alone benefits strong code models; gains emerge only when processed context is paired with structured reasoning.

Motivation: 缺乏对LLM水印的统一理论与原则性描述，现有方案多为经验性设计，无法系统比较与定制化。

Method: 利用受限优化问题，将不同水印方案视为在相同目标函数（如探测功率）下对不同约束（如质量、多样性等）的最优解，并通过构造合适的约束项来推导新的水印。

Result: 构造的优越水印在实验中在各约束条件下都实现了最佳探测功率，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文通过统一的受限优化框架阐明并重建了现有LLM水印方法，揭示了质量-多样性-探测功率之间的权衡，并验证了基于该框架得到的水印方案在相应约束下具有最优的探测功率。

Abstract: LLM watermarks allow tracing AI-generated texts by inserting a detectable signal into their generated content. Recent works have proposed a wide range of watermarking algorithms, each with distinct designs, usually built using a bottom-up approach. Crucially, there is no general and principled formulation for LLM watermarking.
  In this work, we show that most existing and widely used watermarking schemes can in fact be derived from a principled constrained optimization problem. Our formulation unifies existing watermarking methods and explicitly reveals the constraints that each method optimizes. In particular, it highlights an understudied quality-diversity-power trade-off. At the same time, our framework also provides a principled approach for designing novel watermarking schemes tailored to specific requirements. For instance, it allows us to directly use perplexity as a proxy for quality, and derive new schemes that are optimal with respect to this constraint. Our experimental evaluation validates our framework: watermarking schemes derived from a given constraint consistently maximize detection power with respect to that constraint.

TL;DR: 研究了完全自适应下的 \(f\)-DP 过滤器，发现自然方法无效且给出有效性条件；提出自适应CLT并设计更优Gaussian DP过滤器，在低/高采样率下性能优于Rényi DP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全自适应构成下，如何保证整体隐私预算不被超额，是 DP 的核心难题；尤其是 \(f\)-DP 等基于 Trade-off 函数的概念是否可在此框架下实现有效过滤尚不清楚。

Method: 通过分解个体退化曲线并分析其在完全自适应交互中的累积表现，确定自然过滤器失效的机制；随后构造了自适应CLT并利用其推导 Gaussian DP 的近似过滤器；在低/高采样率场景下对其性能进行评估与比较。

Result: 证明自然 \(f\)-DP 过滤器的失效原因，给出必要与充分条件；确立了自适应 CLT；在 \(q<0.2\) 与 \(q>0.8\) 的情况下，构造了更强的 Gaussian DP 过滤器，优于 Rényi DP 过滤器。

Conclusion: 阐明了在完全自适应交互中，基于 \(f\)-DP 的自然过滤器在何种情况下有效，提供了必要与充分条件，并提出了完整自适应中心极限定理及对应的高精度近似Gaussian DP过滤器；在小/大采样率下此过滤器优于基于 Rényi DP 的过滤器。

Abstract: Accounting for privacy loss under fully adaptive composition -- where both the choice of mechanisms and their privacy parameters may depend on the entire history of prior outputs -- is a central challenge in differential privacy (DP). In this setting, privacy filters are stopping rules for compositions that ensure a prescribed global privacy budget is not exceeded. It remains unclear whether optimal trade-off-function-based notions, such as $f$-DP, admit valid privacy filters under fully adaptive interaction. We show that the natural approach to defining an $f$-DP filter -- composing individual trade-off curves and stopping when the prescribed $f$-DP curve is crossed -- is fundamentally invalid. We characterise when and why this failure occurs, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the natural filter is valid. Furthermore, we prove a fully adaptive central limit theorem for $f$-DP and construct an approximate Gaussian DP filter for subsampled Gaussian mechanisms at small sampling rates $q<0.2$ and large sampling rates $q>0.8$, yielding tighter privacy guarantees than filters based on Rényi DP in the same setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视NES的安全影响，缺乏对其机制与攻击向量的深入探讨。

Method: 系统性安全研究：1）机制剖析发现可扩展上下文带来新威胁；2）实验室评估检测上下文中毒和交易编辑敏感性；3）在线调查评估开发者的安全认知。

Result: NES易受上下文中毒攻击，对交易编辑与人机交互敏感；调查显示开发者普遍缺乏安全意识，亟需教育与对策。

Conclusion: NES的改进显著提升生产力，但同时放大了潜在攻击面，需加强安全防护与教育。

Abstract: Modern AI-integrated IDEs are shifting from passive code completion to proactive Next Edit Suggestions (NES). Unlike traditional autocompletion, NES is designed to construct a richer context from both recent user interactions and the broader codebase to suggest multi-line, cross-line, or even cross-file modifications. This evolution significantly streamlines the programming workflow into a tab-by-tab interaction and enhances developer productivity. Consequently, NES introduces a more complex context retrieval mechanism and sophisticated interaction patterns. However, existing studies focus almost exclusively on the security implications of standalone LLM-based code generation, ignoring the potential attack vectors posed by NES in modern AI-integrated IDEs. The underlying mechanisms of NES remain under-explored, and their security implications are not yet fully understood.
  In this paper, we conduct the first systematic security study of NES systems. First, we perform an in-depth dissection of the NES mechanisms to understand the newly introduced threat vectors. It is found that NES retrieves a significantly expanded context, including inputs from imperceptible user actions and global codebase retrieval, which increases the attack surfaces. Second, we conduct a comprehensive in-lab study to evaluate the security implications of NES. The evaluation results reveal that NES is susceptible to context poisoning and is sensitive to transactional edits and human-IDE interactions. Third, we perform a large-scale online survey involving over 200 professional developers to assess the perceptions of NES security risks in real-world development workflows. The survey results indicate a general lack of awareness regarding the potential security pitfalls associated with NES, highlighting the need for increased education and improved security countermeasures in AI-integrated IDEs.

Motivation: 针对传统入侵检测系统在日志异质性、高误报率、语义盲点及数据稀缺等方面的局限，提出利用大语言模型对多源日志进行异常检测，提高检测精度与效率。

Method: ①构建LogAtlas-Foundation-Sessions与LogAtlas-Defense-Set两套均衡、异质且公开攻击标注、隐私保护的日志数据集；②通过经验对比揭示F1、准确率等常规指标在安全场景下的误导性；③设计双阶段训练框架：先以3B参数的Base-AMAN进行日志语义理解，再通过知识蒸馏压缩为0.5B参数的AMAN进行实时检测。

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，结合大语言模型与知识蒸馏的双阶段框架能显著降低误报并兼顾实时性，在异质日志场景下具备可推广的应用前景。

Abstract: This project explores large language models (LLMs) for anomaly detection across heterogeneous log sources. Traditional intrusion detection systems suffer from high false positive rates, semantic blindness, and data scarcity, as logs are inherently sensitive, making clean datasets rare. We address these challenges through three contributions: (1) LogAtlas-Foundation-Sessions and LogAtlas-Defense-Set, balanced and heterogeneous log datasets with explicit attack annotations and privacy preservation; (2) empirical benchmarking revealing why standard metrics such as F1 and accuracy are misleading for security applications; and (3) a two phase training framework combining log understanding (Base-AMAN, 3B parameters) with real time detection (AMAN, 0.5B parameters via knowledge distillation). Results demonstrate practical feasibility, with inference times of 0.3-0.5 seconds per session and operational costs below 50 USD per day.

TL;DR: PROTOPURIFY 是一种基于参数编辑的后门净化框架，利用原型匹配与局部抑制实现高效反后门，能够 1）在多模型和攻击类型上稳健；2）将攻击成功率降至 1.6% 以下；3）保留 97% 以上原始模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 在安全敏感应用中的广泛使用导致方向性的后门攻击威胁，而现有的防护手段难以在 BDaaS 场景中实际运营，须要更多可复用、可扩展且对侧信息需求极低的方案。

Method: 通过构建清洁与受后门模型对的 Backdoor 向量池，聚合为候选原型；使用相似度匹配选定与目标模型最契合的原型；识别层级边界后，在受影响层抑制原型对齐分量，完成精细化的逐层反后门修正。

Result: 在多类 LLM 和任务（分类/生成）上相对六种代表性防御方法进行实验，PROTOPURIFY 在单触发、多触发与无触发后门场景下持续领先，攻击成功率被压至低于10%，部分情况达1.6%，同时正常性能下降不足3%；对抗自适应后门亦表现鲁棒，且对未受后门的模型无负面影响。

Conclusion: PROTOPURIFY 提供了一种高效、可重用且对抗适应性变种的 LLM 反后门修复方案，兼顾安全性与性能，已在多种攻击和模型上展示出显著优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. However, existing backdoor defenses are difficult to operationalize for Backdoor Defense-as-a-Service (BDaaS), as they require unrealistic side information (e.g., downstream clean data, known triggers/targets, or task domain specifics), and lack reusable, scalable purification across diverse backdoored models. In this paper, we present PROTOPURIFY, a backdoor purification framework via parameter edits under minimal assumptions. PROTOPURIFY first builds a backdoor vector pool from clean and backdoored model pairs, aggregates vectors into candidate prototypes, and selects the most aligned candidate for the target model via similarity matching. PROTOPURIFY then identifies a boundary layer through layer-wise prototype alignment and performs targeted purification by suppressing prototype-aligned components in the affected layers, achieving fine-grained mitigation with minimal impact on benign utility. Designed as a BDaaS-ready primitive, PROTOPURIFY supports reusability, customizability, interpretability, and runtime efficiency. Experiments across various LLMs on both classification and generation tasks show that PROTOPURIFY consistently outperforms 6 representative defenses against 6 diverse attacks, including single-trigger, multi-trigger, and triggerless backdoor settings. PROTOPURIFY reduces ASR to below 10%, and even as low as 1.6% in some cases, while incurring less than a 3% drop in clean utility. PROTOPURIFY further demonstrates robustness against adaptive backdoor variants and stability on non-backdoored models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型即将被广泛部署，缺乏标准化的 tamper resistance 评估方法导致不同模型、攻击与防御难以比较，亟需统一基准。

Method: 构建了包含权重空间与潜在空间攻击的仓库，采用系统化的参数搜索对每个模型-攻击组合进行评估，并提供安全及实用性指标，支持添加自定义 fine‑tuning 与对齐阶段防御。

Result: 在 21 个公开权重 LLM（含防御增强版）上，评测 9 种攻击，发现后训练能提升抗 tamper 性；“jailbreak-tuning”最致命；Triplet 对齐阶段防御表现最佳，提供了多条新见解。

Conclusion: TamperBench 为大型语言模型(tamper resistance) 提供了统一评估框架，揭示了不同攻击与防御的效果，为安全研究者与工程师提供可重复、可比的基准。

Abstract: As increasingly capable open-weight large language models (LLMs) are deployed, improving their tamper resistance against unsafe modifications, whether accidental or intentional, becomes critical to minimize risks. However, there is no standard approach to evaluate tamper resistance. Varied data sets, metrics, and tampering configurations make it difficult to compare safety, utility, and robustness across different models and defenses. To this end, we introduce TamperBench, the first unified framework to systematically evaluate the tamper resistance of LLMs. TamperBench (i) curates a repository of state-of-the-art weight-space fine-tuning attacks and latent-space representation attacks; (ii) enables realistic adversarial evaluation through systematic hyperparameter sweeps per attack-model pair; and (iii) provides both safety and utility evaluations. TamperBench requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning configuration, alignment-stage defense method, and metric suite while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We use TamperBench to evaluate 21 open-weight LLMs, including defense-augmented variants, across nine tampering threats using standardized safety and capability metrics with hyperparameter sweeps per model-attack pair. This yields novel insights, including effects of post-training on tamper resistance, that jailbreak-tuning is typically the most severe attack, and that Triplet emerges as a leading alignment-stage defense.

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects. This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_θ$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.

Motivation: 传统 LLM 以概率最大化为驱动，易产生流利但不完整、非可信答案，不符合 AI 安全原则，需引入可验证、完整的推理机制。

Method: EVE将高难度推理拆分为抽取、验证、枚举三个阶段，形成可追踪、可核实的生成管道；避免单次自由生成导致的遗漏与生成截断。

Result: 相较于自由提示，EVE 在召回率提升24%，精准度提升29%，F1 分数提升31%，实现覆盖率与精度的同步提升，并减少因长度限制导致的截断。

Conclusion: EVE通过结构化、可验证的推理流程显著提升 LLM 的完整性与可信度，打破了传统单次生成的覆盖率与准确率权衡，并显示出在自然语言固有歧义下的性能饱和界限。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many engineering and scientific workflows rely on expensive black‑box evaluations that need both performance improvement and uncertainty reduction. Existing Bayesian optimization and Bayesian experimental design treat goal‑seeking and information‑seeking separately, offering little guidance when the two are intertwined.


Method: Introduce "pragmatic curiosity", a hybrid learning‑optimization framework based on active inference. Actions are chosen by minimizing expected free energy, which unifies pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain.


Result: On real‑world hybrid tasks—constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences—pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO‑type and BED‑type baselines, achieving higher estimation accuracy, better critical‑region coverage, and improved final solution quality.


Conclusion: A single expected‑free‑energy objective effectively couples learning and optimization, enabling robust performance in hybrid settings where information and utility objectives coexist.


Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

Method: 设计并实施针对LR与NN的白盒与黑盒泄露攻击，评估LORIS以及其他浅层NN在不同攻击场景下的脆弱性；随后提出基于张量秩分解的张量训练（TT）防御方案，并验证其对攻击的鲁棒性与准确性保持。

Result: 实验显示LR在白盒攻击下泄露严重；传统交叉验证进一步放大风险。张量化防御能完全混淆参数，将攻击提升至随机猜测级别，并与差分隐私同等抑制黑盒攻击，同时保持原始准确性并提升解释能力。

Conclusion: 通过张量化实现的量子启发式防御可有效抑制白盒培训数据泄露，并在保持准确性的同时显著提高模型隐私和可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.

Result: 在LLaMA‑2/3上超越竞争方法，在多压缩比例下精度更高；比单纯深度或宽度剪枝更优；实现40%压缩时整体延迟下降39%；将MoP应用LLaVA‑1.5提升算力，且仅用文本恢复微调即可恢复视觉任务性能

Conclusion: MoP统一深度与宽度剪枝，开创新的结构化剪枝前沿，既提升模型精度又产生实用速度提升

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

TL;DR: Tempora提出时间约束严苛的TTA评估框架，揭示传统表现与实际部署不可直接对照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA评估忽视处理时间限制，无法反映在延迟敏感、用户触发场景中的真实性能；需通过时间约束来衡量准确度-延迟权衡。

Method: 引入三类时限约束评估方案（硬截止异步流、延迟衰减交互式、预算摊销）与相应效用指标，对ImageNet‑C上的七种TTA方法在240个时间场景下进行实验。

Result: 实验显示传统排名在时间压迫下排名易翻转，经典ETA方法在约41.2%的评估中表现差；最高效用方法因噪声类型和时间压力而不同，没有明显的统治者。

Conclusion: Tempora框架可系统评估TTA在不同时间压力下的表现，暴露传统评估与实际部署的差距；不同TTA方法在各类时间约束下表现不一，未出现统一的奖杯。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

TL;DR: 论文通过理论与示例展示：在tamed Gibbs策略下Q学习可能稳定但PBE不唯一；在其他策略下甚至无解，强调需更多结构以保证算法收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在此前研究显示特定条件下Q学习稳定与PBE解存在的基础上，探讨这些结论在更广泛设定（非表格或线性MDP）中的适用性。

Method: 对不同变体的Q学习在可避避策略、贪婪策略等情形下做理论分析与构造一维示例，演示解的存在性与唯一性问题。

Result: 给出一个基函数理想且真正的Q函数属于基函数范围，但在贪婪及tamed Gibbs策略下可出现两组PBE解，说明仅凭基函数并不足以确保收敛。

Conclusion: 论文证明在使用$\varepsilon$-tamed Gibbs策略的线性Q学习中，存在PBE的解但未能保证其唯一性，并指出在更一般的启发式策略下可能出现多解或无解，从而算法不稳定。

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

Motivation: 传统 MoE 在选择专家后需完整执行，导致精度与计算开销之间存在离散跳跃，难以在不同资源约束下灵活调整。

Method: 在稀疏路由的基础上，MoSE为每个专家构建嵌套的可瘦模型，并采用多宽度训练结合标准 MoE 损失进行稳定训练；推理时通过路由器输出和自适应宽度确定机制（包括轻量级测试时训练）在固定预算下映射专家宽度。

Result: 在基于 OpenWebText 训练的 GPT 模型上，MoSE 在完整宽度下与标准 MoE 性能相同或更优；在不同宽度设置下，MoSE 的精度-成本 Pareto 前沿显著向上移动，显著降低 FLOPs。

Conclusion: MoSE通过在每个专家内部加入可变宽度的稀疏可扩展结构，使得单一训练好的MoE模型能够在推理时连续、细粒度地切换精度-计算的折衷，从而在相同或更低的 FLOPs 下保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

Motivation: LLM 训练瓶颈为矩阵乘法，尤其是 FFN 部分占比高，需寻找速度提升方案。

Method: 在 FFN 中采用 2:4 权重稀疏、v:n:m 激活稀疏，结合稀疏训练阶段与最终密集训练段。

Result: 实验显示采用稀疏方案训练得到的模型在质量基准上无显著下降，并实现整体训练速度提升 1.4–1.7 倍，兼容 NVIDIA A100 及其后世 GPU。

Conclusion: 利用稀疏性技术，Transformer 训练可加速 1.4–1.7 倍，性能保持不变。

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

Result: 实验证明此方法比简单重新训练显著加速，且对模型效用影响极小。

Conclusion: 提出的联邦忘却框架能高效、实用地实现数据移除，为联邦场景提供可扩展的隐私保护与安全防护。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

Motivation: LoRA 参数高效微调存在训练动态复杂且学习率需随秩重调的困扰，缺乏指导如何合理缩放学习率。

Method: 构建 μA 理论，借鉴 μP 预训练参数化，结合超参数迁移技术，分析初始化与 LoRA 缩放因子对学习率缩放模式的影响，确定两种学习率缩放区间。

Result: 实验验证在语言、视觉、视觉–语言、图像生成和强化学习等任务上，最优学习率随秩的缩放规律与 μA 预期一致，且在全微调场景中学习率可直接迁移，效果稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的 Maximal-Update Adaptation（μA）框架能够精准预测 LoRA 在不同适配器秩下的最优学习率，并实现学习率从 LoRA 迁移到完整微调，从而显著降低调参成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

Conclusion: GCPA为多模型对齐提供了一种统一、可扩展且在检索任务中性能稳定的方式

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained neural networks converge to increasingly similar latent spaces. However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.

Conclusion: SR4-Fit 在预测选举结果和其他公开数据集上均优于传统黑盒模型和现有可解释规则算法，兼顾准确性、可解释性与稳健性。

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

Conclusion: RuleSmith 能通过多智能体LLM自我模拟与贝叶斯优化，实现高效自动化游戏平衡，并生成可直接应用的可解释规则调整。

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

Result: 在离散（tabular）设置下，PEPO仅依赖单策略浓度系数，获得样本复杂度上界；理论分析与实证结果均显示其优于传统DPO的性能

Conclusion: PEPO在维持直接偏好优化(DPO)简洁实用性的同时，以悲观集成机制缓解过度优化，提供了理论保证与实验验证的有效方案

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations of laser welding capture complex thermo-fluid phenomena, including phase change, free-surface deformation, and keyhole dynamics, however their computational cost limits large-scale process exploration and real-time use. In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.

TL;DR: REBEL基于进化的对抗提示能深入测试LLM去学习，实验显示现有方法不足，泄漏率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准指标不足以发现隐藏的已学习内容，需更严苛的评估方法以验证去学习真实效果。

Method: 采用进化算法生成对抗性提示，用于检验模型在去学习后是否能恢复目标知识。

Result: 在TOFU上最高60%攻击成功率，WMDP上93%，显著优于静态基线；展示了目前去学习方案对保护的表层化偏误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM去学习方法在标准评估下表现良好，但对更强的对抗性提示仍易泄露被遗忘信息，REBEL能显著提升检测和攻击成功率。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

*Navita Goyal,Hal Daumé*

TL;DR: 构建三维特异性评估框架，对两类安全任务验证 steering 方法，发现其在稳健性上缺失，提示需完整评估以保障模型安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模语言模型中实现控制的轻量级办法（模型驱动）需要评估干预是否仅改变目标属性而未影响其它行为。现有评估缺乏针对潜在附带影响的系统性分析。

Method: 提出三维特异性框架（一般性、控制性、稳健性），并在两类安全关键用例（减轻过度拒绝和减少虚假信息）中对多种 steering 方法进行评估。

Result: 实验显示 steering 能显著提升目标属性控制，且在一般性和控制性特异性上保持不变，却在稳健性特异性上失效，导致模型更易被“jailbreak”。

Conclusion: 仅靠效能与一般性/控制性特异性检验并不足以保证安全应用；必须加入稳健性评估以防止模型安全性受损。

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

Motivation: 安全对齐的脆弱性在模型部署后易被轻易破坏，现有方法需大量标注数据且会显著削弱模型效能。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 对安全约束进行直接消减。

Result: 在六种实用性基准和五种安全基准上，GRP-Oblit在 15 个 7-20B 参数模型（如 GPT-OSS、DeepSeek、Gemma 等）上实现平均更优的失效，且有效保持模型在例子、推理及图像生成任务中的性能。

Conclusion: GRP-Oblit能用少量无标签提示有效去除已对齐模型的安全约束，同时保持大部分模型实用性，并在多种架构上展现出相对更强的失效效果。

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing different notions of swap regret in online optimization. These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $Ω(d^4 \sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.
  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $Ω(d \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

Result: 在强白盒确定性攻击下，新方法显著优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: 确定性净化既能提供可靠测试准确率，又能在理论上保证对抗鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Motivation: 在扩散模型中，需要有效阻止有害内容生成，单纯移除概念会导致模型保留性下降或缺乏鲁棒性，亟需兼顾二者的技术方案。

Conclusion: AEGIS在保持模型有用性不变的同时，可显著提升对概念再激活攻击的鲁棒性，解决了传统方法中鲁棒性与保留性冲突的问题。

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

Motivation: 在大规模语言模型中，稀疏注意力是降低自回归推理成本的关键。传统的硬 LSH 难以进行有效的排名，需改进。

Method: 提出 SOCKET，使用软 LSH 通过概率化的相似度聚合代替硬桶匹配，实现更稳定的 top‑k 排序，并利用自定义 CUDA 与 Flash Decode 后端。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准检验中，SOCKET 与或超过现有稀疏注意力基线；与 FlashAttention 相比吞吐率提升至 1.5×。

Conclusion: SOCKET 将 LSH 转化为可理论化的稀疏注意力得分核，显著提升长文本推理效率。

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

Motivation: 降低 Transformer 的 quadratic 计算瓶颈，探究在实际模型中注意力稀疏是否为学习可捕获的拓扑模式，而不是硬性架构假设。

Method: 通过实证分析 GPT-2、Pythia、Qwen2 等模型的注意力分布，定义 Condensate Manifold（Anchor+Window+Dynamic Top‑k），证明该投影可实现 100% 输出等价且无近似。

Result: 在 1,500+ 生成 token 上实现精准 token 对齐；在 131K token 时速度提升 159 倍，推理成本降低 99.9%；在 1M token 下预计可达 1,200 倍加速。

Conclusion: 本文认为注意力稀疏是可学习的拓扑特性，而非架构限制，证明了通过投影到Condensate拓扑可完全复现全 O(n²) 注意力，且大幅提升推理速度和成本。

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

Abstract: Epidemiological forecasting from surveillance data is a hard problem and hybridizing mechanistic compartmental models with neural models is a natural direction. The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.

TL;DR: TFER通过自由能的Push–Pull机制，将忘却类转化为Ood样本，实现参数高效、边界保留的unlearning；既保持剩余类性能，又提升OOD检测，对灾难性遗忘具备天然鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界环境下部署可信AI需同时保证稳健的OOD检测与灵活的模型忘却；传统的分类导向unlearning会破坏OOD检测所依赖的紧凑数据流形，导致无法同时满足安全与隐私合规的双重需求。

Method: 对目标类别的unlearning等价于把它们视为OOD样本，构建TFER（Total Free Energy Repulsion）框架：①利用free energy原理设计Pull机制将保留类拉入低能ID流形；②通过Push机制将被遗忘类推入高能OOD区，形成Push-Pull平衡；③采用参数高效微调而非全量重训，降低计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，TFER在精准忘却指定类别的同时，最大化保留类的判别性能，并且对外部OOD数据保持高检测准确率；其Push-Pull平衡机制赋予模型结构稳定性，使其在持续unlearning任务中显著抵御灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: TFER框架通过引入自由能促使模型在忘却特定类别的同时，将其有效迁移至OOD空间，从而在保持Remaining类判别力并对外部OOD保持鲁棒性的前提下，实现了参数高效的边界保留式unlearning；其Push-Pull机制不仅简化了传统方法的复杂约束，也显著提升了模型对灾难性遗忘的抗压能力。

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

Motivation: 在实际场景中，学习者往往只能获得带宽反馈且面对未知对手，传统的外部遗憾在此设置下不可避免。研究如何在零和博弈中以只观察到实现行动的收益的 Bandit 反馈下，最小化相对最大最小策略的缺口，即 Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret。

Method: 针对两种 Bandit 反馈模型（未知模型仅知奖励，知情模型同时知奖励和对手行动），提出对应算法：在未知模型下使用 Tsallis-INF 证明实例相关 $O(c\log T)$ 上界并给出信息下界；在知情模型下提出 Maximin-UCB 同样获得 $O(c'\log T)$ 上界。之后推广至大规模动作集的双线性博弈，分别给出 Tsallis-FTRL-SPM 与 Maximin-LinUCB。

Result: 1) Tsallis-INF 在未知 Bandit 下实现实例相关的 $O(c\log T)$ 外部遗憾，并证明对 $c$ 的依赖是必要的。2) Maximin-UCB 在知情 Bandit 下实现更优可能的 $O(c'\log T)$。3) 对双线性游戏的推广保持相同的对游戏参数的对数界。

Conclusion: 通过结合信息下界与实例相关分析，证明在 Bandit 反馈环境下仍可实现对 Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret 的对数收敛，并提出实用算法可适用于大规模动作集。

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

Conclusion: ERDF利用标签相关性提高特征表示，并通过精选特征复用机制保证训练稳定性，最终在六项评估指标上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further.

### [58] [Evaluating LLM-persona Generated Distributions for Decision-making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06357)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM能生成实用决策分布，决策导向评估比传统距离度量更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM生成的数据是否能为定价、品类组合与新鲜货存量决策提供可靠支持。

Method: 采用LLM-SAA方法，先用LLM仿真生成分布，再在该分布下进行决策优化，并使用决策导向的指标评估分布质量。

Result: 在组合优化、定价与新闻摊位问题上，LLM生成的分布在实践中表现良好，尤其在数据稀缺时效果显著；而基于Wasserstein距离等无决策意义的指标往往误导。

Conclusion: LLM生成的分布在低数据环境下能有效支持决策，且可通过决策结果评估其质量。

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

Motivation: 合成表格数据在共享敏感记录时需兼顾分布保真、下游效用与隐私安全，本工作寻求一种模型无关、易实现的后处理方法，以平衡这三者。

Method: 先对缺失或稀疏类别进行模式修补，随后采用k近邻滤波器剔除与真实样本距离不足的合成记录，从而实现数据的分布修正和隐私增强。

Result: 在三大公开数据集上，阈值0.2–0.35可使类别分布差异降低36%，关联性保持提升10–14%，且平均预测性能差距仅1%；隐私指标如最近邻距离提升，属性推断成功率基本不变。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的后处理框架能够在保持模型性能和分布相似性的前提下，显著提高合成表格数据的质量和隐私保护，为实际应用提供可操作的阈值选择和修复策略。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We study distributed adversarial bandits, where $N$ agents cooperate to minimize the global average loss while observing only their own local losses. We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $ρ$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\tilde{O}(ρ^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $ρ^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent EEG signals in emotion recognition and enhance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Method: An enhanced hybrid model integrating convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, self-attention mechanisms, and regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting.

Result: The proposed model outperforms classical machine learning and neural baselines on a publicly available EEG dataset (neutral, positive, negative), with statistical validation across cross-validation folds and feature-level analysis highlighting the importance of covariance-based inter-channel relationships.

Conclusion: Hybrid deep learning architectures that combine convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components significantly improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data, achieving state-of-the-art results and offering better interpretability than classical baselines.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) projects rely on complex networks of contributors whose interactions drive innovation and sustainability. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Motivation: 梯度上升用于逆向训练以实现数据遗忘，然而易导致模型性能严重退化。需要一种既能安全不泄露数据又不损害模型整体能力的失忆方法。

Method: 先用梯度下降训练出记忆模型，使其在保留数据上的预测保持一致，同时能够记忆待删除数据；随后通过模型外推，将该记忆模型在假设空间中推迟到原始模型位置，得到遗忘模型。

Result: 实验表明，该外推方案在多项基准任务上显著提升了失忆效果，且总体训练过程更为稳定，避免了原先梯度上升出现的崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 模型外推方法为机器失忆提供了一种更稳定的替代方案，避免了梯度上升导致的灾难性崩溃，并在保持模型性能的前提下实现了对敏感数据的有效消除。

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

TL;DR: BrokenBind binds modalities across disjoint datasets by generating pseudo‑embeddings, overcoming dataset bias and data scarcity, and surpassing standard multimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint‑embedding methods are biased toward modalities present in a single dataset, limiting generalization to unseen modalities and incurring high data acquisition costs. BrokenBind addresses this by enabling modality binding across separate datasets.

Method: Leveraging multiple datasets that share a common modality, BrokenBind learns relationships between non‑aligned modalities, then uses these relations to create pseudo embeddings that fill missing modalities, enabling flexible multimodal binding regardless of dataset overlap.

Result: Experiments show BrokenBind outperforms well‑known multimodal baselines, achieving superior performance even in intensified scenarios with more than two datasets and in low‑data regimes.

Conclusion: BrokenBind demonstrates that it is possible to bind modalities across independent datasets by generating pseudo‑embeddings, leading to improved generalization and lower data requirements compared with traditional joint‑embedding approaches.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

Result: 实验表明PCR显著平滑训练轨迹，且在多种推理任务中实现优于基准的表现。

Conclusion: PCR通过不确定性感知的软投影有效缓解GRPO训练中的几何冲突，显著提升训练稳定性和推理任务性能。

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

Conclusion: 本研究针对在线双层优化（Online Bilevel Optimization, OBO）阐明了标准双层局部回撤（bilevel local regret）与窗口平均局部回撤（window-averaged bilevel local regret）的最优回撤界限，并给出了相应最优算法。

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Result: 在多样基准上实验表明，该方法提升了推理性能及泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过因果反事实视角设计奖励，可有效引导LLM关注合理且稳健的推理流程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

Conclusion: Uncertainty‑Aware Tree Search（UATS）通过估计不确定性并动态分配计算资源，可在推理阶段显著降低因外部搜索使用过程奖励模型（PRM）产生的错误，实现在偏差解决中的子线性回报增长。

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

TL;DR: EvoMAS通过进化配置生成方法，显著提升多智能体系统的性能与可靠性，优于传统人工设计与其他自动生成技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化多智能体系统生成方法要么依赖代码生成（易出现可执行性和鲁棒性问题），要么使用僵化的模板限制了表达力与适应性，亟需一种更灵活、高效且可靠的生成方式。

Method: 将多智能体系统的生成建模为结构化配置生成，采用进化算法在配置空间中演化：从配置池中挑选初始配置，基于执行轨迹的反馈进行变异和交叉，并迭代更新候选池和经验记忆。

Result: 在 BBEH、SWE‑Bench 及 WorkBench 等多样化基准上，EvoMAS均优于人类设计的 MAS 与之前的自动化方法；在 BBEH 推理上超过 EvoAgent 10.5 分，在 WorkBench 上超过 7.1 分；并在 SWE‑Bench‑Verified 以 79.1% 的成绩与排行榜顶尖水平持平。

Conclusion: EvoMAS通过在配置空间中的进化方法，显著提升了多智能体系统的生成效果，既提高了任务表现，又增强了可执行性和运行时鲁棒性，优于人工设计和先前自动生成方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

Abstract: We present a novel topography scanning system developed to XLPE cable core monitoring. Modern measurement technology is utilized together with embedded high-performance computing to build a complete and detailed 3D surface map of the insulated core.

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

Motivation: 传统正则化无法清晰区分有用特征与噪声，现有对抗适配方法需要显式分离标签，限制了在实验噪声严重、数据稀缺的材料科学场景中的应用。

Method: 提出自监督对抗机制与多层特征分离架构，实现任务相关特征与噪声的统计独立，并通过层级递归恢复被误判为噪声的特征。

Result: 在多组实验和真实材料设计任务中，AdverISF超越现有最优方法，尤其在数据不足时表现更为突出。

Conclusion: AdverISF在有限数据情境下显著提高了材料设计任务的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DMA*-SH, a hypernetwork‑driven RL framework that adapts to latent actuator inversion contexts, proving both theoretically and experimentally that it generalizes robustly to unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero‑shot RL under latent binary contexts is hard, especially when identical actions lead to opposite effects (actuator inversion). Existing methods fail to capture such discontinuous dynamics.

Method: A shared hypernetwork generates adapter weights; dynamics prediction drives training; input/output normalization and random masking stabilize context inference; theoretical analyses of expressivity and variance bound support design.

Result: On the newly proposed Actuator Inversion Benchmark, DMA*-SH outperforms domain randomization by 111.8% and a context‑aware baseline by 16.1% for zero‑shot tasks.

Conclusion: DMA*-SH enables strong zero-shot generalization to unseen actuator inversion contexts by using a single hypernetwork to modulate dynamics, policy, and value functions, achieving robust performance without context labels.

Abstract: Zero-shot generalization in contextual reinforcement learning remains a core challenge, particularly when the context is latent and must be inferred from data. A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context. We propose DMA*-SH, a framework where a single hypernetwork, trained solely via dynamics prediction, generates a small set of adapter weights shared across the dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions. On AIB's held-out actuator-inversion tasks, DMA*-SH achieves zero-shot generalization, outperforming domain randomization by 111.8% and surpassing a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1%.

Abstract: Model merging constructs versatile models by integrating task-specific models without requiring labeled data or expensive joint retraining. Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components. To address these limitations, we propose MERGE (\underline{M}odular \underline{E}xpert \underline{R}ecombination for fine-\underline{G}rained m\underline{E}rging), a method that enables component-wise model merging and input-aware, on-demand module recombination at inference. MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints. Extensive experiments across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies demonstrate that MERGE consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes effectively.

TL;DR: 在线预算分配问题：获得 $Ω(T^{1/3})$ 下界；提出 RA‑UCB 和 MG‑UCB，分别在已知/未知预算下实现 $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret；实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多实际系统中，资源（如预算、能量等）需在线分配给多个任务，且每个任务成功的概率受未知参数影响，且奖励仍需超过随机阈值；传统多臂赌博机模型无法处理预算和阈值的双重不确定性。

Method: 采用信息理论与置信上界分析，先给出 regret 下界；随后设计基于贝叶斯自适应 UCB 的 RA‑UCB 算法；在预算未知的场景中引入可在回合内切换、无穷细分分配的 MG‑UCB 算法；通过证明两算法在估计未知参数时保持乐观性，得到相应的 regret 上界。

Result: 证明最小累计损失为 $Ω(T^{1/3})$；RA‑UCB 在预算已知时得到 $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt T)$ 的 regret，且在更强假设下可降低至 $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$；MG‑UCB 在预算未知时同样实现 $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt T)$ 的 regret。实验验证理论与算法在真实数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 文章提出并分析了在线资源分配问题的下界与上界，证明最优的 regret 曲线为 $Ω(T^{1/3})$，并提供了 RA‑UCB 与 MG‑UCB 两种算法，在已知预算时能实现 $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ 的 regret，甚至在更强假设下达到多项式对数阶；在未知预算时通过MG‑UCB实现相同的性能。

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

Motivation: 现有Diffusion Transformer在处理多维时间序列时未能充分利用各变量间的相关性，导致生成式预测性能受限。

Method: 将内生和外生变异量视为不同模态，采用双流Transformer块，包含Time Attention（自回归时序建模）与Variate Attention（跨变异量建模）。利用多元依赖低秩性质避免将二维token网格扁平化为一维序列，降低计算成本。

Conclusion: DiTS通过双流Transformer结构充分挖掘跨变异量和时间维度依赖，显著提升多元时间序列生成式预测的性能；在未来外生变异量可观测或不可观测情况下均表现出超越传统确定性深度预测模型的优势。

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

Method: 在网格世界导航任务和UVA/Padova临床糖尿病模拟器上测试离线强化学习算法，随后通过对时间重采样产生的锚点（计时间隔固定化）进行实验，识别并量化了对性能下降的三大机制：对因果轨迹的生成、时间预期的失真以及泛化误差的累积。

Result: 实验表明，时间重采样导致离线RL算法在现场部署时性能显著下降，三种机制均起作用。标准离线评估指标无法检测到性能滑坡，提示在医疗ORL系统中存在未被捕捉的风险。

Conclusion: 时间重采样显著降低了离线强化学习在医疗环境中的实时部署性能，标准离线评估指标难以检测此类性能下降，凸显了当前医疗ORL流程的根本风险，需要针对临床决策的非规则时序设计专门方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 传统监督学习追求预测准确性，易捕捉虚假相关；而因果结构学习可以提供稳健预测但过于保守，导致诊断精度降低。需要一种方法既保留预测性能，又保证因果稳健性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

Motivation: 过去的联邦学习攻击主要关注准确率下降或植入后门；置信度校准作为风险决策关键，却被忽视为潜在攻击目标。

Method: 温度缩放攻击（TSA）：在联邦学习的局部更新中嵌入温度缩放操作，并让学习率与温度同步变化，保证更新在训练期间表现出“正常”行为，从而规避准确率判定和相似度检测。

Result: 在CIFAR‑100等三大基准上，TSA使校准误差提升约145％，准确率仅变动不到2％；在医疗和自动驾驶案例中，误检/漏检率分别提升至原值的7.2倍。

Conclusion: 我们证明了在联邦学习中，通过在本地训练中注入温度缩放并与学习率耦合，可在不影响准确率的情况下显著破坏模型的置信度校准，形成一种新的攻击面。

Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

Abstract: Pruning at Initialisation methods discover sparse, trainable subnetworks before training, but their theoretical mechanisms remain elusive. Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features. Our results transform the study of sparse neural networks from combinatorial graph problems into a rigorous framework of continuous operators, offering a new mechanism for analysing expressivity and generalisation in sparse neural networks.

This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Conclusion: NanoQuant是首个实现LLM二进制和亚1位压缩的后训练量化方法，显著提升低内存场景性能；

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

Conclusion: 本研究表明，Transformer 的结构与优化设置能够显著影响 grokking 的速度和特性，强调整个训练过程中的特征演化及其对泛化的影响。

Abstract: We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at https://tinyurl.com/y52u3cad.

Motivation: 传统RLVR使用大群组估计优势，但受限于计算资源导致群组规模过小，易偏向已有优势轨迹，无法捕捉稀有正确路径。

Method: 通过分析群组大小与更新误差的关系，推导稀有正确模式被忽略的概率，并引入受Focal Loss启发的难度权重系数，抑制高成功提示的更新。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B上，使用该难度权重技术，GRPO、DAPO、CISPO的pass@256分别从64.1→70.3、69.3→72.5、73.2→76.8，且pass@1保持或提升，未增加组大小或计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在RLVR中使用可验证奖励时，群组大小对更新偏差的影响，并提出了以难度为自适应的优势缩放系数，显著提升了模型在多种基准上的通过率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种最大熵化的前向后向（forward‑backward）算法，可在零样本环境下直接优化任意可微泛化奖励函数，扩展了传统加性奖励的零样本强化学习方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

Conclusion: CTAD是一种模型无关的后处理框架，能显著提升任何现有表格异常检测器的性能，并在多样化数据集上保持一致的统计显著提升。

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

Motivation: GRPO等传统方法在所有提示与降噪步骤采用统一静态采样，未能充分利用样本学习价值差异与动态探索需求，导致效率低下。

Conclusion: 通过利用注意力熵的双重信号指导策略优化，AEGPO实现了更高效的资源分配和更精准的探索，显著提升了RLHF在文本到图像生成中的对齐性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.
  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.
  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.
  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants.

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional loss functions struggle with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, leading to reduced performance and slower convergence.

Method: Developed a robust, bounded, and smooth RoBoS-NN loss function; integrated it into a neural network for time series forecasting, yielding the L_RoBoS-NN algorithm.

Result: Experiments on real datasets with injected outliers demonstrate that L_RoBoS-NN outperforms benchmark models in accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed RoBoS-NN loss function improves robustness and generalization, achieving superior performance on challenging datasets.

Abstract: The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.

Result: 在华盛顿特区Capital Bikeshare数据上的实验表明，T-STAR在确定性和概率性精度上均优于现有方法，并在不同站点和时间段展示出强大的空间和时间鲁棒性。零样本预测实验进一步证明其能够在未训练过的服务区域无迁移学习即可直接使用。

Conclusion: T-STAR能够提供细粒度、可靠且兼顾不确定性的短期需求预测，为多模式行程规划和实时运营提供支持，提升共享微动交通工具的整体效能。

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

TL;DR: 提出DeVA框架，通过分解AdaGrad实现向量方差适应与矩阵光谱优化的结合，在多任务实验中显著优于现有自适应方法，改善收敛和资源利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应方法如Adam在向量优化中表现出色，但无法直接迁移至矩阵谱优化；需要一种能够桥接两者且易于实现的方法。

Method: 重新表述AdaGrad更新，将其分解为方差适应项与尺度不变项，形成DeVA框架，融合向量变异适应与矩阵光谱优化。

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，DeVA相较MuIn和SOAP等方法提高了约6.6%的 token 使用率，并理论上提升了块级光滑性从而加快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为DeVA的框架，将向量基变异适应与矩阵光谱优化结合，实现了从Adam到自适应光谱下降的平滑过渡，并在多项实验中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers. The code is available at https://github.com/ambroiseodt/vit-plasticity.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

Motivation: 传统的 OCO 只考虑静态或仅移动成本固定的情况，缺乏对时间变化移动成本的理论支持。

Method: 设计了一种新算法，利用运动成本系数变化而得到 \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t\lambda_t)})\) 的动态 regret 上界。

Result: 证明了在两种应用——延迟反馈和时变记忆——下，该算法同样能实现最优的比较器自适应动态 regret。

Conclusion: 该论文在无约束在线凸优化中引入可变化的移动成本，并提供首个比较器自适应动态 regret 上界。

Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

TL;DR: Aurora是一套将speculator学习与LLM推理无缝集成的系统，采用异步RL持续改进，提高了起始速度并对域漂移具有鲁棒性，实现了显著的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练显著延迟上线、难以实时获取加速收益、在域迁移时性能退化，亟需一体化的持续学习系统。

Method: 将在线speculator学习构建为异步强化学习框架，用已接受的token作为正反馈、被拒绝的proposal隐式负反馈；结合SGLang推理服务器与异步训练服务器，实现热插拔，无服务中断。

Result: 在MiniMax M2.1 229B、Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B等前沿模型上实现1.5倍日0加速；在Qwen3、Llama3等常用模型对分布变动迁移实现额外1.25倍加速。

Conclusion: Aurora通过持续学习让speculator实现即时部署并快速适应流量，显著提升LLM推理速度并降低适配延迟。

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在推理期间如何抵抗任务不匹配的激活引导，并系统分析这种自我调节机制的存在及其影响

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAE)潜变量对模型激活进行引导，并通过消融实验、元提示和微调来控制和强化ESR现象

Result: 在Llama-3.3‑70B中观察到显著的ESR，较小模型表现不明显；认定26个SAE潜变量与ESR相关；消融这些潜变量可将多次尝试率降低25%；元提示可将尝试率提升4倍；微调可在小模型中诱导ESR式行为

Conclusion: ESR既能防御对抗性操控，也可能干扰基于激活引导的安全干预；了解并控制ESR机制对构建透明可控AI系统至关重要

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.

Motivation: 多主体协同控制依赖通信拓扑，传统离线或基于启发式的在线设计方法难以兼顾连接效率、度平衡与求解速度。Quantum 的运算优势为在有限时间内可近似解大规模组合优化问题提供了新思路，研究旨在验证量子优化可否在闭环分布式控制中担当拓扑优化器。

Method: 在每一时刻，以混合整数二次程序（MIQP）形式精确建模通信图的选取，目标为最小化包含通信与距离惩罚、度正则化以及连通性流式约束的代价。为降低 NP‑hard 复杂性，提出三块 ADMM 算法：1）在松弛的边缘与流变量上求解凸二次子问题；2）将纯二进约束子问题转化为 QUBO Hamiltonian，并通过量子相对时间演化（QITE）近似求解；3）使用闭式解更新辅助变量。得到的时变拉普拉斯矩阵被直接应用于线性一阶与二阶一致性动力学。

Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum framework for the design of communication topologies in consensus-based multi-agent systems. The communication graph is selected online by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that minimizes a cost combining communication and distance penalties with degree-regularization terms, while enforcing exact connectivity through a flow-based formulation. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of this NP-hard problem, we develop a three-block ADMM scheme that decomposes the MIQP into a convex quadratic program in relaxed edge and flow variables, a pure binary unconstrained subproblem, and a closed-form auxiliary update. The binary subproblem is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonian and approximately solved via quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). The resulting time-varying, optimizer-generated Laplacians are applied to linear first- and second-order consensus dynamics. Numerical simulations on networks demonstrate that the proposed method produces connected topologies that satisfy degree constraints, achieve consensus, and incur costs comparable to those of classical mixed-integer solvers, thereby illustrating how quantum algorithms can be embedded as topology optimizers within closed-loop distributed control architectures.

Abstract: The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential.
  The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization. This review will identify potential synergies, research gaps, and emerging trends, paving the way for future innovations in BESS management and deployment strategies.

Abstract: This work develops a theoretical framework for safety controller synthesis in discrete-time stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems subject to time-invariant delays (dt-SNPS-td). While safety analysis of stochastic systems using control barrier certificates (CBC) has been widely studied, developing safety controllers for stochastic systems with time delays remains largely unexplored. The main challenge arises from the need to account for the influence of delayed components when formulating and enforcing safety conditions. To address this, we employ Krasovskii control barrier certificates, which extend the conventional CBC framework by augmenting it with an additional summation term that captures the influence of delayed states. This formulation integrates both the current and delayed components into a unified barrier structure, enabling safety synthesis for stochastic systems with time delays. The proposed approach synthesizes safety controllers under input constraints, offering probabilistic safety guarantees robust to such delays: it ensures that all trajectories of the dt-SNPS-td remain within the prescribed safe region while fulfilling a quantified probabilistic bound. To achieve this, our method reformulates the safety constraints as a sum-of-squares optimization program, enabling the systematic construction of Krasovskii CBC together with their associated safety controllers. We validate the proposed framework through three case studies, including two physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Result: 数据驱动模型在预测精度与数据效率上与MPEM持平，训练-评估时间约1 ms，且无需出现MPEM校准常见的病态工作空间。

Conclusion: 使用多层感知器保持线性电流依赖，能够得到与MPEM相当的预测精度，且可快速实现闭式最小范数逆并消除工作空间病态。

Abstract: Precise magnetic field modeling is fundamental to the closed-loop control of electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) and the analytical Multipole Expansion Model (MPEM) is the current standard. However, the MPEM relies on strict physical assumptions regarding source symmetry and isolation, and requires optimization-based calibration that is highly sensitive to initialization. These constraints limit its applicability to systems with complex or irregular coil geometries. This work introduces an alternative modeling paradigm based on multi-layer perceptrons that learns nonlinear magnetic mappings while strictly preserving the linear dependence on currents. As a result, the field models enable fast, closed-form minimum-norm inversion with evaluation times of approximately 1 ms, which is critical for high-bandwidth magnetic control. For model training and evaluation we use large-scale, high-density datasets collected from the research-grade OctoMag and clinical-grade Navion systems. Our results demonstrate that data-driven models achieve predictive fidelity equivalent to the MPEM while maintaining comparable data efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that straightforward design choices effectively eliminate spurious workspace ill-conditioning frequently reported in MPEM-based calibration. To facilitate future research, we release the complete codebase and datasets open source.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of data-driven optimal derivative feedback controllers for an active magnetic levitation system. A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.

Motivation: 在分布式机器学习与异构 IoT 设备环境下，如何在帮助者具有内存容量限制的前提下，让客户与帮助者的分配及帮助者的任务调度最小化整体训练时间，成为核心挑战。

Method: 首先通过复杂性理论证明即使在特殊限制情况下，该问题也无法在多项式时间内得到精确解或多项式时间近似；随后提出了一个非平凡的 5‑approximation 多项式时间算法；在异构任务设置下，证明在 P≠NP 的前提下不可能存在任何多项式时间近似方案，进而基于 5‑approx 算法构造了新的启发式方法，并在实验中与先前工作进行比较。

Conclusion: 拆分学习的客户端-帮助者分配与任务调度问题在同质与异质两种情形下均表现出高度的计算复杂性；虽然在同质情形下可提供可接受的 5‑近似方案，但在异质情形下只能退化为启发式解决方案。

Abstract: Split learning recently emerged as a solution for distributed machine learning with heterogeneous IoT devices, where clients can offload part of their training to computationally-powerful helpers. The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments.

Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, the large-scale RIS introduces pronounced geometric effects that lead to the coexistence of far-field and near-field propagation. Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches.

TL;DR: Xona’s Pulsar LEO system and new SSP algorithms enable reliable meter‑accurate positioning for small IoT devices using just one or two satellites, validated by simulation and real‑orbit tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNSS struggles in urban canyons, semi‑indoor, and constrained environments; IoT platforms demand high availability over sub‑meter precision without complex hardware.

Method: Developed SSP algorithms that combine Pulsar signal strength and LEO dynamics to estimate user position and clock states without external aiding, validated through high‑fidelity constellation simulations and real‑orbit observations (Pulsar‑0).

Result: Simulation and live sky tests show that SSP with Pulsar achieves meter‑level accuracy outdoors and indoors, demonstrating viability with minimal satellite visibility.

Conclusion: Pulsar LEO navigation enables single-satellite positioning (SSP) achieving meter‑level accuracy even with one or two satellites, suitable for IoT devices with strict SWaP constraints.

Abstract: Xona is deploying Pulsar, a low Earth orbit (LEO) commercial navigation system designed to deliver resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) where traditional solutions fall short. Pulsar satellites broadcast dedicated signals optimized for commercial users. This brings rapid geometry change, strong Doppler observability, and robust timing, enabling new approaches to positioning even when only one satellite is visible. Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware.
  Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit. Preliminary tests demonstrate meter-level accuracy outdoors and indoors, highlighting potential under varied reception conditions.

Conclusion: 利用低地球轨道卫星发射的 Ku 频段信号实现了位置、速度、时间 (PVT) 估算，后处理后定位误差仅约 268 m。

Abstract: The computation of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) via signal of opportunity (SOP), where signals originally transmitted for communication, such as 5G, Wi-Fi, or DVB-S, are exploited due to their ubiquity and spectral characteristics, is an emerging research field. However, relying on these signals presents challenges, including limited knowledge of the signal modulation and the need to identify recurring sequences for correlation. We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-enabled radar and communication coexistence (RCC) system, detailing the key aspects of its phase synthesis codebook generation and the implemented localization algorithm for real-time user tracking based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which features a Kalman filter for the prediction of user mobility. We derived a 3GPP-compatible radar cross-section (RCS) and re-radiation pattern-based channel model for the described MF-RIS system, supplementing it with channel measurements. We obtained large and small-scale characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, cluster powers, and RMS delay spread. The study finds that Sub-6 GHz indoor propagation is largely free of blind spots, even with a blocked line-of-sight (LoS) path. Therefore, the proposed channel model includes non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, including the ones created by the MF-RIS. We also performed an experimental evaluation of the channel throughput in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) single user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) system, reporting a 74\% reduction in throughput variance and a 12.5\% sum-rate improvement within the MF-RIS near-field compared to the no-RIS setup. This result shows that the MF-RIS can minimize delay spread and increase the coherence bandwidth by creating virtual-LoS (vLoS) path for the moving user, thereby effectively hardening wireless MIMO channels.

Result: 证明含 L/2+1 频调纹波形足以使 Wiener 滤波器无效，并在仿真中验证提升的均方误差。

Conclusion: 对 Wiener 预测滤波器的抗干扰模块在面临特定多波段干扰信号时可能完全失效。

Abstract: In the context of civilian and military communications, anti-jamming techniques are essential to ensure information integrity in the presence of malicious interference. A conventional time-domain approach relies on computing the Wiener interpolation filter to estimate and suppress the jamming waveform from the received samples. It is widely acknowledged that this method is effective for protecting wideband systems against narrowband interference. In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal.

Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.

Abstract: Consider multiple users and a fusion center. Each user possesses a sequence of bits and can communicate with the fusion center through a one-way public channel. The fusion center's task is to compute the sum of all the sequences under the privacy requirement that a set of colluding users, along with the fusion center, cannot gain more than a predetermined amount $δ$ of information, measured through mutual information, about the sequences of other users. Our first contribution is to characterize the minimum amount of necessary communication between the users and the fusion center, as well as the minimum amount of necessary randomness at the users. Our second contribution is to establish a connection between private sum computation and secret sharing by showing that secret sharing is necessary to generate the local randomness needed for private sum computation, and prove that it holds true for any $δ\geq 0$.

Abstract: This paper characterizes the fundamental limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) when the transmitter is subject to an artificial intelligence (AI) representation bottleneck and the receiver employs a fluid antenna system (FAS). Specifically, the message is first encoded into an ideal Gaussian waveform and mapped by an AI encoder into a finite-capacity latent representation that constitutes the physical channel input, while the FAS receiver selects the port experiencing the most favorable channel conditions. We reveal that the AI bottleneck is equivalent to an additive representation noise, which reduces both the communication and sensing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the selected port. We then derive the resulting ISAC capacitydistortion region and establish tight converse and achievability bounds under general fading models, including Jakes-correlated channels. Leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of the Jakes' model, we furthermore prove that the port-selection gain is fundamentally constrained by the physical length of the FAS region: the effective diversity order equals the numerical rank of the Jakes' correlation matrix and increases only with the FAS length. Consequently, enlarging the FAS length allows the selected-port SNR to approach the AI-imposed ceiling, driving the achievable communication rate and sensing mean square error (MSE) toward their AI-limited fundamental bounds. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and scaling laws.

### [134] [Hermitian Self-dual Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06377)
*Chun'e Zhao,Wenping Ma*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper fully solves the existence and construction problem for Hermitian self‑dual GRS codes: it shows that only two families exist for n≤q+1 and provides explicit construction methods for each.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hermitian self‑dual GRS codes are useful for coding theory and related cryptographic constructions, but unlike Euclidean self‑dual GRS codes, their existence has been far more limited and largely conjectural, especially for lengths exceeding q+1. Addressing this gap and providing a full characterization would advance both theory and practical applications.

Method: The authors first prove structural constraints on Hermitian self‑dual GRS codes with n≤q+1, showing that only two parameter classes satisfy the duality conditions; then they give two construction procedures (explicit algebraic settings of evaluation points and multiplier vectors) that produce all codes in these classes.

Result: The main results are: (1) proof that for any finite field of size q, Hermitian self‑dual GRS codes of length n only exist when n≤q+1 and belong to exactly two distinct families; (2) explicit construction formulas for both families, giving a constructive proof of existence for all admissible parameters; (3) confirmation of the conjecture in [13].

Conclusion: The paper establishes that for lengths n≤q+1 there are only two types of Hermitian self‑dual generalized Reed–Solomon (GRS) codes, proving a previously conjectured fact, and provides complete explicit constructions for all such codes.

Abstract: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) self-dual codes are of significant theoretical and practical importance. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Correspondingly there have been many research on constructions of Euclidean self-dual MDS codes by using GRS codes. However, the study on Hermitian self-dual GRS codes is relatively limited. Since Hermitian self-dual GRS codes do not exist for $n>q+1$, this paper is devoted to an investigation of GRS codes in the case where $n\le q+1$. First, we prove that when $n\leq q+1$, there are only two classes of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes, confirming the conjecture in [13] and providing its proof simultaneously. Second, we present two explicit construction methods. Thus, the existence and construction of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes are fully solved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the joint compression problem of a vector Gaussian source, where an individual distortion constraint is imposed on each source component. It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental task of addition under uncertainty, namely, addends that are represented as intervals of numbers rather than single values. One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under finite-length training with Gaussian pilots. The user employs minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by asymptotically optimal uplink feedback. Specifically, we derive a general rate-distortion function (RDF) of the overall CSI feedback system. We then provide both non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic scaling for the RDF under arbitrary downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of training symbols exceeds the antenna dimension. A key observation is that, with sufficient training, the overall RDF converges to the direct RDF corresponding to the case where the user has full access to the downlink CSI. More importantly, we demonstrate that even at a fixed downlink SNR, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the training length. The simulation results show that our bounds are tight, and under very limited training, the deviation between the overall RDF and the direct RDF is substantial.

Abstract: Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.
