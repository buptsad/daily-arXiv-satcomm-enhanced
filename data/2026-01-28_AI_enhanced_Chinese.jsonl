The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods.

Code repository: https://github.com/researchaudio/canarybench", "summary": "Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.\n  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings (\"canaries\") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.\n  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy.

To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPBC\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4ea7\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9759\u6001\u4e8c\u7ef4/\u4e09\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6790\u8005\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5fc5\u8fde/\u975e\u8fde\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u6539\u8fdb\u6295\u5f71\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u56de\u539f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b65\u9aa4\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89c4\u5219\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "IPBC\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\u3002"}}

While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization.

However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space.

Camera ready copy forthcoming", "summary": "Prompt-based attack techniques are one of the primary challenges in securely deploying and protecting LLM-based AI systems. LLM inputs are an unbounded, unstructured space. Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them.", "AI": {"tldr": "HASTE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96be\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u57fa\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5e76\u5728\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u786c\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "Prompt-based attacks\u5bf9LLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u6784\u6210\u4e3b\u8981\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u7531\u4e8eLLM\u8f93\u5165\u6ca1\u6709\u754c\u9650\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0d\u826f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u786c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHASTE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u4f55\u786c\u8d1f\u6216\u786c\u6b63\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408fuzzing\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u786c\u8d1f\u6316\u6398\u5c06\u6076\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea664%\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cHASTE\u80fd\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HASTE\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u786c\u5316\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u52a8\u6001\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\u5f31\u70b9\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\uff1b\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u80fd\u8fc5\u901f\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u3002"}}

This study proposes a multi-material/thickness individualized transtibial prosthetic socket that focuses on providing comfort. This study aims to identify the proper material and thickness to protect Calf areas and reduce the pressure around bone areas. First, the socket is divided into four parts depending on the pressure-sensitive/tolerant regions. After identifying the thickness range for each concerned area, the thickness and material are selected based on the Pressure-Pain Threshold (PPT) test, and the finalized design is then prototyped. The prototyped individualized socket (i-Socket) is 22% lighter than the participant's own socket.

This approach emphasizes open interfaces for telemetry sharing, intelligent data-driven control loops for network optimization, and virtualization and disaggregation of multi-vendor RAN components. While promising, this transition introduces significant challenges, including the need to design interoperable solutions, acquire datasets to train and test AI/ML algorithms for inference and control, and develop testbeds to benchmark these solutions. Experimental wireless platforms and private 5G deployments play a key role, providing architectures comparable to real-world systems and enabling prototyping and testing in realistic environments. This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of complementary experimental platforms: Colosseum, the world's largest Open RAN digital twin, and X5G, an open, programmable, multi-vendor private 5G O-RAN testbed with GPU acceleration. The main contributions include: (i) CaST, enabling automated creation and validation of digital twin wireless scenarios through 3D modeling, ray-tracing, and channel sounding; (ii) validation of Colosseum digital twins at scale, demonstrating that emulated environments closely reproduce real-world setups; (iii) X5G, integrating NVIDIA Aerial GPU-accelerated PHY processing with OpenAirInterface higher layers; (iv) a GPU-accelerated dApp framework for real-time RAN inference, enabling sub-millisecond control loops for AI-native applications including ISAC; and (v) intelligent RAN applications spanning spectrum sharing, interference detection, network slicing, security, and CSI-based sensing.

Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset.

Some mitigation strategies against these attacks do exist, but they are not as far-reaching or as efficient as the CHERI architecture. CHERI uses capabilities to restrict pointers to certain regions of memory and with certain access restrictions. These capabilities are also used to implement \"compartmentalisation\": dividing a binary into smaller components with limited privilege, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. However, while this architecture successfully mitigates memory corruption attacks, the compartmentalisation mechanisms in place are less effective in containing malicious code to a separate compartment. This paper details four ways to bypass compartmentalisation, with a focus on Linux and BSD operating systems ported to this architecture. We find that although compartmentalisation is implemented in these two operating systems, simple bugs and attacks can still allow malicious code to bypass it.

Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware status updates in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, where each vehicle's status is represented by multiple interdependent packets. To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE).

The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u5e76\u7528PSO\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u3001\u9891\u5e26\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u5f80\u5f80\u670d\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u7f8eCSI\u6216\u7406\u60f3\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6389\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9ad8\u9891\u65e0\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0b\u884c\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6389\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations.

A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting.

Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \\textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528 BLE \u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0e WiFi \u7684\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u540c\u6b65\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u80f6\u56ca\u5185\u955c\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u80f6\u56ca\u5185\u955c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5e27\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u75c5\u53d8\u6f0f\u68c0\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e27\u7387\u65b9\u6848\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff1b\u9ad8\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8870\u51cf\u9650\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u529f\u8017\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u4eff\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u6d4b\u91cf BLE \u4e0e 2.4\u202fGHz WiFi \u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001RSSI \u4e0e\u529f\u8017\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u653e\u5927 BLE \u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\uff1b3) \u4ee5 2.4\u202fGHz WiFi \u7ad9\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\uff1b4) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e27\u8fb9\u754c\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd BLE \u4e0e WiFi \u5207\u6362\u671f\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "result": "- \u653e\u5927 BLE \u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\uff1b- 2.4\u202fGHz WiFi \u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927 10 \u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002- hybrid \u7cfb\u7edf\u5207\u6362\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1aBLE\u2192WiFi 92.66\u202fms\uff0cWiFi\u2192BLE 15.49\u202fms\uff1b\u652f\u6301 10\u202fkB \u56fe\u50cf\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 BLE+WiFi \u6df7\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u4f53\u7cfb\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528 WiFi \u7684\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3 WCE \u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u7ebf\u80f6\u56ca\u5185\u955c\u5e73\u53f0\u5960\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We focus on a network where single-antenna sensors transmit spatially correlated measurements to a multiple-antenna collector node (CN) via non-orthogonal multiple access. We propose an estimation scheme based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728MTC\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165RIS\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408MMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0eSIC\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4f4eMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316RIS\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86FBL\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eCSI\u8bef\u5dee\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u901a\u4fe1\uff08MTC\uff09\u4e2d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u7126\u5355\u5929\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u5740\u5411\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u6536\u96c6\u5668\uff08CN\uff09\u4f20\u8f93\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bf4\u660eRIS\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MMSE\uff09\u51c6\u5219\u63d0\u51fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u4fa7\u5f15\u5165\u6210\u529f\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\uff08SIC\uff09\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4eceRIS\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0eSIC\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\uff08FBL\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u53d6CSI\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aRIS\u9762\u79ef\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MSE\uff09\u8d8a\u4f4e\uff1b\u4e14\u5408\u9002\u7684SIC\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528RIS\u4e0eSIC\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u77ed\u5305\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u5907\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u9650\u7684\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u914d\u7f6eRIS\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process.

In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design.

However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, accurately assessing the impact of EM exposure for proper design strategies remains challenging. In this paper, we develop a long-term thermal EM exposure constraint model and propose a novel adaptive exposure-aware beamforming design for an mmWave uplink system. Specifically, we first establish an equivalent channel model based on Maxwell's radiation equations, which accurately captures the EM physical effects. Then, we derive a closed-form thermal impulse response model from the Pennes bioheat transfer equation (BHTE), characterizing the thermal inertia of tissue. Inspired by this model, we formulate a beamforming optimization problem that translates rigid instantaneous exposure limits into a flexible long-term thermal budget constraint. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online beamforming algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization theory, obtaining a closed-form near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively stabilizes tissue temperature near a predefined safety threshold and significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with instantaneous exposure constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees.

The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy.

MEV Attacks in Private L2 Mempools", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the feasibility, profitability, and prevalence of sandwich attacks on Ethereum rollups with private mempools. First, we extend a formal model of optimal front- and back-run sizing, relating attack profitability to victim trade volume, liquidity depth, and slippage bounds. We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity.

We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks.

Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice.

We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation.

The evolution of these frameworks culminates in eIDAS 2.0, whose origins trace back to the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC, the first EU-wide legal foundation for the use of electronic signatures in cross-border electronic transactions. As technological capabilities advanced, the initial eIDAS 1.0 framework was increasingly criticized for its limitations and lack of comprehensiveness. Emerging decentralized approaches further exposed these shortcomings and introduced the possibility of integrating innovative identity paradigms, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models.\n  In this article, we analyse key provisions of the eIDAS 2.0 Regulation and its accompanying recitals, drawing on existing literature to identify legislative gaps and implementation challenges.

Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \\emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6839\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5851\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0Nadir COI\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u533a\u95f4\u632f\u8361\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u548c\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u60ef\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u9891\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5f31\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651COI\u9891\u7387\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u632f\u8361", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u632f\u8361\u963b\u5c3c\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96f6\u70b9\u6446\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6839\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f", "result": "\u7ed9\u51faFS\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u963b\u5c3c\u6bd4\u4e0e\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u6613\u8c03\u8282\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1FS\u4f18\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u60ef\u91cf\u63a7\u5236", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6839\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684FS\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u9891\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u632f\u8361\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f31\u7f51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0Nadir COI\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfVI\u63a7\u5236"}}

By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees.

However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528DFT-s-OFDM\u8f6cDD\u57df\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u8054\u5408\u7b49\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u57285G NR\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u548cMSE\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7b26\u53f7\u65e0\u8f7d\u6ce2\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u57285G NR\u4ecd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76846G\u7814\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u8f6c\u5411DDMC\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709OFDM/DFT-s-OFDM\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DFT-s-OFDM\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2aOFDM\u7b26\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\u81f3DD\u57df\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u901a\u9053\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u9010\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u9053\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7b49\u5316\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u57df\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u548cNMSE\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u53ea\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u5e27SRS\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc725\u4e2aOFDM\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u65e0\u8f7d\u6ce2\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u73b0\u67095G NR DFT-s-OFDM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\uff08DD\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u7b49\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u8f7d\u6ce2\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DD\u57df\u5904\u7406\u57286G\u9884\u671f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems.

Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains.

While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations.

We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence.

Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control", "comment": "28 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead.

However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment.

We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters).

Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u5c0f\u7684\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7a84\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51faUE5M3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u826f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528 FP8 \u65e0\u7b26\u53f7 E5M3\uff08UE5M3\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a FP4 \u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf FP8 \u65e0\u7b26\u53f7 E4M3 \u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u964d\u81f3\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7a84\u5ced\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.\n  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution.

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion.

Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback.

Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss \"winner,\" a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min).

This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end.

In this work, we present \\emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks.

By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization.

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data.

A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.\n  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.\n  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.\n  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU.

Recently, Nguyen et al.

Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\\sqrt\u03b2t}) for $\u03b2$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting.

Source code available at https://github.com/darkflash03/SOLD Accepted to AAAI 2026", "summary": "RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "SOLD\u7ed3\u5408RL\u548clatent diffusion\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u566a\u58f0\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u6062\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6700\u4f4e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u7b49\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0elatent diffusion\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684SOLD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RNA\u2011FM\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0cSOLD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLDM\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SOLD\u5728RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u9879\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\uff08SS\u3001MFE\u3001LDDT\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLDM\u53ca\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RL\u4e0elatent diffusion\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment.

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results.

However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.\n  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline.

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$.

However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \\emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \\emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.\n  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\\cdot k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity.

From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\\% capability retention on standard benchmarks.

In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\\% and surpassing all baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDSP-Reg\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u805a\u7126\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u53c2\u6570\u5c42\u9762\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u57df\u53d8\u6362\u654f\u611f\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53c2\u6570", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8f6f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5DSP-Reg", "result": "\u5728PACS\u3001VLCS\u3001OfficeHome\u3001DomainNet\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe66.7%\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf", "conclusion": "DSP-Reg\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u57df\u654f\u611f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA).

Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications.

We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias.

Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework.

We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying \"uniformity\" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening.

Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MEA \u5229\u7528 HLC \u4e0e GroupNorm \u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u591a\u5934\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer \u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u591a\u5934\u4ea4\u4e92\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u5934\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "MEA\u7531\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u6210\uff1aHead-level Linear Composition\uff08HLC\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5934\u7684 key/value \u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u52a0\u5165\u5934\u7ea7 Group Normalization \u5bf9\u91cd\u7ec4\u540e\u7684\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "MEA \u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d KV-cache \u538b\u7f29\u8fbe 50% \u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u635f\u5931 3.59% \u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5934\u663e\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MEA\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u5934\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c14\u5019\u805a\u7c7b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u65b0\u5efa\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\u6c14\u5019\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u6839\u636e\u6c14\u8c61\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5c06\u529f\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u65b0\u573a\u7ad9\u6839\u636e\u5176\u6c14\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee(MAE)\u4e3a3.52%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4e0d\u52305\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u65b0\u5efa\u6d77\u4e0a\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u529f\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u4e00\u5e74\u89c2\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\\%$\\uparrow$.

In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations.

This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?\n  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures.

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u591a\u5411\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u51b3\u7b56\u9762\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5f02\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5df2\u6709\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6781\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff08OOD\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6570\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cmeta-tuning\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684softmax\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fb9\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51b3\u7b56\u9762\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u6781\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684episode\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u5411\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5411\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u533a\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5411\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6b63\u5e38+\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size.

Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDFT\u662f\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65e7\u6280\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9700\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\uff1bSDFT\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u6f14\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u8eab\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u7b56\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u65e0\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSDFT\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4SFT\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7d2f\u8ba1\u591a\u9879\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SDFT\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5df2\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}
