Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $τ$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/κ)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/δ)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $κ>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical methods. Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite. Our approach achieves strong performance on parameter sets held out from the training distribution, with strong stability for rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to an entirely unseen PDE. This work was developed as part of a broader effort exploring AI systems that automate the creation of expert-level empirical software for scorable scientific tasks. The data and codebase are available at https://github.com/google-research/generalized-pde-emulator.

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $η$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $η_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $η_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $η$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $η/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-δ$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($δ\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $γ$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/γ))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/γ)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

Abstract: Improving competent robot policies with on-policy RL is often hampered by noisy, low-signal gradients. We revisit Evolution Strategies (ES) as a policy-gradient proxy and localize exploration with bounded, antithetic triangular perturbations, suitable for policy refinement. We propose Triangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES) which pairs bounded triangular noise with a centered-rank finite-difference estimator to deliver stable, parallelizable, gradient-free updates. In a two-stage pipeline -- PPO pretraining followed by TD-ES refinement -- this preserves early sample efficiency while enabling robust late-stage gains. Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(Δ_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through Lévy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Abstract: Reliable, generalizable data foundations are critical for enabling large-scale models in computational lithography.

Trained on a large-scale industrial lithography simulation dataset with hundreds of thousands of cases, Unitho supports end-to-end mask generation, lithography simulation, and rule violation detection. By enabling agile and high-fidelity lithography simulation, Unitho further facilitates the construction of robust data foundations for intelligent EDA. Experimental results validate its effectiveness and generalizability, with performance substantially surpassing academic baselines.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $Ω(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-η}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - Ω(η)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. This work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of hyperparameter tuning and the underlying mechanics of deep learning.

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruxideng/Panda .

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables multi-gigabit-per-second data rates but is highly susceptible to path loss and blockage, especially indoors. Many indoor settings, however, include naturally occurring specular surfaces such as glass, glossy metal panels, and signage, that reflect both light and mmWave signals. Exploiting this dual reflectivity, we propose See and Beam, a low-cost framework that combines LiDAR sensing with passive specular reflectors to enhance mmWave connectivity under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this paper, as a proof of concept, we deploy three types of reflectors, glossy, smooth, and matte (non-specular), to evaluate joint LiDAR/mmWave reflection in an indoor scenario. We demonstrate that using LiDAR-mmWave co-reflective surfaces enables a co-located LiDAR sensor to map the NLoS environment, localize NLoS users, and identify viable communication reflection points. Experimental results at 60 GHz show that LiDAR-guided beam steering with co-reflective surfaces improves the minimum received signal strength by over 20 dB in deep NLoS regions. Moreover, LiDAR-derived angle-of-departure steering achieves performance comparable to exhaustive NLoS beam search. This low cost, and scalable framework serves as an effective alternative to configurable reflecting surfaces and enables robust mmWave connectivity in future 6G and beyond networks.

Abstract: Due to its static protocol design, IEEE 802.11 (aka Wi-Fi) channel access lacks adaptability to address dynamic network conditions, resulting in inefficient spectrum utilization, unnecessary contention, and packet collisions. This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to optimize Wi-Fi's medium access control (MAC). In particular, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for dynamic channel access (including both the primary channel and channel width) and contention window (CW) adjustment. In this setting, we study relevant learning design principles such as adopting joint or factorial action spaces (handled by a single agent (SA) and multiple agents (MA), respectively) and the importance of incorporating contextual information. Our simulation results show that cooperative MA architectures converge faster than their SA counterparts, as agents operate over smaller action spaces. Another key insight is that contextual MAB algorithms consistently outperform non-contextual ones, highlighting the value of leveraging side information in action selection. Moreover, in multi-player settings, results demonstrate that decentralized learners can achieve implicit coordination, although their greediness may degrade coexisting networks' performance and induce policy-chasing dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (contextual) MAB-based learning offers a practical and adaptive alternative to static IEEE 802.11 protocols, enabling more efficient and intelligent spectrum utilization.

Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of IEEE standards that extends Ethernet with real-time capabilities. Among its mechanisms, TSN can coordinate transmission times network-wide to minimize queueing, ensuring low latency and bounded delay. This coordination is computed offline and yields a network-wide schedule. The Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), implemented in TSN bridges, protects high-priority scheduled traffic from lower-priority (best-effort) flows by periodically opening and closing priority queues according to this schedule. Deterministic Networking (DetNet), standardized by the IETF, provides similar guarantees at Layer 3 and can leverage TSN mechanisms such as TAS for that purpose. Commercially available TSN-capable switches typically implement TAS in hardware but rarely disclose internal processing delays such as queue opening latency. Such information is essential for precise scheduling but largely unavailable to system designers. In this work, we present P4-TAS, a P4-based implementation of the TAS on a hardware switching ASIC. Our design introduces a novel approach for periodic queue control using a continuous stream of internally generated TAS control frames. We identify and quantify three sources of internal delay on a nanosecond scale which also exist in other implementations that directly affect the precision of executed schedules, providing transparency for future implementations and scheduling algorithms. Moreover, we provide an MPLS/TSN translation layer that enables P4-TAS to operate within DetNet environments, allowing TSN time-based traffic shaping to be carried over high-speed 400 Gb/s forwarding. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of P4-TAS and compare it to available TAS implementations.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) offer genuine simplicity for communication network design by eliminating expensive hardware overhead and reducing the complexity of access protocol architectures. Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures. The proposed BLER bound is computable both with and without an explicit statistical model, meaning that the BLER performance can be characterized analytically or empirically under model-aware or model-free system scenarios. Moreover, when the statistical model is known, the analytical results derived from the proposed BLER bound exhibit strong alignment with the empirical findings, demonstrating the remarkable simplicity, accuracy, and universality of the proposed BLER bound.

Abstract: Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on the transportation and delivery of the \emph{meaning} of messages. Recent results have verified that a graphical structure provides the most expressive and structurally faithful formalism for representing the relational semantics in most information sources. However, most existing works represent the semantics based on pairwise relation-based graphs, which cannot capture the higher-order interactions that are essential for some semantic sources. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian hypergraph inference-based semantic communication framework that can directly recover implicit semantic information involving high-order hyperedges at the receiver based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics sent by the transmitter. Experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed SBRF achieves up to 90\% recovery accuracy of the high-order hyperedges based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics.

Abstract: Semenov and Trifonov [22] developed a spectral theory for quasi-cyclic codes and formulated a BCH-like minimum distance bound. Their approach was generalized by Zeh and Ling [24], by using the HT bound. The first spectral bound for quasi-twisted codes appeared in [7], which generalizes Semenov-Trifonov and Zeh-Ling bounds, but its overall performance was observed to be worse than the Jensen bound. More recently, an improved spectral bound for quasi-cyclic codes was proposed in [15], which outperforms the Jensen bound in many cases. In this paper, we adopt this approach to quasi-twisted case and we show that this new generalized spectral bound provides tighter lower bounds on the minimum distance compared to the Jensen and Ezerman et. al. bounds.

Given the hypothesis, each observation is generated according to a distribution chosen (from the set associated with the hypothesis) by an adversary who has access to past observations. In the sequential setting, the number of observations the detector uses to arrive at a decision is variable; this extra freedom improves the asymptotic performance of the test. We characterize the closure of the set of achievable pairs of error exponents. We also study the problem under constraints on the number of observations used and the probability of error incurred.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.

Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.

Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dimensionality reduction and pooling methods for Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) using lightweight CNNs. We evaluate Sparse Salient Region Pooling (SSRP) and its variants, SSRP-Basic (SSRP-B) and SSRP-Top-K (SSRP-T), under various hyperparameter settings and compare them with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments on the ESC-50 dataset demonstrate that SSRP-T achieves up to 80.69 % accuracy, significantly outperforming both the baseline CNN (66.75 %) and the PCA-reduced model (37.60 %). Our findings confirm that a well-tuned sparse pooling strategy provides a robust, efficient, and high-performing solution for ESC tasks, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios where balancing accuracy and computational cost is crucial.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems face the challenge of high channel acquisition overhead while providing significant spectral efficiency (SE). Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods. An open-source Python/PyTorch implementation with full datasets is provided to facilitate reproducible and extensible research in cell-free ISAC.

Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) introduces a new spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting orientations without the need of changing its elements' positions in real time. To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups.

Abstract: Global placement is a critical step with high computational complexity in VLSI physical design. Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.

Abstract: This paper analyzes a NOMA-enabled dual-Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) relay network integrated with Ambient Backscatter (BS) communication. The system comprises a source, an energy-constrained relay with energy harvesting (EH) and BS capabilities, two NOMA users, and a BS node. The relay adopts a time-switching relaying (TSR) protocol to harvest energy and forward information ,while simultaneously enabling BS-based communication. Two IRS are deployed to enhance the S to R and R to (D1, D2) links under blockage conditions. Closed-form expressions for the Outage Probability (OP) and Throughput of both the main communication links and the BS-assisted secondary links are derived. Furthermore, throughput is analyzed under varying system parameters, including power allocation factors, reflection efficiency, IRS elements, and transmission rate. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results. numerical findings reveal critical trade-offs between the main and RS links. The proposed framework provides useful insights for designing reliable and energy-efficient NOMA-IRS-aided BS networks for future IoT applications.

Abstract: Traditional joint source-channel coding employs static learned semantic representations that cannot dynamically adapt to evolving source distributions. Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of bandwidth.To address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval
  mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline.

Abstract: Radio-based localization systems conventionally require stationary reference points (e.g. anchors) with precisely surveyed positions, making deployment time-consuming and costly. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of collaborative self-calibration for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) networks, extending a discrete Bayesian approach based on grid-based uncertainty propagation. The enhanced algorithm reduces measurement availability requirements while maintaining positioning accuracy through probabilistic state estimation. We validate the approach using real-world data from controlled indoor UWB network experiments with 12 nodes in a static environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 0.28~m mean ranging error under line-of-sight conditions and 1.11~m overall ranging error across mixed propagation scenarios, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy. Results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to measurement noise and partial connectivity scenarios typical in industrial deployments. The findings contribute to automated UWB network initialization for indoor positioning applications, reducing infrastructure dependency compared to manual anchor calibration procedures.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in modern cybersecurity frameworks by providing a primary defense mechanism against sophisticated threat actors. In this paper, we propose an explainable intrusion detection framework that integrates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest (RF) to enhance detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). By using CICIDS2017 dataset, the approach begins with comprehensive data preprocessing and narrows down the most significant features via RFE. A Random Forest (RF) model was trained on the refined feature set, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) used to interpret the contribution of each selected feature. Our experiment demonstrates that the explainable RF-RFE achieved a detection accuracy of 99.9%, reducing false positive and computational cost in comparison to traditional classifiers. The findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating explainable AI and feature selection to develop a robust, transparent, and deployable IDS solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising phishing detection mechanism, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based detectors, including poor generalization to previously unseen websites and a lack of interpretability. However, LLMs' effectiveness for phishing detection remains unexplored. This study investigates how to effectively leverage LLMs for phishing detection (including target brand identification) by examining the impact of input modalities (screenshots, logos, HTML, and URLs), temperature settings, and prompt engineering strategies. Using a dataset of 19,131 real-world phishing websites and 243 benign sites, we evaluate seven LLMs -- two commercial models (GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.0 flash) and five open-source models (Qwen, Llama, Janus, DeepSeek-VL2, and R1) -- alongside two deep learning (DL)-based baselines (PhishIntention and Phishpedia).
  Our findings reveal that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models in phishing detection, while DL models demonstrate better performance on benign samples. For brand identification, screenshot inputs achieve optimal results, with commercial LLMs reaching 93-95% accuracy and open-source models, particularly Qwen, achieving up to 92%. However, incorporating multiple input modalities simultaneously or applying one-shot prompts does not consistently enhance performance and may degrade results. Furthermore, higher temperature values reduce performance. Based on these results, we recommend using screenshot inputs with zero temperature to maximize accuracy for LLM-based detectors with HTML serving as auxiliary context when screenshot information is insufficient.

Abstract: The increasing virtualization of fifth generation (5G) networks expands the attack surface of the user plane, making spoofing a persistent threat to slice integrity and service reliability. This study presents a slice-aware lightweight machine-learning framework for detecting spoofing attacks within 5G network slices. The framework was implemented on a reproducible Open5GS and srsRAN testbed emulating three service classes such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) under controlled benign and adversarial traffic. Two efficient classifiers, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained independently for each slice using statistical flow features derived from mirrored user-plane traffic. Slice-aware training improved detection accuracy by up to 5% and achieved F1-scores between 0.93 and 0.96 while maintaining real-time operation on commodity edge hardware. The results demonstrate that aligning security intelligence with slice boundaries enhances detection reliability and preserves operational isolation, enabling practical deployment in 5G network-security environments. Conceptually, the work bridges network-security architecture and adaptive machine learning by showing that isolation-aware intelligence can achieve scalable, privacy-preserving spoofing defense without high computational cost.

Abstract: The rapid growth of smart devices such as phones, wearables, IoT sensors, and connected vehicles has led to an explosion of continuous time series data that offers valuable insights in healthcare, transportation, and more. However, this surge raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive patterns can reveal personal details. While traditional differential privacy (DP) relies on trusted servers, local differential privacy (LDP) enables users to perturb their own data. However, traditional LDP methods perturb time series data by adding user-specific noise but exhibit vulnerabilities. For instance, noise applied within fixed time windows can be canceled during aggregation (e.g., averaging), enabling adversaries to infer individual statistics over time, thereby eroding privacy guarantees.
  To address these issues, we introduce a Cooperative Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) mechanism that enhances privacy by distributing noise vectors across multiple users. In our approach, noise is collaboratively generated and assigned so that when all users' perturbed data is aggregated, the noise cancels out preserving overall statistical properties while protecting individual privacy. This cooperative strategy not only counters vulnerabilities inherent in time-window-based methods but also scales effectively for large, real-time datasets, striking a better balance between data utility and privacy in multiuser environments.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) compresses large datasets into smaller ones while preserving the performance of models trained on them. Although DD is often assumed to enhance data privacy by aggregating over individual examples, recent studies reveal that standard DD can still leak sensitive information from the original dataset due to the lack of formal privacy guarantees. Existing differentially private (DP)-DD methods attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting noise into the distillation process. However, they often fail to fully leverage the original dataset, resulting in degraded realism and utility. This paper introduces \libn, a novel framework that addresses the key limitations of current DP-DD by leveraging DP-generated data. Specifically, \lib initializes the distilled dataset with DP-generated data to enhance realism. Then, generated data refines the DP-feature matching technique to distill the original dataset under a small privacy budget, and trains an expert model to align the distilled examples with their class distribution. Furthermore, we design a privacy budget allocation strategy to determine budget consumption across DP components and provide a theoretical analysis of the overall privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments show that \lib significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DP-DD methods in terms of both dataset utility and robustness against membership inference attacks, establishing a new paradigm for privacy-preserving dataset distillation.

Abstract: AI programming assistants have demonstrated a tendency to generate code containing basic security vulnerabilities. While developers are ultimately responsible for validating and reviewing such outputs, improving the inherent quality of these generated code snippets remains essential. A key contributing factor to insecure outputs is the presence of vulnerabilities in the training datasets used to build large language models (LLMs). To address this issue, we propose curating training data to include only code that is free from detectable vulnerabilities. In this study, we constructed a secure dataset by filtering an existing Python corpus using a static analysis tool to retain only vulnerability-free functions. We then trained two transformer-based models: one on the curated dataset and one on the original, unfiltered dataset. The models were evaluated on both the correctness and security of the code they generated in response to natural language function descriptions. Our results show that the model trained on the curated dataset produced outputs with fewer security issues, while maintaining comparable functional correctness. These findings highlight the importance of secure training data in improving the reliability of AI-based programming assistants, though further enhancements to model architecture and evaluation are needed to reinforce these outcomes.

Abstract: The increasingly sophisticated environment in which attackers operate makes software security an even greater challenge in open-source projects, where malicious packages are prevalent. Static analysis tools, such as Malcontent, are highly useful but are often incapable of dealing with obfuscated malware. Such situations lead to an unreasonably high rate of false positives. This paper highlights that dynamic analysis, rather than static analysis, provides greater insight but is also more resource-intensive for understanding software behaviour during execution. In this study, we enhance a dynamic analysis tool, package-analysis, to capture key runtime behaviours, including commands executed, files accessed, and network communications. This modification enables the use of container sandboxing technologies, such as gVisor, to analyse potentially malicious packages without significantly compromising the host system.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.

Abstract: The OPC UA protocol is becoming the de facto standard for Industry 4.0 machine-to-machine communication. It stands out as one of the few industrial protocols that provide robust security features designed to prevent attackers from manipulating and damaging critical infrastructures. However, prior works showed that significant challenges still exists to set up secure OPC UA deployments in practice, mainly caused by the complexity of certificate management in industrial scenarios and the inconsistent implementation of security features across industrial OPC UA devices. In this paper, we present Pk-IOTA, an automated solution designed to secure OPC UA communications by integrating programmable data plane switches for in-network certificate validation and leveraging the IOTA Tangle for decen- tralized certificate distribution. Our evaluation is performed on a physical testbed representing a real-world industrial scenario and shows that Pk-IOTA introduces a minimal overhead while providing a scalable and tamper-proof mechanism for OPC UA certificate management.

Abstract: Password updates are a critical account security measure and an essential part of the password lifecycle. Service providers and common security recommendations advise users to update their passwords in response to incidents or as a critical cyber hygiene measure. However, password update processes are often cumbersome and require manual password creation. Inconsistent and complex workflows and a lack of automation capabilities for password managers further negatively impact overall password security.
  In this work, we perform the first in-depth systematic analysis of 111 password update processes deployed on top-ranked websites. We provide novel insights into their overall security, usability, and automation capabilities and contribute to authentication security research through a better understanding of password update processes. Websites deploy highly diverse, often complex, confusing password update processes and lack the support of password managers. Processes are often hard to use, and end-users can barely transfer experiences and knowledge across websites. Notably, protective measures designed to enhance security frequently obstruct password manager automation. We conclude our work by discussing our findings and giving recommendations for web developers, the web standardization community, and security researchers.

Abstract: A simple and practical method for achieving everlasting privacy in e-voting systems, without relying on advanced cryptographic techniques, is to use anonymous voter credentials. The simplicity of this approach may, however, create some challenges, when combined with other security features, such as cast-as-intended verifiability with second device and second-factor authentication.
  This paper considers a simple augmentation to the anonymous credential mechanism, using perfectly hiding commitments to link such credentials to the voter identities. This solution strengthens the binding between voters and their credentials while preserving everlasting privacy. It ensures that published ballots remain unlinkable to voter identities, yet enables necessary consistency checks during ballot casting and ballot auditing

Abstract: Federated learning synchronizes models through gradient transmission and aggregation. However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce Gradient-Guided Conditional Diffusion Models (GG-CDMs) for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.

Abstract: One of the key advantages of Federated Learning (FL) is its ability to collaboratively train a Machine Learning (ML) model while keeping clients' data on-site. However, this can create a false sense of security. Despite not sharing private data increases the overall privacy, prior studies have shown that gradients exchanged during the FL training remain vulnerable to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). These attacks allow reconstructing the clients' local data, breaking the privacy promise of FL. GIAs can be launched by either a passive or an active server. In the latter case, a malicious server manipulates the global model to facilitate data reconstruction. While effective, earlier attacks falling under this category have been demonstrated to be detectable by clients, limiting their real-world applicability. Recently, novel active GIAs have emerged, claiming to be far stealthier than previous approaches. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of these claims, investigating four state-of-the-art GIAs. We propose novel lightweight client-side detection techniques, based on statistically improbable weight structures and anomalous loss and gradient dynamics. Extensive evaluation across several configurations demonstrates that our methods enable clients to effectively detect active GIAs without any modifications to the FL training protocol.

Abstract: In several jurisdictions, the regulatory framework on the release and sharing of personal data is being extended to machine learning (ML). The implicit assumption is that disclosing a trained ML model entails a privacy risk for any personal data used in training comparable to directly releasing those data. However, given a trained model, it is necessary to mount a privacy attack to make inferences on the training data. In this concept paper, we examine the main families of privacy attacks against predictive and generative ML, including membership inference attacks (MIAs), property inference attacks, and reconstruction attacks. Our discussion shows that most of these attacks seem less effective in the real world than what a prima face interpretation of the related literature could suggest.

Abstract: Provenance-based intrusion detection is an increasingly popular application of graphical machine learning in cybersecurity, where system activities are modeled as provenance graphs to capture causality and correlations among potentially malicious actions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective.This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ensuring safe operation of systems subject to input nonlinearities and time-varying safety constraints. We formulate robust time-varying control barrier functions by combining two ingredients: (i) time-varying control barrier functions which capture the time-varying safety constraints, and (ii) pointwise-in-time quadratic constraints that bound the nonlinearity. These ingredients are used to design a safety filter. This filter ensures safety while minimally altering the command from a given baseline controller. The safety filter is implemented as the solution of a second-order cone program, which can be efficiently computed online. The approach is demonstrated on a simple car obstacle avoidance scenario.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of safe autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-filled environments using only local sensory information. We propose a smooth feedback controller derived from an unconstrained penalty-based formulation that guarantees safety by construction. The controller modifies an arbitrary nominal input through a closed-form expression. The resulting closed-form feedback has a projection structure that interpolates between the nominal control and its orthogonal projection onto the obstacle boundary, ensuring forward invariance of a user-defined safety margin. The control law depends only on the distance and bearing to obstacles and requires no map, switching, or set construction. When the nominal input is a gradient descent of a navigation potential, we prove that the closed-loop system achieves almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) to the goal. Undesired equilibria are shown to be unstable under a mild geometric curvature condition, which compares the normal curvature of the obstacle boundary with that of the potential level sets. We refer to the proposed method as SPF (Safe Penalty-based Feedback), which ensures safe and smooth navigation with minimal computational overhead, as demonstrated through simulations in complex 2D and 3D environments.

Abstract: Hybrid assistive systems that integrate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons offer a promising approach for neurorehabilitation. However, control of these systems remains challenging due to actuator redundancy and heterogeneous assistive device constraints. This paper introduces a novel cooperative control architecture based on dynamic allocation to address actuator redundancy in a hybrid FES-exoskeleton system. The proposed approach employs a modular control allocator that redistributes required control torques between FES and exoskeleton actuators in real time, accounting for device-specific limitations and user preferences (e.g., prioritizing one assistive device over another). Within this framework, the high-level controller determines the total assistance level, while the allocator dynamically distributes control effort based on these assistive device-specific considerations. Simulation results and experimental validation demonstrate the method's effectiveness in resolving actuator redundancy in the FES-exoskeleton system while reflecting actuator constraints, indicating its potential for deployment in clinical studies to assess patient acceptance and clinical efficacy.

Abstract: This paper studies a class of consensus dynamics where the interactions between agents are affected by a time-varying unknown scaling factor. This situation is encountered in the control of robotic fleets over a wireless network or in opinion dynamics where the confidence given to the peers varies in time. Firstly, we establish conditions under which practical upper and lower bounds on the consensus value can be determined. Secondly, we propose control strategies for allocating a given control budget to shift agent states towards a desired consensus value despite the uncertainty. We provide computationally efficient linear programming-based approaches for both problems and validate the obtained results in numerical simulations.

Abstract: Vessels navigating in confined waters are subject to banking effects, which are hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from pressure differentials between the vessel sides, significantly affecting manoeuvrability and safety. Existing numerical approaches such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can accurately capture these effects but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time control or estimation. This paper presents a closed-form, first-principles model of banking effects. The model coefficients are identified using physics-informed regression on towing tank experiment data for a scaled container vessel. Validation through Shapley value analysis confirms the significance of the banking terms in reproducing the measured forces and moments. Lastly, the derived coefficients are shown to be non-dimensional, making the model applicable across different scales that preserve vessel geometry.

Abstract: Propellant sloshing is a well-known, but not completely mastered phenomenon in space vehicles. It is particularly critical in both microgravity environments - such as interplanetary spacecraft requiring high pointing stability - and high-g conditions, as encountered during launch, re-entry, and landing. In both cases, sloshing can significantly affect vehicle performance and stability, and must often be explicitly considered in the design of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) subsystem.
  For stability analysis and control design, the most common approach to modeling sloshing is through an equivalent mechanical representation, where the moving propellant is treated as a mechanical system interacting with the rigid (or flexible) spacecraft. Pendulum-based models and mass-spring-damper systems are widely used by control analysts to assess sloshing-induced perturbations on vehicles subjected to persistent non-gravitational acceleration along one of their body axes.
  In this work, we present a rigorous mathematical formulation of pendulum dynamics, starting from a single spherical pendulum attached to a rigid spacecraft. We derive the nonlinear equations of motion for this 8-degree-of-freedom multi-body system, and then extend the formulation to include multiple pendulums, representing multiple sloshing modes within a tank and/or multiple tanks on the same vehicle. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding linearized equations of motion, explicitly accounting for a nominal longitudinal force acting on the vehicle - consistent with the high-g sloshing regime - expressed in either the inertial or body frame. Finally, we demonstrate the mathematical equivalence between the pendulum and mass-spring-damper models and validate the proposed models through time-domain simulation and frequency-domain analysis.

Abstract: Modern aerospace defense systems increasingly rely on autonomous decision-making to coordinate large numbers of interceptors against multiple incoming threats. Conventional weapon-target assignment (WTA) algorithms, including mixed-integer programming and auction-based methods, show limitations in dynamic and uncertain tactical environments where human-like reasoning and adaptive prioritization are required. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM) driven WTA framework that integrates generalized intelligence into cooperative missile guidance. The proposed system formulates the tactical decision process as a reasoning problem, in which an LLM evaluates spatial and temporal relationships among interceptors, targets, and defended assets to generate real-time assignments. In contrast to classical optimization methods, the approach leverages contextual mission data such as threat direction, asset priority, and closing velocity to adapt dynamically and reduce assignment switching. A dedicated simulation environment supports both static and dynamic assignment modes. Results demonstrate improved consistency, adaptability, and mission-level prioritization, establishing a foundation for integrating generalized artificial intelligence into tactical guidance systems.

Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems excel at correlational pattern matching but fail to achieve genuine causal understanding, a limitation often described as the "Kepler versus Newton" problem. We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.

Abstract: Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states.
  Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.

Abstract: This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Hence, this study explores large-signal stability guarantees of a promising distributed control framework for cyber-physical DC microgrids, ensuring proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. The proposed control framework adopts nonlinear nested control loops--inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed)--specifically designed to simultaneously achieve the control objectives. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops. In particular, by saturating the influence of the outer loop controller in the inner loop, the proposed controller preserves a more convenient mathematical structure, facilitating the scalability of the stability proof using Lyapunov arguments. The effectiveness of our proposed control strategy is supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid following a careful tuning strategy, and a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.

To prove the effectiveness of our method, our findings are supported by testing the control method in a time-domain simulation case study involving a low-voltage DC microgrid, as well as a small-signal stability analysis

Abstract: Certifying feasibility in decision-making, critical in many industries, can be framed as a constraint satisfaction problem. This paper focuses on characterising a subset of parameter values from an a priori set that satisfy constraints on a directed acyclic graph of constituent functions. The main assumption is that these functions and constraints may be evaluated for given parameter values, but they need not be known in closed form and could result from expensive or proprietary simulations. This setting lends itself to using sampling methods to gain an inner approximation of the feasible domain. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, the paper contributes new methodology to leverage the graph structure for decomposing the problem into lower-dimensional subproblems defined on the respective nodes. The working hypothesis that the Cartesian product of the solution sets yielded by the subproblems will tighten the a priori parameter domain, before solving the full problem defined on the graph, is demonstrated through four case studies relevant to machine learning and engineering. Future research will extend this approach to cyclic graphs and account for parametric uncertainty.

Abstract: We present verifiable conditions for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety under bounded controls. These sufficient conditions ensure the strict compatibility of a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. An explicit smooth control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) is then constructed via a patching formula that is provably correct by design. Two examples illustrate the computational procedure, showing that the proposed approach is less conservative than sum-of-squares (SOS)-based compatible CBF-CLF designs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Safe planning of an autonomous agent in interactive environments -- such as the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles -- poses a major challenge as the behavior of the environment is unknown and reactive to the behavior of the autonomous agent. This coupling gives rise to interaction-driven distribution shifts where the autonomous agent's control policy may change the environment's behavior, thereby invalidating safety guarantees in existing work. Indeed, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP) to generate distribution-free safety guarantees using observed data of the environment. However, CP's assumption on data exchangeability is violated in interactive settings due to a circular dependency where a control policy update changes the environment's behavior, and vice versa. To address this gap, we propose an iterative framework that robustly maintains safety guarantees across policy updates by quantifying the potential impact of a planned policy update on the environment's behavior. We realize this via adversarially robust CP where we perform a regular CP step in each episode using observed data under the current policy, but then transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting the CP result to account for distribution shifts. This adjustment is performed based on a policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis, resulting in a safe, episodic open-loop planner. We further conduct a contraction analysis of the system providing conditions under which both the CP results and the policy updates are guaranteed to converge. We empirically demonstrate these safety and convergence guarantees on a two-dimensional car-pedestrian case study. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such interactive settings.
