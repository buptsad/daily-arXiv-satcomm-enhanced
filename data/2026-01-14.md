### [1] [Modal Parameter Extraction via Propeller-Driven Vibration Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08123)
*Gabriele Dessena,Alessandro Pontillo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文验证了使用螺旋桨振动测试（PVT）获取低频结构模态的可行性，尤其适合替代或补充传统地面振动测试（GVT），但需考虑高阶模态和低油门下的频率漂移及谐波遮蔽问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低航空器认证过程中的时间与成本，探索可在不需完整航班或地面大规模设备情况下获取结构模态信息的替代方案。

Method: 使用七个加速度计测量铝合金翼梁，在驱动电机与螺旋桨的不同油门状态下进行振动激励，随后采用自然激励技术与Loewner框架(NExT-LF)提取模态参数，并通过MAC评估重复性。

Result: 在PVT条件下基本模态（前两阶）与基线非常匹配（MAC>0.99），第三阶受螺旋桨弯扭耦合影响，频率漂移更大且MAC降至0.827；低油门产生窄带谐波，易遮蔽结构峰。

Conclusion: PVT可作为GVT的低频模态提取可行补充，显示出足够的重复性与准确性，但在高阶模式与低油门条件下受限。

Abstract: Ground Vibration Testing (GVT) supports aircraft certification but often requires lengthy and costly campaigns. Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning.

Conclusion: 本文总结了基于等离子体标签的Meta-Backscatter系统在提升BF-IoT通信距离方面的潜力，并指出了实现此目标所面临的主要技术挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Battery-free Internet of Things (BF-IoT) enabled by backscatter communication is a rapidly evolving technology offering advantages of low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and robustness. However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers. Moreover, we present the implementation of a meta-backscatter system prototype and report the experimental results based on it. Finally, we conclude by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.

### [4] [SDP: A Unified Protocol and Benchmarking Framework for Reproducible Wireless Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08463)
*Di Zhang,Jiawei Huang,Yuanhao Cui,Xiaowen Cao,Tony Xiao Han,Xiaojun Jing,Christos Masouros*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提供统一协议与基准，提升无线感知研究的可复现性与公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习驱动的无线感知缺乏统一可复现的实验基础，硬件依赖导致方法难以公平比较

Method: 提出Sensing Data Protocol（SDP），通过统一底层清洗、张量构造及训练评估流程，抽象硬件差异

Result: 在复杂活动识别任务中，SDP显著降低随机种子波动，实现与传统方法相当的准确率，并在商用Wi‑Fi硬件上验证跨设备互操作性

Conclusion: SDP为无线感知提供可复现、可比测的基准，推动从实验性探索向可靠工程实践转变

Abstract: Learning-based wireless sensing has made rapid progress, yet the field still lacks a unified and reproducible experimental foundation. Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.
  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice.

Abstract: This paper introduces a scheme for drone surveillance coordinated with the fifth generation (5G) synchronization signal block (SSB) cell-search procedure to simultaneously detect low-altitude drones within a volumetric surveillance grid. Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude.

Conclusion: 时变扩散-对流通道可用通信理论工具系统性建模与设计，为复杂流动环境中的粒子通信提供了现实基础。

Abstract: Particle based communication using diffusion and advection has emerged as an alternative signaling paradigm recently. While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments.

Conclusion: 随机过滤（RF）为在大规模高维数据上保留流形几何的降维提供了一种无需昂贵训练、计算高效且数据无关的方法。其在多种模拟与真实案例中验证了对数据结构的良好保留及对后续任务的提升。

Abstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.

Abstract: Wireless sensing has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent environments, supporting applications such as human detection, activity recognition, localization, and vital sign monitoring. Despite rapid advances, existing datasets and pipelines remain fragmented across sensing modalities, hindering fair comparison, transfer, and reproducibility. We propose the Sensing Dataset Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level specification and benchmark framework for large-scale wireless sensing. SDP defines how heterogeneous wireless signals are mapped into a unified perception data-block schema through lightweight synchronization, frequency-time alignment, and resampling, while a Canonical Polyadic-Alternating Least Squares (CP-ALS) pooling stage provides a task-agnostic representation that preserves multipath, spectral, and temporal structures. Built upon this protocol, a unified benchmark is established for detection, recognition, and vital-sign estimation with consistent preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Experiments under the cross-user split demonstrate that SDP significantly reduces variance (approximately 88%) across seeds while maintaining competitive accuracy and latency, confirming its value as a reproducible foundation for multi-modal and multitask sensing research.

Conclusion: ENACHI有效解决设备-边缘协作推理中的三方权衡，通过层级调度与渐进传输显著提升准确率与能耗效率，并实现良好可扩展性。

Abstract: Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.

Abstract: This paper considers a downlink Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) system within a physically-consistent setting, accounting for the effect of mutual coupling between RIS elements arising due to sub-element spacing. The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a decentralized system for issuing and verifying academic certificates based on blockchain technology. The proposed solution addresses common limitations of traditional certification models, such as susceptibility to forgery, reliance on centralized infrastructures, and inefficient verification processes. The system is built on the TRON blockchain and integrates smart contracts written in Solidity, a decentralized web application (dApp) for user interaction, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage of certificate metadata.

Experimental results show that the system correctly supports certificate issuance and public verification, enforces access control, and resists common misuse scenarios. Performance analysis indicates low confirmation latency and negligible transaction costs, making the solution suitable for large-scale academic environments. Additionally, usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS) resulted in a score of 76.67, indicating good user acceptance. Overall, the results demonstrate the technical feasibility and practical viability of the proposed approach, highlighting the TRON blockchain as an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure for decentralized academic certification systems.

### [12] [Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low Rank Compression of LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07839)
*Pawan Kumar,Aditi Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对单个大语言模型的自注意力矩阵采用两阶段层次稀疏低秩压缩，30%稀疏+512秩即可在保持或提升语言建模性能的同时显著降低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型对内存和计算资源要求极高，势必需要压缩技术以实现部署和后续训练。

Method: 先将最高幅值权重抽取为稀疏矩阵S，再对残差矩阵递归应用层次稀疏可分离(HSS)低秩分解；通过递归秩降低和逆Cuthill-McKee置换，将高权重集中于对角，提升对角之外可压缩性。该压缩方案能够直接用标准优化器端到端训练，且矩阵向量乘法仅需一次稀疏乘法和一系列细矩阵乘法，适配硬件。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B上仅压缩自注意力投影(共1.6B参数)，在30%稀疏度、外部秩512下，sHSS-RCM在WikiText测试集上取得1.64的perplexity，优于密集基线和传统稀疏+SVD方法，同时显著降低内存占用。

Conclusion: 层次稀疏+低秩(HSS)压缩在大规模模型上可实现高效的压缩与训练，且符合硬件特性。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) place extraordinary pressure on memory and compute budgets, making principled compression indispensable for both deployment and continued training. We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual matrix. A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once). HSS is hardware-friendly: its matrix-vector multiply reduces to one sparse and a sequence of thin-matrix multiplications and can be trained end-to-end with standard optimisers.
  Experiments on LLaMA-7B show that targeting only the self-attention projections (1.6 B parameters of Q, K, and V matrices out of a total 7B parameters) suffices to yield large memory savings while retaining comparable state-of-the-art perplexity scores on test samples of the WikiText dataset. For example, with a 30\% sparsity budget and an outer rank of 512, sHSS-RCM achieves a perplexity of 1.64, outperforming dense baselines and classical sparse-plus-SVD variants, while also achieving significant memory savings.

*Nina Peire,Yupei Li,Björn Schuller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 正则化CL在EEG情感分类中因受试者差异和噪声导致功能受限，无法显著提升前向迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG情感分类中未知受试者泛化受限的挑战

Method: 对比分析正则化类连续学习方法(EWC、SI、MAS)在DREAMER和SEED数据集上的理论及实验表现

Result: 发现正则化方法在稳定‑可塑性折衷上偏向减轻灾难性遗忘，导致在受试者增量序列中表现欠佳；梯度冲突、任务均衡缺失及受试者顺序敏感均限制性能；正向迁移并未显著优于逐步微调

Conclusion: 正则化型连续学习方法对EEG情感分类的未知受试者泛化效果有限，需寻找更适合的策略

Abstract: Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.

TL;DR: HOSC=\tanh(β sin(ω0x))提供可调Lipschitz的周期激活，实验验证其在管理梯度、保留高频特征方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统周期激活如正弦保持高频信息但梯度不稳定、难以控制多尺度行为；需一种能保持周期性同时可调梯度幅值的激活函数。

Method: 提出HOSC激活函数$\mathrm{HOSC}(x)=\tanh\bigl(β\sin(ω_0x)\bigr)$，通过β可显式控制激活的Lipschitz常数，并在图像、音频、视频、NeRF、SDF等标准实验中进行定量对比。

Result: 在多种数据和任务上，HOSC在稳健性、表达力与收敛速度方面优于或可与SIREN、FINER等方法匹敌，并提供了域感知的超参数选择指导。

Conclusion: HOSC通过可调的β参数为隐式神经表示提供了稳定的周期激活函数，实验表明其在多领域中与SIREN、FINER等方法竞争并取得明显提升。

Abstract: Periodic activations such as sine preserve high-frequency information in implicit neural representations (INRs) through their oscillatory structure, but often suffer from gradient instability and limited control over multi-scale behavior. We introduce the Hyperbolic Oscillator with Saturation Control (HOSC) activation, $\text{HOSC}(x) = \tanh\bigl(β\sin(ω_0 x)\bigr)$, which exposes an explicit parameter $β$ that controls the Lipschitz bound of the activation by $βω_0$. This provides a direct mechanism to tune gradient magnitudes while retaining a periodic carrier. We provide a mathematical analysis and conduct a comprehensive empirical study across images, audio, video, NeRFs, and SDFs using standardized training protocols. Comparative analysis against SIREN, FINER, and related methods shows where HOSC provides substantial benefits and where it achieves competitive parity. Results establish HOSC as a practical periodic activation for INR applications, with domain-specific guidance on hyperparameter selection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统增量编辑方法在顺序编辑中会导致数值不稳定，影响编辑效果和通用能力，需要一种能保持数值稳定的编辑框架。

Method: 通过先推导乘法形式的矩阵更新，将新知识嵌入正交矩阵，再将其乘以原始参数矩阵，以保持矩阵的条件数和范数不变。

Result: MOSE实现了12.08%的顺序编辑性能提升，并维持了95.73%的下游任务通用能力，且编辑矩阵偏差受到有效限制。

Conclusion: 本文提出了乘法正交序列编辑（MOSE）方法，使用正交矩阵乘法更新参数，从而在不破坏数值稳定性的前提下实现知识编辑，并在多种LLM上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently modify the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) without compromising their other capabilities. The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

Abstract: This work introduces NOVAK, a modular gradient-based optimization algorithm that integrates adaptive moment estimation, rectified learning-rate scheduling, decoupled weight regularization, multiple variants of Nesterov momentum, and lookahead synchronization into a unified, performance-oriented framework. NOVAK adopts a dual-mode architecture consisting of a streamlined fast path designed for production. The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers. The results highlight that NOVAKs architectural contributions (particularly rectification, decoupled decay, and hybrid momentum) are crucial for reliable training of deep plain networks lacking skip connections, addressing a long-standing limitation of existing adaptive optimization methods.

Motivation: EEG情绪识别受限于个体差异、标签稀缺且缺乏可解释推理，现有多模态LLM未能处理神经信号的时空特征。

Method: 结合预训练EEG编码器与Qwen LLM，通过可学习投影层实现跨模态对齐，并采用情绪区辨预训练、交叉模态对齐、指令调优+链式推理的三阶段训练流程。

Result: 在七种情绪类别的数据集上，E^2-LLM实现了优异的分类性能；更大变体在零样本复杂推理任务中表现出更高的可靠性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E^2-LLM为基于EEG的情绪识别提供了可解释的多模态大语言模型框架，证明了模型规模提升可显著提升识别准确性和零样本推理能力。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains challenging due to high inter-subject variability, limited labeled data, and the lack of interpretable reasoning in existing approaches. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing.

Conclusion: 该工作通过在极低位数量化中加入切片Wasserstein损失，实现了对原模型输出分布的对齐，显著恢复了量化后性能，提升了前沿量化框架的准确率。

Abstract: The benefits of most large language models come with steep and often hidden economic and environmental costs due to their resource usage inefficiency during deployment. Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization.

Our results demonstrate that multivariate max-min structure of operators, besides their algebraic elegance, provide efficient and stable approximation tools in both theoretical and applied settings.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is increasingly hindered by prohibitive memory and computational requirements. While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Abstract: Many real-world tasks require optimizing expensive black-box functions accessible only through noisy evaluations, a setting commonly addressed with Bayesian optimization (BO). While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines.

Motivation: 虽然LLM在统计学习与泛化方面表现优异，但它们在内部化处理数据、执行算法方面存在局限性。需要一种训练方法来弥补其算法执行的短板。

Method: 针对算法执行任务，设计一种“分解推理”训练框架，命名为 LLM‑DAL，并在专门构造的算法数据集上进行监督学习。该方法把大模型的推理过程拆解成可解的子步骤，逐步引导模型学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently developed new advanced functionalities. Their effectiveness relies on statistical learning and generalization capabilities. However, they face limitations in internalizing the data they process and struggle, for instance, to autonomously execute algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of extending these models' capabilities to algorithm execution through specialized supervised training focused on reasoning decomposition. We introduce a training model called LLM-DAL (Large Language Model - Decompositional Algorithmic Learning), through which we demonstrate that LLMs' ability to perform complex algorithmic inferences and generalize can be significantly improved when the training method is properly designed to guide the model in its learning process.

TL;DR: 提出 LVICL，用向量注入方式提升冻结大型语言模型在时间序列预测中的性能，既高效又保持计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时间序列预测中表现良好，但预训练语料库与时间序列数据差异大，直接使用会影响效果；微调能改善但计算成本高。需要在不更新模型参数的前提下提高预测质量。

Method: 基于向量注入的上下文学习（LVICL）：先用可学习的上下文向量适配器自适应提取示例信息压缩为上下文向量，然后在前向传播时在每一层注入该向量，从而激发冻结 LLM 的内在学习能力。

Result: 相较于传统的基于提示的 ICL，LVICL 不增加提示长度，同时通过自适应提取上下文向量抑制有害成分，显著提升了预测性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LVICL 通过向冻结的 LLM 注入可学习的上下文向量，在保持参数不变的同时显著提升时间序列预测性能，且不增加提示长度，显示出对 LLM4TSF 的有效改进。

Abstract: The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Federated learning protocols require repeated synchronization between clients and a central server, with convergence rates depending on learning rates, data heterogeneity, and client sampling. This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\times$ less communication. The framework applies to kernel methods and random feature models but not to general nonlinear architectures.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted focus from general-purpose capabilities to domain-specific expertise. However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the "Stability-Plasticity Dilemma", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) "Task Interference", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a "Knowledge-Preservation Plugin", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: Data-driven flow-field reconstruction typically relies on autoencoder architectures that compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent representations. However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线RL中，稀疏奖励与长时程目标导致学习困难。传统的子目标分解忽略了子目标间的时间依赖，且奖励塑形不够精确，导致策略子优化。需要一种能够将大语言模型已知的任务结构与奖励塑形结合的方法。

2)依据生成的时间结构对稀疏奖励进行势能奖励塑形。
3)将塑形后的奖励与原始数据合并构成增强数据集，进行离线RL训练。


Result: 在四个离散与连续稀疏奖励基准上，STO-RL超越当前最先进的基线，收敛更快、成功率更高且轨迹长度更短。同时对LLM生成子目标序列的鲁棒性检验表明，即使序列存在噪声，模型仍能保持优秀性能。


Conclusion: STO-RL框架通过LLM生成的时间顺序子目标序列与对应的状态-子目标映射，利用势能奖励塑形将稀疏终端奖励转化为稠密的、时间一致的反馈，显著提升了长时程离线RL任务的学习效果。


Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.

In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $ε$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $ε$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of deep reinforcement learning in local search.

TL;DR: RFM 通过逆推理及 Stein 控制变量，统一并优化噪声/梯度期望方法，显著提升在线 RL 中扩散及流策略的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线强化学习中，扩散和流策略因表达力强而受到关注，但训练效率低是关键瓶颈。目标分布在实际操作中是未归一化的 Boltzmann 分布，仅能通过 Q 函数获得，需要在缺乏直接样本的情况下学习。

Method: 提出统一框架逆流匹配（Reverse Flow Matching，RFM），将训练目标视为给定噪声样本时的后验均值估计。通过引入 Langevin Stein 操作构造零均值控制变量，得到一类通用估计器，涵盖原先的噪声期望和梯度期望两种方法。

Result: 证明两种既有方法是该框架的特例；通过同时使用 Q 值与 Q 梯度信息，可获得最优、最小方差的估计器，从而提升训练效率与稳定性。实验表明，用 RFM 训练流政策，在连续控制基准上优于扩散政策基线。

Conclusion: RFM 为扩散与流策略的训练提供了统一、理论保障的通用框架，既拓展了目标 Boltzmann 分布的适用范围，也实现了更高效、更稳定的在线 RL 训练。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow policies are gaining prominence in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressive power, yet training them efficiently remains a critical challenge. A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the go-to model for graph data analysis. However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: "How important is a node to the structure of the graph?" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Riemannian zeroth-order optimization in settings where the underlying Riemannian metric $g$ is geodesically incomplete, and the goal is to approximate stationary points with respect to this incomplete metric. To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开 LLM 在预训练期已安全对齐，但微调往往破坏此对齐，现有防御捆绑在训练或成本高昂的后处理流程，亟需一种解耦且高效的后训练安全恢复方法。

Method: 在微调后利用后训练量化技术，将量化视为双目标（压缩+安全）过程，依据表示层结构分析进行引导，实现了安全对齐与微调解耦。

Result: 在多模型、多数据集上实验表明，Q-realign 能显著降低不安全行为，保持任务性能，同时显著节省内存和 GPU 计算时间。以 7B LLM 为例，单张 RTX 4090 内在 40 分钟即可完成安全恢复。

Conclusion: Q-realign 通过后训练量化实现了安全对齐的恢复和压缩，显著降低不安全行为且保持任务性能，提供了一种可直接嵌入部署流水线的实用方案。

Abstract: Public large language models (LLMs) are typically safety-aligned during pretraining, yet task-specific fine-tuning required for deployment often erodes this alignment and introduces safety risks. Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.

*Zheng Zhou,Isabella McEvoy,Camilo E. Valderrama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer‑based fusion of channel‑level and trial‑level EEG features, with attention, domain‑adversarial training, and intensity filtering, yields ~40% mean accuracy for subject‑independent 7‑class emotion recognition on SEED‑VII.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter‑subject variability and short, noisy recordings hinder generalization in subject‑independent EEG emotion recognition. Robust representations that capture both fine‑grained channel information and broader trial characteristics can mitigate this issue.

Method: Local per‑channel descriptors combine differential entropy and graph‑theoretic features; global descriptors aggregate time‑domain, spectral and complexity metrics. These are fed into a dual‑branch transformer whose two streams are fused via attention; domain‑adversarial regularization guides the network to learn subject‑invariant features. Samples below a predefined intensity threshold are filtered out.

Result: In a leave‑one‑subject‑out protocol on SEED‑VII, the method consistently exceeds single‑view and classical baselines, achieving about 40% mean accuracy across seven emotion classes.

Conclusion: The proposed dual‑branch transformer framework that fuses local channel‑wise descriptors with global trial‑level descriptors, enhanced by attention‑based fusion, domain‑adversarial regularization and intensity‑threshold filtering, improves subject‑independent EEG emotion recognition accuracy on the SEED‑VII dataset.

Abstract: Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is challenged by pronounced inter-subject variability and the difficulty of learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在实际问题中存在的需要通过组合原始测量得到的信号时，XGBoost 的列抽样机制是否会阻碍模型自然学习这些组合关系。

Method: 通过在XGBoost中改变colsample_bylevel 和 colsample_bynode 超参数，对两种带有取消结构的合成数据进行实验，并使用 PR‑AUC 评估性能，结合路径共用度量分析特征在树中的协同使用情况。

Result: 在仅使用原始特征时，列抽样导致 PR‑AUC 降低，最高下降 54%；而包含已工程化的比值特征时，降低几乎消失。路径共用度量也与性能下降对应。

Conclusion: 在梯度提升树中，内部列抽样会使得 синтез比值特征更加困难，从而显著降低模型在未工程化特征情况下的性能；但若已构造比值特征，则该影响几乎消失。

Abstract: Many applied problems contain signal that becomes clear only after combining multiple raw measurements. Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has driven broad advances across scientific and engineering domains. Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.

Conclusion: RCF提供了一种可与深度学习兼容、计算效率极高的几何演化框架，可广泛应用于大规模图数据的构造与优化。

Abstract: Geometric Representation Learning (GRL) aims to approximate the non-Euclidean topology of high-dimensional data through discrete graph structures, grounded in the manifold hypothesis. However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Tabular foundational models are pre-trained models designed for a wide range of tabular data tasks. They have shown strong performance across domains, yet their internal representations and learned concepts remain poorly understood. This lack of interpretability makes it important to study how these models process and transform input features. In this work, we analyze the information encoded inside the model's hidden representations and examine how these representations evolve across layers. We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models. They show that these models encode concrete and interpretable information, which moves us closer to making their decision processes more transparent and trustworthy.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.

Abstract: Financial markets are influenced by human behavior that deviates from rationality due to cognitive biases. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models for financial decision-making assume rational agents, potentially overlooking the impact of psychological factors. This study integrates cognitive biases into RL frameworks for financial trading, hypothesizing that such models can exhibit human-like trading behavior and achieve better risk-adjusted returns than standard RL agents. We introduce biases, such as overconfidence and loss aversion, into reward structures and decision-making processes and evaluate their performance in simulated and real-world trading environments. Despite its inconclusive or negative results, this study provides insights into the challenges of incorporating human-like biases into RL, offering valuable lessons for developing robust financial AI systems.

Abstract: In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.

Abstract: We analyze initialization dynamics for LDLT-based $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz layers by deriving the exact marginal output variance when the underlying parameter matrix $W_0\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is initialized with IID Gaussian entries $\mathcal{N}(0,σ^2)$. The Wishart distribution, $S=W_0W_0^\top\sim\mathcal{W}_m(n,σ^2 \boldsymbol{I}_m)$, used for computing the output marginal variance is derived in closed form using expectations of zonal polynomials via James' theorem and a Laplace-integral expansion of $(α\boldsymbol{I}_m+S)^{-1}$. We develop an Isserlis/Wick-based combinatorial expansion for $\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}\left[\operatorname{tr}(S^k)\right]$ and provide explicit truncated moments up to $k=10$, which yield accurate series approximations for small-to-moderate $σ^2$. Monte Carlo experiments confirm the theoretical estimates. Furthermore, empirical analysis was performed to quantify that, using current He or Kaiming initialization with scaling $1/\sqrt{n}$, the output variance is $0.41$, whereas the new parameterization with $10/ \sqrt{n}$ for $α=1$ results in an output variance of $0.9$. The findings clarify why deep $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz networks suffer rapid information loss at initialization and offer practical prescriptions for choosing initialization hyperparameters to mitigate this effect. However, using the Higgs boson classification dataset, a hyperparameter sweep over optimizers, initialization scale, and depth was conducted to validate the results on real-world data, showing that although the derivation ensures variance preservation, empirical results indicate He initialization still performs better.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection aims to identify a compact subset of features that captures the intrinsic structure of data without supervised label. Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $Δ$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $Δ$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.

TL;DR: ORBIT learns multiple optimal reasoning strategies via RL, distills them into one model, allowing adjustable reasoning effort with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LRM inference requires long-chain reasoning, costly. Prior methods infer reasoning budget but are unreliable and fix tradeoff during training.

Method: Multi-stage reinforcement learning discovers Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at various effort levels, then on-policy distillation fuses them into a unified model (ORBIT).

Result: ORBIT offers controllable multi-budget reasoning modes, maintains competitive reasoning density per mode, and trains a single student model that preserves mode separation and high performance.

Conclusion: The proposed ORBIT framework successfully addresses variable reasoning costs while retaining accuracy, enabling flexible deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by leveraging long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but uniformly applying overlong reasoning at inference time incurs substantial and often unnecessary computational cost. To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.

Abstract: Deep double descent is one of the key phenomena underlying the generalization capability of deep learning models. In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a "benign overfitting" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as "outliers," "massive activa-tions," and "super activations" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of "deep double descent," "benign overfitting," and "large activation", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.

Conclusion: Simplatab在性能、效率与易用性上取得折中；然而缺乏生存分析支持、特征可复现性与标准化集成等，未来AutoML需更好适配放射组学挑战

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks can lower technical barriers for predictive and prognostic model development in radiomics by enabling researchers without programming expertise to build models. However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.

Abstract: Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise from ships contribute significantly to underwater sound pollution, posing risks to marine ecosystems. This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.

*Matina Mahdizadeh Sani,Nima Jamali,Mohammad Jalali,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training‑free diffusion guidance method that uses MMD gradients to steer sampling toward limited reference data, effectively improving domain adaptation in both unconditional and conditional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference‑time guidance tunes surrogate objectives (e.g., classifier likelihood) rather than the target distribution, creating mismatches in domain adaptation where only a few reference examples exist and model retraining is impractical.

Method: By adding gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to the reverse diffusion step—using efficient, low‑variance kernel estimates and applying the guidance in latent space—the method steers sampling toward the target distribution.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real‑world datasets show that MMD Guidance aligns generated samples more closely with reference data without degrading image quality, outperforming existing surrogate‑based methods.

Conclusion: MMD Guidance offers a training-free, inference‑time method that achieves distributional alignment between diffusion model outputs and limited reference data while maintaining sample fidelity.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.

TL;DR: SSO是一个完全对齐$\boldsymbol\mu$P的谱球优化器，具备更快收敛、更好稳定性，可在多种大模型中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型快速收敛需要稳定的优化逻辑，现有优化器如Muon仅半对齐$\boldsymbol\mu$P，导致权重漂移，缺乏严格的激活控制。

Method: 在每个模块上施加谱球约束，导出谱球上的最陡下降方向，得到一个全对齐$\boldsymbol\mu$P的优化器；实现了高效并行算法，集成至Megatron框架。

Result: 在Dense 1.7B、MoE 8B-A1B以及200层DeepNet等架构预训练中，SSO持续优于AdamW和Muon；并显著改善了MoE路由器负载平衡、抑制异常值，严格限制激活范围。

Conclusion: SSO通过在谱球上实现完全的$\boldsymbol\mu$P对齐，显著提升了大模型训练的稳定性与收敛速度，实验中多种架构的性能均优于AdamW和Muon。

Abstract: Scaling large models requires optimization strategies that ensure rapid convergence grounded in stability. Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbolμ$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $Θ(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\boldsymbolμ$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations.

Abstract: Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

Abstract: Online on-policy preference learning algorithms for language model alignment such as online direct policy optimization (DPO) can significantly outperform their offline counterparts. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.

Abstract: Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.

Abstract: We introduce Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model to integrate irregular time series and unstructured clinical narratives. We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a widely used approach for post-training large language models on reasoning tasks, with group-based methods such as GRPO and its variants gaining broad adoption. These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.
  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.

In this paper, we propose EviNAM, an extension of evidential learning that integrates the interpretability of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with principled uncertainty estimation. Unlike standard Bayesian neural networks and previous evidential methods, EviNAM enables, in a single pass, both the estimation of the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as explicit feature contributions. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that EviNAM matches state-of-the-art predictive performance. While we focus on regression, our method extends naturally to classification and generalized additive models, offering a path toward more intelligible and trustworthy predictions.

Abstract: Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy for Markov decision processes with safety constraints. We formulate the problem in a reach-avoid setup. Our goal is to design online reinforcement learning algorithms that ensure safety constraints with arbitrarily high probability during the learning phase. To this end, we first propose an algorithm based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle. Based on the first algorithm, we propose our main algorithm, which utilizes entropy regularization. We investigate the finite-sample analysis of both algorithms and derive their regret bounds. We demonstrate that the inclusion of entropy regularization improves the regret and drastically controls the episode-to-episode variability that is inherent in OFU-based safe RL algorithms.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in high-dimensional, time-dependent simulation data is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics. We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of "active ingredient" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.

Motivation: 解决LLM在面对用户异质且冲突偏好时的对齐问题，实现无偏差且个性化的可信AI。

Method: 定义(k,f(k))-稳健对齐与U-对齐，将对齐问题转化为(k+1)-玩家对称齐平博弈；利用Nash均衡策略保证任意k输出模型在与单输出模型对抗中的胜率；通过自我博弈动态证明收敛。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的对齐框架，实现了在多样候选答案中通过用户选择实现的通用对齐，并证明其收敛速度k/(k+1)是最优的，且相对于现有方法可显著提升输出多样性和自适应性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.
  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展原 CLASSIX 仅适用于欧氏距离，解决化学指纹等领域需要使用 Tanimoto 距离的聚类需求。

Method: 通过按数据向量的适当范数排序，配合三角不等式终止搜索；对Tanimoto距离引入更锐利的交集不等式加速计算。

Result: 在真实化学指纹基准上，CLASSIX Tanimoto 比 Taylor–Butina 快约 30 倍，比 DBSCAN 快约 80 倍，且聚类质量更高。

Conclusion: CLASSIX Tanimoto 高效并在非欧氏距离下保持可解释性，显著提升聚类速度和质量。

Abstract: The CLASSIX algorithm is a fast and explainable approach to data clustering. In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases.

Conclusion: 首次给出空间约束下 DNA 合成的解析界限，为未来该领域优化策略研究奠定基础。

Abstract: We study the theoretical problem of synthesizing multiple DNA strands under spatial constraints, motivated by large-scale DNA synthesis technologies. In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.

### [65] [Distributed Detection under Stringent Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07989)
*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Mireille Sarkiss,Michèle Wigger*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper shows that with limited/noisy communication, detection performance (Stein exponent) depends on whether the channel is partially or fully connected: partial yields optimal exponent, full may reduce to simple local testing—except under expectation‑only constraints where some advantage remains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental limits of distributed hypothesis testing when the remote sensor communicates over a noisy DMC with limited channel resources or input‑cost constraints.

Method: Adaptation of Han’s zero‑rate coding strategy for partially‑connected DMCs and development of new converse proofs with change‑of‑measure arguments and novel coding schemes.

Result: A sharp characterization (dichotomy) of the Stein exponent under three communication constraints, revealing dependency on the DMC transition structure; proofs of optimality and achievability provided.

Conclusion: Under stricter communication constraints, the Stein exponent behaves differently for partially-connected vs. fully-connected DMCs: in partial connectivity it equals the zero-rate noiseless link exponent, while in full connectivity the exponent collapses to that of a local test (except in scenario 3 where it remains better than local but still lower than the partial case).

Abstract: This paper identifies the Stein-exponent of distributed detection when the sensor communicates to the decision center over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) subject to one of three stringent communication constraints: 1) The number of channel uses of the DMC grows sublinearly in the number of source observations n; 2) The number of channel uses is n but a block-input cost constraint is imposed almost surely, which grows sublinearly in n; 3) The block-input constraint is imposed only on expectation. We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.
  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.
  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs.

*Thomas F. Varley*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: $Δ^{k}$ generalizes existing measures; its sign indicates the dominant interaction order, producing a hierarchy of synergies, while conjugate $Γ^{k}$ does same for redundancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data to reveal insights into complex systems' fundamental features

Method: Introduce a general function $Δ^{k}$ parametrized by $k$, showing that it subsumes existing measures (dual total correlation, S-information, O-information). Derive its conjugate $Γ^{k}$ via entropic conjugation framework.

Result: Demonstrated that varying $k$ classifies systems by dominant interaction order: $Δ^{k}>0$ indicates higher-order synergies, $Δ^{k}<0$ indicates lower-order, $Δ^{k}=0$ indicates pure order-$k$ synergy. Similar hierarchy for redundancies with $Γ^{k}$.

Conclusion: Unifies disparate higher-order information measures into a coherent hierarchical framework, revealing structure of redundant and synergistic interactions.

Abstract: Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes" and ``parts" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $Δ^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $Δ^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $Δ^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $Δ^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $Δ^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $Δ^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $Δ^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $Δ^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $Δ^{k}$, which we term $Γ^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure.

Abstract: Flag codes generalize constant dimension codes by considering sequences of nested subspaces with prescribed dimensions as codewords. A comprehensive construction, which unites cyclic orbit flag codes, yields two families of flag codes on $\mathbb{F}^n_q$ (where $n=sk+h$ with $s\geq 2$ and $0\leq h < k$): optimum distance flag codes of the longest possible type vector $(1, 2, \ldots, k, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$ and flag codes with longer type vectors $(1, 2, \ldots, k+h, 2k+h, \ldots, (s-2)k+h, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$. These flag codes achieve the same cardinality $\sum^{s-1}_{i=1}q^{ik+h}+1$.

Abstract: Current cellular systems achieve high spectral efficiency through Massive MIMO, which leverages an abundance of antennas to create favorable propagation conditions for multiuser spatial multiplexing. Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A multi‑stage approach that partitions the antenna’s motion area, uses NOMP for fine angle estimation, clusters rays to locate scatterers, and refines channel estimation—leading to better sensing and communication in near‑field ISAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the extensive positional freedom of a movable antenna—thereby turning the wireless link into a near‑field regime—to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication.

Method: 1) Partition the antenna’s movement area into subregions. 2) Apply Newtonized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (NOMP) to obtain precise angle estimates in each subregion. 3) Use Near‑Field Localization via Subregion Ray Clustering (LSRC) to jointly process subregion angles and identify scattering points. 4) Refine near‑field channel estimation based on the inferred scatterer locations.

Result: Simulation shows the proposed scheme yields superior movable‑antenna sensing precision and channel estimation, enhancing overall communication quality.

Conclusion: The newly proposed multi‑stage framework markedly improves both sensing accuracy and channel estimation in near‑field integrated sensing and communication systems enabled by a movable antenna.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.

Abstract: We study the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective, with a particular emphasis on deriving sharper bounds for differentially private algorithms. It is well known that the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms can be bounded in terms of mutual information and maximal leakage, yielding in-expectation and high-probability guarantees, respectively. In this work, we further upper bound mutual information and maximal leakage by explicit, easily computable formulas, using typicality-based arguments and exploiting the stability properties of private algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we strictly improve the mutual-information bounds by Rodríguez-Gálvez et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021). In the second part, we derive new upper bounds on the maximal leakage of learning algorithms. In both cases, the resulting bounds on information measures translate directly into generalization error guarantees.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to sample random sparse matrices to be used as check matrices for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\mathbf H\in\mathbb F_2^{r\times n}$ such that $\mathbf H\mathbf H^\top = \mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.
  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.
  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: We consider the classical problem of discrete distribution estimation using i.i.d. samples in a novel scenario where additional side information is available on the distribution. In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.

The new boundary points are achieved by a simple coding scheme that employs superposition coding at the transmitter with decode and forward at the stronger receiver. We evaluate our general result for Gaussian BCs and for a BC consisting of a binary erasure channel (BEC) to the stronger receiver and a binary symmetric channel (BSC) to the weaker receiver.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes provide a practical balance between error-correction capability and implementation complexity in quantum error correction (QEC). In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文通过引入支持分布/枚举器，对线性码的坐标层面信息进行量化，并提出对应的MacWilliams型恒等式，给出了自同一性的判定条件，丰富了对偶理论的细粒度视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的重量分布/枚举器仅聚焦于码字权重，缺乏坐标层面的信息；支持分布与枚举器可补充这一空白，深化码结构理解。

Method: 推导支持枚举器公式以计数特定坐标非零码字；利用归一化支持枚举器构造MacWilliams型恒等式；从该恒等式推出自同一性的必要与充分条件。

Result: 得到支持枚举器计数公式；提出归一化支持枚举器的MacWilliams型身份；基于该身份给出自同一性的条件；本工作补充了经典重量基对偶理论。

Conclusion: 通过支持分布和支持枚举器的提出，本文实现了对线性码坐标层面的更细粒度分析，并通过MacWilliams型身份验证了其对偶码的坐标信息传递，给出了自同一性的判定条件。

Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced the concepts of support distribution and the support enumerator as refinements of the classical weight distribution and weight enumerator respectively, capturing coordinate level activity in linear block codes. More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions. These results provide a more detailed understanding of code structure and complement classical weight based duality theory.

### [77] [Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Locally Recoverable Codes: A Probabilistic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08765)
*Hoang Ly,Emina Soljanin,Philip Whiting*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: LRC在多数逻辑解码下，在BEC/BSC上表现优异；只需轻微提升可用性，块错误率可趋近零，证实了理论上最坏案例与实际随机通道表现之间的巨大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LRC的结构性质已被广泛研究，但其在随机失真与误码场景下的实际性能仍缺乏系统分析，需要评估其在真实分布式存储系统中的有效性。

Method: 在固定局部性变动可用性的二进制LRC上，针对内存无记忆的比特擦除通道（BEC）和二进制对称通道（BSC），构造多数逻辑解码（MLD）并推导其失败概率的显式上界，进而分析误比特率（BER）和块误码率（BLER）。

Result: 给出浓度和可用性参数下BER与BLER 的显式上界；证明当可用性满足一定增长条件时，块误码率随块长指数衰减，且MLD可纠正所有与块长线性相关的误码/擦除模式。

Conclusion: 在满足可用性轻微增长的条件下，二进制线性局部可恢复码（LRC）在多数逻辑解码下，随着块长的增加其块解码失败概率趋于零，显示出与传统极端情况校验下的良好区分。

Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: LWM‑Spectro是一个Transformer预训练模型，利用自监督掩码、对比学习和MoE在I/Q spectrogram上学习通用无线表示，在多任务下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习从I/Q原始信号中获取鲁棒且可迁移的表示面对异构系统、不同传播环境和标注数据稀缺的挑战

Method: 基于Transformer的基础模型LWM‑Spectro，在时间-频谱表示上使用自监督的掩码建模、对比学习和Mixture‑of‑Experts架构进行预训练

Result: 在调制识别、联合SNR/移动性识别等下游任务中，无论是few‑shot还是数据丰富场景，LWM‑Spectro均优于现有深度学习基线，展示出统一可迁移的无线表示能力

Conclusion: LWM‑Spectro为无线学习提供了统一的、可迁移的基础模型

Abstract: The received in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) baseband signals inherently encode physical-layer and channel characteristics of wireless links. Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: NTRU is one of the important lattice-based post-quantum cryptography methods, offering resistance against quantum computing attacks. However, a drawback of NTRU lies in its relatively low efficiency in generating key pairs. Therefore, this study proposes an NTRU-based key expansion method that enables efficient public key expansion. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to an anonymous certificate scheme, allowing an end entity to generate a key pair only once, after which the certificate authority can expand multiple distinct public keys for anonymity. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed key expansion method achieves significantly higher efficiency than key pair generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Financial agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for investment analysis, risk assessment, and automated decision-making, where their abilities to plan, invoke tools, and manipulate mutable state introduce new security risks in high-stakes and highly regulated financial environments. However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses.

TL;DR: 忘记指纹利用概率忘记痕迹回避高困惑度触发器，并通过情境关联验证模型所有权，实验证明其高成功率与低误报


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门指纹因高困惑度触发器、易被检测以及对正常输入产生伪激活而不可靠，需要一种更隐蔽、不易被过滤且鲁棒的所有权验证方法

Method: 通过构造可读的 key–value 集合，使用助手模型和预测熵排序进行标识；随后训练轻量 LoRA 适配器在对应 key 上抑制原始 value，从而生成概率忘记痕迹；在黑/灰盒下聚合似然与语义证据形成指纹成功率进行验证

Result: 在多种架构和场景下 	extsc{ForgetMark} 在保持标准性能的前提下实现 100% 验证率，优于传统后门基线在隐蔽性、对模型合并的鲁棒性及增量微调后的稳健性

Conclusion: 忘记指纹框架 	extsc{ForgetMark} 可在保持模型性能的同时实现 100% 所有权验证并具有高度隐蔽性与鲁棒性

Abstract: Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/ForgetMark}{https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/ForgetMark}.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DnF利用域样式+语义级联触发，低困惑度、强鲁棒的黑盒LLM指纹，实用且隐蔽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型快速增长，现有基于后门的指纹依赖罕见词或固定触发-响应映射，导致高困惑度输入易被过滤、鲁棒性差；亟需一种低困惑度、难以检测且持续有效的IP保护方案。

Method: 通过双层嵌套指纹——将领域特定写作风格线索与隐式语义触发器耦合，形成分层后门；只需在输入中加入低困惑度触发，便可激活指纹。

Result: 在Mistral-7B、LLaMA-3‑8B‑Instruct和Falcon3‑7B‑Instruct上均实现完美指纹激活；触发低困惑度，模型在下游任务上的效能不受影响；对增量微调和模型合并保持鲁棒；在指纹检测攻击下保持不可检测。

Conclusion: DnF提供了一种可在黑盒环境下验证LLM所有权且不影响模型实用性的稳健且隐蔽的指纹技术。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对APT样本稀缺、精细标注成本高以及攻击手法多样化等实际部署难点，提出了新的检测框架。

Method: 采用无监督学习在节点层面进行异常检测，随后基于多视角特征构建多个子模型，并在协同学习框架下进行整合，以适配多种攻击场景。

Result: 在三大真实APT数据集上的实验表明，多视角特征提升了跨场景泛化能力，协同训练显著提高了在标签稀缺情况下的节点级检测性能。

Conclusion: APT-MCL能够在多样攻击环境下实现高效、可部署的APT检测，为实际防御提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are stealthy and multi-stage, making single-point defenses (e.g., malware- or traffic-based detectors) ill-suited to capture long-range and cross-entity attack semantics. Provenance-graph analysis has become a prominent approach for APT detection. However, its practical deployment is hampered by (i) the scarcity of APT samples, (ii) the cost and difficulty of fine-grained APT sample labeling, and (iii) the diversity of attack tactics and techniques. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposes APT-MCL, an intelligent APT detection system based on Multi-view Collaborative provenance graph Learning. It adopts an unsupervised learning strategy to discover APT attacks at the node level via anomaly detection. After that, it creates multiple anomaly detection sub-models based on multi-view features and integrates them within a collaborative learning framework to adapt to diverse attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world APT datasets validate the approach: (i) multi-view features improve cross-scenario generalization, and (ii) co-training substantially boosts node-level detection under label scarcity, enabling practical deployment on diverse attack scenarios.

*Shuiyin Liu,Amin Sakzad*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出的最大环面距离码通过最大 L2 距离降低解密失败率，维度越高收益越显著，整体性能优于当前最优方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为 post‑quantum 密码（如 NIST 选题 Kyber）降低解密失败率而设计更鲁棒的编码方案。

Method: 把编码视为在离散 ℓ 维环面 $\mathbb{Z}_q^\ell$ 上选取 $2^\ell$ 个点，并采用 $D_4$（ℓ=4）和 $2E_8$（ℓ=8）格构造，以实现最大的傅立叶距离；ℓ=2 时退化为 Minal 的变体。

Result: 数值实验表明：在 ℓ>2 时，MTD 码在 DFR 上优于 Minal 与 Lee‑距离代码；在 ℓ=2 时，性能相当。

Conclusion: 在格基公钥加密中，MTD 码通过最大化最小 L2 余弦距离显著降低了解密失败率，尤其在高维时优于现有 Minal 与 Lee 距离代码。

Abstract: We propose a maximum toroidal distance (MTD) code for lattice-based public-key encryption (PKE). By formulating the encryption encoding problem as the selection of $2^\ell$ points in the discrete $\ell$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{Z}_q^\ell$, the proposed construction maximizes the minimum $L_2$-norm toroidal distance to reduce the decryption failure rate (DFR) in post-quantum schemes such as the NIST ML-KEM (Crystals-Kyber). For $\ell = 2$, we show that the MTD code is essentially a variant of the Minal code recently introduced at IACR CHES 2025. For $\ell = 4$, we present a construction based on the $D_4$ lattice that achieves the largest known toroidal distance, while for $\ell = 8$, the MTD code corresponds to $2E_8$ lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}_4^8$. Numerical evaluations under the Kyber setting show that the proposed codes outperform both Minal and maximum Lee-distance ($L_1$-norm) codes in DFR for $\ell > 2$, while matching Minal code performance for $\ell = 2$.

Abstract: This paper explores a new cyber-attack vector targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICS), particularly focusing on water treatment facilities. Developing a new multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, adversaries craft stealthy, strategically timed, wear-out attacks designed to subtly degrade product quality and reduce the lifespan of field actuators. This sophisticated method leverages DRL methodology not only to execute precise and detrimental impacts on targeted infrastructure but also to evade detection by contemporary AI-driven defence systems. By developing and implementing tailored policies, the attackers ensure their hostile actions blend seamlessly with normal operational patterns, circumventing integrated security measures. Our research reveals the robustness of this attack strategy, shedding light on the potential for DRL models to be manipulated for adversarial purposes. Our research has been validated through testing and analysis in an industry-level setup. For reproducibility and further study, all related materials, including datasets and documentation, are publicly accessible.

*Yongtong Gu,Songze Li,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Propose MASH, a three‑step style‑based approach to fool black‑box AI‑text detectors, achieving 92% success and improving over baselines by ~24% while keeping quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misuse of AI-generated texts has risen; detectors need to be evaded; existing attacks rely on white-box or expensive black-box methods.

Method: A multi-stage framework (MASH) using style-injection supervised fine‑tuning, direct preference optimization, and inference‑time refinement to make texts appear human‑written.

Result: Averaged ASR 92% across six datasets and five detectors, 24% higher than the strongest baseline. Maintains superior linguistic quality.

Conclusion: MASH can successfully evade black‑box detectors more effectively than prior methods while preserving linguistic quality.

Abstract: The increasing misuse of AI-generated texts (AIGT) has motivated the rapid development of AIGT detection methods. However, the reliability of these detectors remains fragile against adversarial evasions. Existing attack strategies often rely on white-box assumptions or demand prohibitively high computational and interaction costs, rendering them ineffective under practical black-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Alignment for Style Humanization (MASH), a novel framework that evades black-box detectors based on style transfer. MASH sequentially employs style-injection supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and inference-time refinement to shape the distributions of AI-generated texts to resemble those of human-written texts. Experiments across 6 datasets and 5 detectors demonstrate the superior performance of MASH over 11 baseline evaders. Specifically, MASH achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 92%, surpassing the strongest baselines by an average of 24%, while maintaining superior linguistic quality.

Conclusion: 本文通过给出RR的精确最大似然估计的简单公式，直接替代了慢速的迭代贝叶斯更新算法，并对比了多种估计方法，提供了实用的选择建议。

Abstract: Randomized Response (RR) is a protocol designed to collect and analyze categorical data with local differential privacy guarantees. It has been used as a building block of mechanisms deployed by Big tech companies to collect app or web users' data. Each user reports an automatic random alteration of their true value to the analytics server, which then estimates the histogram of the true unseen values of all users using a debiasing rule to compensate for the added randomness. A known issue is that the standard debiasing rule can yield a vector with negative values (which can not be interpreted as a histogram), and there is no consensus on the best fix. An elegant but slow solution is the Iterative Bayesian Update algorithm (IBU), which converges to the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) as the number of iterations goes to infinity. This paper bypasses IBU by providing a simple formula for the exact MLE of RR and compares it with other estimation methods experimentally to help practitioners decide which one to use.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs), which support services such as driving assistants and medical diagnoses, undergo lengthy and expensive training procedures. Therefore, the training's outcome - the DNN weights - represents a significant intellectual property asset to protect. Side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently appeared as an effective approach to recover this confidential asset from DNN implementations. In response, researchers have proposed to defend DNN implementations through classic side-channel countermeasures, at the cost of higher energy consumption, inference time, and resource utilisation. Following a different approach, Ding et al. (HOST'25) introduced MACPRUNING, a novel SCA countermeasure based on pruning, a performance-oriented Approximate Computing technique: at inference time, the implementation randomly prunes (or skips) non-important weights (i.e., with low contribution to the DNN's accuracy) of the first layer, exponentially increasing the side-channel resilience of the protected DNN implementation. However, the original security analysis of MACPRUNING did not consider a control-flow dependency intrinsic to the countermeasure design. This dependency may allow an attacker to circumvent MACPRUNING and recover the weights important to the DNN's accuracy. This paper describes a preprocessing methodology to exploit the above-mentioned control-flow dependency. Through practical experiments on a Chipwhisperer-Lite running a MACPRUNING-protected Multi-Layer Perceptron, we target the first 8 weights of each neuron and recover 96% of the important weights, demonstrating the drastic reduction in security of the protected implementation. Moreover, we show how microarchitectural leakage improves the effectiveness of our methodology, even allowing for the recovery of up to 100% of the targeted non-important weights. Lastly, by adapting our methodology [continue in pdf].

Abstract: This study independently reproduces the malware detection methodology presented by Felli cious et al.

We utilized the original public dataset (250,533 training samples, 83,511 test samples) and replicated four model variants: Unigram, Bigram, Trigram, and Combined n gram approaches. Our reproduction successfully validated all key findings, achieving F1-scores that exceeded the original results by 0.99% to 2.57% across all models at the optimal API call length of 2,500. The Unigram model achieved F1=0.8717 (original: 0.8631), confirming its ef fectiveness as a lightweight malware detector. Across three independent experimental runs with different random seeds, we observed remarkably consistent results with standard deviations be low 0.5%, demonstrating high reproducibility. This study validates the robustness and scientific rigor of the original methodology while confirming the practical viability of frequency-based API call analysis for malware detection.

TL;DR: 利用内存重排实现无计时侧信道，证实多种处理器易受攻击，已实现高速信道和指纹识别，未来可进一步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行单元普遍采用宽松内存模型，导致内存操作可乱序执行，这在多核活跃时更易触发硬件优化，因此可能成为跨进程侧信道的一种可靠手段。

Method: 1) 对多种CPU/GPU进行模糊测试，观察跨进程内存重排序；2) 设计Memory DisOrder侧信道，对其进行实验性利用，包括隐藏通道与指纹识别；3) 通过运用硬件优化细节提升重排序率，探讨更高速通道潜力。

Result: 对X86/Arm/Apple CPU、NVIDIA/AMD/Apple GPU等主流芯片均发现易受攻击；在Apple M3 GPU实现16 bits/s的机密信道，95%准确率；在多CPU和Apple M3 GPU实现DNN架构指纹识别；通过细节优化，X86 CPU实现可达30K bits/s的机密通道。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了利用内存重排序的无计时侧信道攻击，证明了多种主流处理器易受此漏洞影响，能够实现高速机密信道和应用指纹识别，并指出通过低层系统细节可进一步提升攻击速率。

Abstract: To improve efficiency, nearly all parallel processing units (CPUs and GPUs) implement relaxed memory models in which memory operations may be re-ordered, i.e., executed out-of-order. Prior testing work in this area found that memory re-orderings are observed more frequently when other cores are active, e.g., stressing the memory system, which likely triggers aggressive hardware optimizations.
  In this work, we present Memory DisOrder: a timerless side-channel that uses memory re-orderings to infer activity on other processes. We first perform a fuzzing campaign and show that many mainstream processors (X86/Arm/Apple CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD/Apple GPUs) are susceptible to cross-process signals. We then show how the vulnerability can be used to implement classic attacks, including a covert channel, achieving up to 16 bits/second with 95% accuracy on an Apple M3 GPU, and application fingerprinting, achieving reliable closed-world DNN architecture fingerprinting on several CPUs and an Apple M3 GPU. Finally, we explore how low-level system details can be exploited to increase re-orderings, showing the potential for a covert channel to achieve nearly 30K bits/second on X86 CPUs. More precise attacks can likely be developed as the vulnerability becomes better understood.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for estimating parameters that form a general model for human pilot response for specific tasks. The human model is essential for the dynamic analysis of piloted vehicles. Data are generated on a simulator with multiple trials being incorporated to find the single model that best describes the data. The model is found entirely in the time domain by constructing a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem implicitly represents the state of the underlying system, making it robust to natural variation in human responses. It is demonstrated by estimating the human response model for a position control task with a quadcopter drone.

Motivation: 传统的通信噪声被视为扰动，本文将其视为增加隐私性的因素，探讨如何利用现有噪声实现多智能体系统的差分隐私控制。

Method: 基于线性二次调节器（LQR）的控制框架，通信噪声的方差随相邻智能体状态差异而变化，无需额外隐私噪声即实现控制。

Conclusion: 内在通信噪声既能满足隐私需求，又能保证多智能体形成与跟踪的性能，无需人工添加噪声。

Abstract: This paper investigates privacy-preserving distributed cooperative control for multi-agent systems within the framework of differential privacy. In cooperative control, communication noise is inevitable and is usually regarded as a disturbance that impairs coordination. This work revisits such noise as a potential privacy-enhancing factor. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based framework is proposed for agents communicating over noisy channels, \textcolor{black}{where the noise variance depends on the relative state differences between neighbouring agents.} The resulting controller achieves formation while protecting the reference signals from inference attacks. It is analytically proven that the inherent communication noise can guarantee bounded $(ε,δ)$-differential privacy without adding dedicated privacy noise, while the \textcolor{black}{system cooperative tracking error} remains bounded and convergent in both the mean-square and almost-sure sense.

Abstract: We unify Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability and Reinforcement Learning (RL) through a proposed running cost formulation. We prove that the resultant travel-cost value function is the unique bounded viscosity solution of a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman (HJB) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with zero terminal data, whose negative sublevel set equals the strict backward-reachable tube. Using a forward reparameterization and a contraction inducing Bellman update, we show that fixed points of small-step RL value iteration converge to the viscosity solution of the forward discounted HJB. Experiments on a classical benchmark compare learned values to semi-Lagrangian HJB ground truth and quantify error.

Abstract: The AI datacenters are currently being deployed on a large scale to support the training and deployment of power-intensive large-language models (LLMs). Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs. Using real Azure inference traces and detailed GPU profiling, our model balances serving latency and thermal constraints in AI datacenters while significantly improving AI datacenters' energy efficiency.

Abstract: Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs) are fundamental to control system design but are notoriously difficult to solve due to their nonconvexity. This study addresses BMI-based control optimization problems by adapting and integrating advanced evolutionary strategies. Specifically, a memetic Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (memetic CMA-ES) is proposed, which incorporates a local refinement phase via a (1+1)-CMA-ES within the global search process. While these algorithmic components are established in evolutionary computing, their tailored integration and specific tuning for control design tasks represent a novel application in this context. Experimental evaluations on $H_{\infty}$ controller synthesis and spectral abscissa optimization demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing BMI solvers in terms of both solution quality and robustness. This work bridges the gap between evolutionary computation and control theory, providing a practical and effective approach to tackling challenging BMI-constrained problems.

Abstract: The exploitation of mineral resources in plateau regions is confronted with critical challenges including low blasting efficiency, excessive energy consumption,and compromised operational safety when dealing with low-temperature water-bearing frozen rock masses.This study systematically investigates the dynamic-static mechanical properties,deformation-fracture behaviors,and energy consumption characteristics of plateau frozen sandstone under the coupled effects of temperature and moisture content (5%-15%).The research methodology integrates field sampling, low-pressure low-temperature simulation tests, graded impact loading tests, and numerical inversion analysis. Results demonstrate that freezing significantly enhances the dynamic strength and brittleness of saturated sandstone.The pore structure undergoes substantial evolution with decreasing temperature, with the porosity increasing by 63.15%.Based on PFC3D microscopic simulations, the mechanism of frost heave damage and the regulatory effect of water-ice phase transition on rock mechanical behaviors are elucidated.A quantitative analysis method for energy dissipation is proposed, revealing that the energy absorption increment of frozen rocks is higher than that of room-temperature samples.The findings provide a theoretical basis and technical support for optimizing blasting parameters, realizing directional energy release,and promoting green construction of frozen rock masses in high-altitude areas.

Abstract: Selecting a few available actuators to ensure the controllability of a linear system is a fundamental problem in control theory. Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search.

Abstract: In the 21st century, transitioning to renewable energy sources is imperative, with fossil fuel reserves depleting rapidly and recognizing critical environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Embracing renewable energy is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic move with multiple benefits. By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information. Our results demonstrate lower transaction time by 41\% and energy consumption by 65\% compared to proof-of-stake.

Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven h2 model reduction method for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we solve the h2 model reduction problem defined over a finite horizon using only impulse response data. Furthermore, we show that the proposed data-driven algorithm converges to a stationary point under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method constructs a good reduced-order model in terms of the h2 norm defined over the finite horizon using a SLICOT benchmark (the CD player model).

Abstract: Residential users in demand response programs must balance electricity costs and user dissatisfaction under real-time pricing. This study proposes a multiobjective model predictive control approach for home energy management systems with battery storage, aiming to minimize both objectives while mitigating uncertainties. Laguerre functions parameterize control signals, transforming the optimization problem into one with linear inequalities for efficient exploration. A constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, incorporating convex sampler-based crossover and mutation, is developed to ensure feasible solutions. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, limiting cost increases to 0.52\% under uncertainties, compared to at least 2.3\% with other methods.

Abstract: A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.

Abstract: Roll-to-roll slot die coating is a widely used industrial manufacturing technique applied in a diverse range of applications such as the production of lithium-ion batteries, solar cells and optical films. The efficiency of roll-to-roll slot die coating depends on the precise control of various input parameters such as pump rate, substrate velocity and coating gap. However, these inputs are sensitive to disturbances in process conditions, leading to inconsistencies in the various characteristics of the produced film. To address this challenge, a \gls{DO} is utilized for detecting disturbances, which may occur in the same or different channels as the control signal within the system. A generalized compensator is then implemented to mitigate the impact of these disturbances on the output, thereby enhancing uncertainty suppression. Additionally, integrating the disturbance rejection system with an output tracking controller enables the coating system to maintain the desired thickness under varying input conditions and disturbances. The effectiveness of this approach is then validated using a test rig equipped with a camera system, which facilitates the development of a data-driven model of the dynamic process, represented by state-space equations. The simulation results were demonstrated to showcase the effectiveness of the DOBOTC system, which provides a resilient solution for the output tracking issue in a data-driven model with generalized disturbances.
