### [1] [Data-Based Analysis of Relative Degree and Zero Dynamics in Linear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05395)
*Janina Schaa,Thomas Berger*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 利用观测数据评估系统相对阶和零动态稳定性，无需显式模型识别，直接支持控制策略选取与连续系统复原。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型基控制在模型不准或复杂时效果不佳；现有数据驱动控制多聚焦于直接构造控制器，缺乏对系统基本性质的评估。本文旨在利用数据评估系统基础属性，以指导控制方案的选择。

Method: 使用观测数据形成的数据驱动判定条件，判定相对阶与零动态的稳定性；随后通过在三个不同采样时刻以零阶保持方式获得离散化模型，并将其合并重构连续系统；这些判断与重构过程可直接转化为算法实现。

Result: 给出了在离散时间线性系统条件下可直接应用于观测数据的判定算法，涵盖相对阶、零动态稳定性评估以及连续系统重构，并可以与实际数据集无缝结合。

Conclusion: 本文通过基于数据的条件，表征离散线性系统（单/多输入/输出）的相对阶和零动态稳定性，并演示如何利用三次零阶保持采样重构连续系统，以便在无显式模型识别的前提下选择合适的控制策略。

Abstract: Data-driven control offers a powerful alternative to traditional model-based methods, particularly when accurate system models are unavailable or prohibitively complex. While existing data-driven control methods primarily aim to construct controllers directly from measured data, our approach uses the available data to assess fundamental system-theoretic properties. This allows the informed selection of suitable control strategies without explicit model identification. We provide data-based conditions characterizing the (vector) relative degree and the stability of the zero dynamics, which are critical for ensuring proper performance of modern controllers. Our results cover both single- and multi-input/output settings of discrete-time linear systems. We further show how a continuous-time system can be reconstructed from three sampling discretizations obtained via Zero-order Hold at suitable sampling times, thus allowing the extension of the results to the combined data collected from these discretizations. All results can be applied directly to observed data sets using the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flying (EMFF) is challenging due to the complex coupling between the electromagnetic fields generated by each satellite in the formation. To address this challenge, this article uses alternating magnetic field forces (AMFF) to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled to achieve desired forces between each pair of satellites. The main contribution of this article is a 3-satellite experimental demonstration of decentralized closed-loop EMFF using AMFF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of AMFF with at least 3 satellites in open or closed loop. This is noteworthy because the coupling challenges of EMFF are only present with more than 2 satellites, and thus, a formation of at least 3 is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of AMFF. The experiments are conducted on a ground-based testbed consisting of 3 electromagnetically actuated satellites on linear air tracks. The closed-loop experimental results are compared with behavior from numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.

Conclusion: SIaD-Tool可准确、可扩展地评估现代电力系统的频域稳定性与交互；

Abstract: This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for analysis of generalized homogeneous control systems under state quantization. In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.

Motivation: 提升可再生能源社区内本地能源交换价值需鼓励终端用户的可灵活能源消费；传统集中式规划在数据隐私、公平分配方面存忧，且常采用bi‑level、ADMM等方法面临计算复杂、凸性难题。

Method: 构建了一个基于迭代的分散可调节规划框架，社区运营商作为协调者根据全局需求发出向上/向下灵活性请求，成员以可调节容量报价回应；通过逐步迭代实现个体最优且收敛至全局最优。

Result: 在20户住宅案例验证中，分散与集中协调方案在联合账单方面差距不超过3.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了个体最优与全局最优的近似兼顾，使分布式可调节资源规划在不降低经济效益的前提下有效降低计算复杂度与隐私顾虑。

Abstract: Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.

Further, parametric dynamic behavior is computed for the model as steady states with local stability with respect to its control inputs, elevator and fuel-equivalence ratio in four different cases using a numerical continuation algorithm. Detailed analysis of the qualitative longitudinal dynamics of the model is carried out based on bifurcation theory methodology. Numerical simulation results are presented to verify bifurcation analysis results.

Abstract: Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be critical for time-sensitive data collection missions, yet existing research often relies on simulations that fail to capture real-world complexities. Many studies assume ideal wireless conditions or focus only on path planning, neglecting the challenge of making real-time decisions in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we address the problem of adaptive sensor selection for a data-gathering UAV, considering both the buffered data at each sensor and realistic propagation conditions. We introduce the Hover-based Greedy Adaptive Download (HGAD) strategy, designed to maximize data transfer by intelligently hovering over sensors during periods of peak signal quality. We validate HGAD using both a digital twin (DT) and a real-world (RW) testbed at the NSF-funded AERPAW platform. Our experiments show that HGAD significantly improves download stability and successfully meets per-sensor data targets. When compared with the traditional Greedy approach that simply follows the strongest signal, HGAD is shown to outperform in the cumulative data download. This work demonstrates the importance of integrating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware and buffer-aware scheduling with DT and RW signal traces to design resilient UAV data-mule strategies for realistic deployments.

Abstract: In recent years, the security vulnerabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a serious concern in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) research. These highly intelligent models, capable of performing multi-modal tasks with high accuracy, are also severely susceptible to carefully launched security attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, which can manipulate model behavior and bypass safety constraints. This paper introduces MJAD-MLLMs, a holistic framework that systematically analyzes the proposed Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks and multi-LLM-based defense techniques for MLLMs. In this paper, we make three original contributions. First, we introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack to exploit the vulnerabilities of the MLLMs under multi-turn prompting. Second, we propose a novel fragment-optimized and multi-LLM defense mechanism, called FragGuard, to effectively mitigate jailbreaking attacks in the MLLMs. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks and defenses through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source MLLMs and benchmark datasets, and compare their performance with the existing techniques.

TL;DR: Mastermind是一个动态自我完善的多轮攻击框架，通过闭环规划和知识库提升，可在对话中持续发现并利用LLM漏洞，实际实验表明其效果优于传统方法并具备防御鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM面临多轮黑客攻击，现有攻击缺乏长周期连贯性、依赖固定模式、对模型动态状态不适应。需要一种能够持续学习、动态调整的攻击方法。

Method: 采用自闭环规划、执行与反思的动态自我提升框架；通过分层规划把高层目标与低层攻击步骤解耦；利用知识库自主发现并精炼攻击模式，并动态重组攻击向量。

Result: 在GPT‑5、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等最新模型上实验，Mastermind在攻击成功率和有害性评分上显著优于基线，并能有效对抗多种先进防御。

Conclusion: Mastermind在多轮脚本破解攻击中显著优于现有方法，具有更高的成功率与适应性，并能抵抗多种高级防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant threat from multi-turn jailbreak attacks, where adversaries progressively steer conversations to elicit harmful outputs. However, the practical effectiveness of existing attacks is undermined by several critical limitations: they struggle to maintain a coherent progression over long interactions, often losing track of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done; they rely on rigid or pre-defined patterns, and fail to adapt to the LLM's dynamic and unpredictable conversational state. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings. Moreover, our framework exhibits notable resilience against multiple advanced defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了当今LLM安全防护机制的严重漏洞，强调了更稳健防御策略的迫切需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, however, they remain critically vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful responses violating human values and safety guidelines. Despite extensive research on defense mechanisms, existing safeguards prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial strategies. In this work, we propose iMIST (\underline{i}nteractive \underline{M}ulti-step \underline{P}rogre\underline{s}sive \underline{T}ool-disguised Jailbreak Attack), a novel adaptive jailbreak method that synergistically exploits vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. iMIST disguises malicious queries as normal tool invocations to bypass content filters, while simultaneously introducing an interactive progressive optimization algorithm that dynamically escalates response harmfulness through multi-turn dialogues guided by real-time harmfulness assessment. Our experiments on widely-used models demonstrate that iMIST achieves higher attack effectiveness, while maintaining low rejection rates. These results reveal critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that ensures transparency, security, and immutability through cryptographic techniques. However, advancements in quantum computing threaten the security of classical cryptographic schemes, jeopardizing blockchain integrity once cryptographic quantum supremacy is achieved. This milestone, defined here as the realization of quantum computers to solve practical cryptographic problems, would render existing security standards vulnerable, exposing blockchain assets (currency, data, etc.) to fraud and theft. To address this risk, we propose and implement a smart contract deployable on the Ethereum blockchain, having the ability to run applications on its blockchain, that generates classically intractable puzzles by probabilistically generating large, hard-to-factor numbers without requiring secret information. This contract then serves two purposes: to establish a mechanism (1) for a trustless, unbiased proof of cryptographic quantum supremacy by verifying solutions to these puzzles, and (2) to protect user funds on Ethereum by triggering quantum-secure fallback protocols upon detecting cryptographic quantum supremacy, since it is desirable to wait as long as possible to fall back to a quantum-secure scheme because of its inherent additional cost and complexity. These mechanisms demonstrate the ability to identify cryptographic vulnerabilities and ensure a smooth transition to quantum-secure standards, safeguarding blockchain assets in a post-quantum era.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型（LM）基于的软件漏洞检测易受词汇和语法扰动的对抗攻击，导致关键缺陷逃避检测。现有黑盒攻击主要依赖单一扰动策略，限制了高效探索对抗代码空间。

Method: 我们提出HogVul——一个黑盒对抗代码生成框架，采用粒子群优化（PSO）的双通道统一优化策略，将词汇层和语法层扰动整合，系统化地协调两层扰动以扩大对抗样本搜索空间。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，HogVul平均攻击成功率比现有最佳基线提高了26.05%。

Conclusion: 混合优化策略在揭示语言模型漏洞方面具有显著潜力，能够显著提升攻击效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in software vulnerability detection have been driven by Language Model (LM)-based approaches. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit lexical and syntax perturbations, allowing critical flaws to evade detection. Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in exposing model vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: 本文首次探索基于实体加密的数据持续预训练框架，为隐私保护型LLM提供可行方案，但确定性加密的安全性仍需进一步评估。

Abstract: Preserving privacy in sensitive data while pretraining large language models on small, domain-specific corpora presents a significant challenge. In this work, we take an exploratory step toward privacy-preserving continual pretraining by proposing an entity-based framework that synthesizes encrypted training data to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts. We discuss the security implications and limitations of deterministic encryption, positioning this work as an initial investigation into the design space of encrypted data pretraining for privacy-preserving LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataArcTech/SoE.

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new generation of powerful chatbots that can be developed at relatively low cost. As companies deploy these tools, security challenges need to be addressed to prevent financial loss and reputational damage. A key security challenge is jailbreaking, the malicious manipulation of prompts and inputs to bypass a chatbot's safety guardrails. Multi-turn attacks are a relatively new form of jailbreaking involving a carefully crafted chain of interactions with a chatbot. We introduce Echo Chamber, a new multi-turn attack using a gradual escalation method. We describe this attack in detail, compare it to other multi-turn attacks, and demonstrate its performance against multiple state-of-the-art models through extensive evaluation.

TL;DR: 融合高分辨率3D扫描与深度摄像的非刚性配准+物理光学散射仿真方法，比传统深度序列模型更鲁棒，能在低信噪条件下重现雷达观测，提升对雷达测量变化的解释力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 呼吸等生命体征导致人体表面出现非刚性形变，传统雷达模型基于简化运动假设，易受形变影响导致测量误差和鲁棒性下降，需要更精准、更物理合理的表面形变感知方法。

Method: 首先使用相干点漂移算法将静态模板与动态深度帧实现非刚性配准，获取随时间变化的人体表面几何模型；随后在每帧上采用物理光学近似计算电磁散射，重构中频雷达信号，实现雷达观测的物理仿真。

Result: 在两位受试者上，模型与实验测得位移波形的相关系数分别为0.943与0.887，高于仅用深度序列模型的0.868和0.796；单一相对固定反射点情况下亦达到0.789 的相位幅值相关系数。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种融合静态高分辨率三维扫描与时间深度摄像数据的表面形变感知雷达观测模型，显著提升了在低信噪、复杂表面动态以及多反射点场景下的测量鲁棒性，模型与实测间的皮尔逊相关系数高达0.943和0.887。

Abstract: Non-contact radar-based human sensing is often interpreted using simplified motion assumptions. However, respiration induces non-rigid surface deformation of the human body that impacts electromagnetic wave scattering and can degrade the robustness of measurements. To address this, we propose a surface-deformation-aware observation model for radar-based human sensing that fuses static high-resolution three-dimensional scanner measurements with temporal depth camera data to represent time-varying human surface geometry. Non-rigid registration using the coherent point drift algorithm is employed to align a static template with dynamic depth frames. Frame-wise electromagnetic scattering is subsequently computed using the physical optics approximation, allowing the reconstruction of intermediate-frequency radar signals that emulate radar observations. Validation against experimental radar data demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited greater robustness than a depth-sequence-only model under low-signal-quality conditions involving complex surface dynamics and multiple reflective sites. For two participants, the proposed model achieved higher Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.943 and 0.887 between model-derived and experimentally measured displacement waveforms, compared with 0.868 and 0.796 for the depth-sequence-only model. Furthermore, in a favorable case characterized by a single relatively-stationary reflective site, the proposed method achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.789 between model-derived and experimentally measured in-phase-quadrature magnitude variations. These results suggest that our sensor-fusion-based deformation-aware observation modeling can realistically reproduce radar observations and provide physically grounded insights into the interpretation of radar measurement variations.

TL;DR: 迁移学习 + 低采样率PPG 促进可穿戴SpO2监测低功耗化并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SpO2估计方法依赖复杂临床校准，难以适用于低功耗可穿戴设备。

Method: 基于迁移学习的框架：先在公开临床数据集上预训练自注意力BiLSTM，然后用我们的可穿戴设备（25Hz双通道PPG）和FDA批准的参考脉搏血氧仪收集的数据进行微调。

Result: 在公开数据集和私有数据集上，平均绝对误差分别为2.967%和2.624%，显著优于传统校准及非迁移机器学习基线；使用25Hz PPG相较100Hz可降低40%的功耗。即时SpO2预测MAE为3.284%，能够捕捉快速波动。

Conclusion: 实现了无需临床校准，快速适配、低功耗的高精度SpO2监测。

Abstract: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a vital marker for healthcare monitoring. Traditional SpO2 estimation methods often rely on complex clinical calibration, making them unsuitable for low-power, wearable applications. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based framework for the rapid adaptation of SpO2 estimation to energy-efficient wearable devices using low-sampling-rate (25Hz) dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG). We first pretrain a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model with self-attention on a public clinical dataset, then fine-tune it using data collected from our wearable We-Be band and an FDA-approved reference pulse oximeter. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.967% on the public dataset and 2.624% on the private dataset, significantly outperforming traditional calibration and non-transferred machine learning baselines. Moreover, using 25Hz PPG reduces power consumption by 40% compared to 100Hz, excluding baseline draw. Our method also attains an MAE of 3.284% in instantaneous SpO2 prediction, effectively capturing rapid fluctuations. These results demonstrate the rapid adaptation of accurate, low-power SpO2 monitoring on wearable devices without the need for clinical calibration.

Motivation: 实现准确、可泛化的血压估计，对心血管疾病的早期发现和管理至关重要。需要解决传统单一光谱或单通道模型及受试者偏差导致的泛化不足问题。

Method: 采用课程学习与领域对抗训练相结合的策略：先将任务从高血压分类学习转向连续血压回归，并通过对抗模块抑制受试者身份信息，提取可迁移特征；同时利用多通道融合提升感知信息。

Result: 在四波长PPG数据集上，实验得到平均绝对误差（MAE）为SBP 14.2 mmHg、DBP 6.4 mmHg；多通道融合优于单通道；消融实验表明课程学习和对抗训练两项均显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 论文证明了基于课程对抗学习的多波长光电容积描记（PPG）血压估计框架能够在严格的受试者级拆分下实现准确、可泛化的血压预测，说明此方法在临床血压监测中的应用前景。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable blood pressure (BP) estimation is vital for the early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we enforce subject-level data splitting on a public multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) dataset and propose a generalizable BP estimation framework based on curriculum-adversarial learning. Our approach combines curriculum learning, which transitions from hypertension classification to BP regression, with domain-adversarial training that confuses subject identity to encourage the learning of subject-invariant features. Experiments show that multi-channel fusion consistently outperforms single-channel models. On the four-wavelength PPG dataset, our method achieves strong performance under strict subject-level splitting, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 14.2mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.4mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the curriculum and adversarial components. These results highlight the potential of leveraging complementary information in multi-wavelength PPG and curriculum-adversarial strategies for accurate and robust BP estimation.

<details>

Motivation: 正式化递归自训练在大型语言模型中的动态行为，揭示自生数据对模型质量的危险影响。

Method: 将递归自训练视作离散时间动力系统，分析了自生成数据导致的熵衰减与方差放大两种失败模式，并引入了基于算法概率的符号回归与程序合成（CTM）来逃离数据处理不等式。

Result: 证明了系统会不可避免地出现熵衰减和方差放大，并展示了强化学习在不完善验证器下同样会出现语义崩溃。

Conclusion: 纯分布式学习导致模型崩溃，而混合神经符号方法提供了持续自我提升的框架。

Abstract: We formalise recursive self-training in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI as a discrete-time dynamical system and prove that, as training data become increasingly self-generated ($α_t \to 0$), the system undergoes inevitably degenerative dynamics. We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of multi-user covert communications over a fixed bandwidth in a multi-cell scenario with both eavesdroppers and malicious jammers. We propose an intelligent spectrum control (ISC) scheme that combines high-accuracy spectrum sensing with AI-assisted real-time decision-making to generate time-frequency dynamic occupation patterns for multiple legitimate users. The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints. Simulation results confirm the tight match between the analytical and Monte Carlo curves, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher DEP, a larger RTP, and a greater multi-user capacity than the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: With the increasing threat posed by modulation classification to wireless security, this paper proposes a secure communication framework based on modulation order confusion (MOC), which intentionally disguises the original modulation as a higher- or lower-order one to mislead eavesdroppers. For single-antenna systems, two schemes are developed: symbol random mapping and symbol time diversity, enabling modulation order confusion with customized receivers. For multi-antenna systems, receiver-transparent MOC schemes are proposed, including series-expansion-based and constellation-path-based signal designs, and are further extended to RIS-assisted systems with joint beamformer and RIS reflection design. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes effectively defeat both deep-learning-based and expert-knowledge-based modulation classifiers without degrading communication performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore new connections between the cycles in the graph of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix. The resulting observations are used to derive fast, simple, recursive formulas for the number of cycles $N_{2k}$ of length $2k$, $k<g$, in a bi-regular graph of girth $g$. Moreover, we derive explicit formulas for $N_{2k}$, $k\leq 7$, in terms of the nonzero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. Throughout, we focus on the practically interesting class of bi-regular quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes, for which the eigenvalues can be obtained efficiently by applying techniques used for block-circulant matrices.

Motivation: 研究在完全失去顺序的情况下，仅通过删除符号来产生错误的长度为n的多集错误纠正码，以模拟置换通道。

Method: 在极限删除区域（输出长度k=n-t）下，使用严谨/近似下限来确定最大码大小，并采用递归puncturing上界、构造性同余式构造和循环Sidon型线性构造。

Result: 为t=n-1、t=n-2给出精确最优码大小；t=n-3进行细化分析；开发一般递归puncturing上界；在二进制多集模型下确定所有t≥1的S₂(n,t)和显式最优构造；提供q-ary单删码通用构造，并展示q≥3时自然同余构造可能不最优；给出基于单一同余约束的通用循环Sidon型线性构造，冗余量为log_q(t(t+1)^{q-2}+1)，编码/解码复杂度为O(n)。

Conclusion: 本文在极限删除情形下阐明了多集错误纠正码的极限表现，并提供了一系列精确上限、最优构造与可实现线性复杂度算法，深化了对置换通道错误纠正的理论认识。

Abstract: We study error-correcting codes in the space $\mathcal{S}_{n,q}$ of length-$n$ multisets over a $q$-ary alphabet, motivated by permutation channels in which ordering is completely lost and errors act solely by deletions of symbols, i.e., by reducing symbol multiplicities.
  Our focus is on the \emph{extremal deletion regime}, where the channel output contains $k=n-t$ symbols. In this regime, we establish tight or near-tight bounds on the maximum code size. In particular, we determine the exact optimal code sizes for $t=n-1$ and for $t=n-2$, develop a refined analysis for $t=n-3$, and derive a general recursive puncturing upper bound for $t=n-k$ via a reduction from parameters $(n,k)$ to $(n-1,k-1)$.
  On the constructive side, we completely resolve the binary multiset model: for all $t\ge1$ we determine $S_2(n,t)$ exactly and give an explicit optimal congruence-based construction. We then study single-deletion codes beyond the binary case, presenting general $q$-ary constructions and showing, via explicit small-parameter examples, that the natural modular construction need not be optimal for $q\ge3$. Finally, we present an explicit cyclic Sidon-type linear construction for general $(q,t)$ based on a single congruence constraint, with redundancy $\log_q\!\bigl(t(t+1)^{q-2}+1\bigr)$ and encoding and decoding complexity linear in the blocklength $n$.

Abstract: A new shaping technique called coset shaping for coded QAM and PAM signaling is introduced and analyzed. This technique can be applied not only to information bits but also to parity bits without incurring additional complexity costs. It is proven that as the length of the error-correcting code and the modulation order tend to infinity, the gap to capacity for the proposed shaping scheme can be made arbitrarily small. Numerical results and comparisons for the shaping scheme, along with nonbinary LDPC-coded QAM signaling, are presented.

Abstract: Modern wireless systems are envisioned to employ antenna architectures that not only transmit and receive electromagnetic (EM) waves, but also intentionally reflect and possibly transform incident EM waves. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous framework grounded in Maxwell's equations for analyzing the complexity of EM far-field modeling of general antenna architectures. We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters. Furthermore, we construct a sequence of finite-rank operators whose approximation error decays super-exponentially once the operator rank exceeds an effective bandwidth associated with the antenna architecture and the analysis frequency. These results constitute a fundamental prerequisite for the efficient and accurate modeling of general antenna architectures on digital computing platforms.

Abstract: A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式计算中，既要降低通信负载（每个服务器需要的文件数量），又要平衡计算负载（每个工作器处理的子函数量），传统方法往往只能在两者间做权衡。

Method: 模型化为 d-均匀超图边划分问题，利用信息理论启发的互编剪子结构来设计文件和子函数分配方案，并提供上界与下界证明。

Result: IC 设计实现了通信成本达到 $n/N^{1/d}$ 的阶数最优，计算成本也同样最优，同时获得 $N^{1/d}$ 的分区增益，并在不同文件分布密度下保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 研究提出了 Interweaved-Cliques（IC）设计，能够在分布式计算中以确定性方式同时实现通信和计算成本的阶数最优，并且在不重新分配文件的情况下支持多种函数计算。

Abstract: We study the joint minimization of communication and computation costs in distributed computing, where a master node coordinates $N$ workers to evaluate a function over a library of $n$ files. Assuming that the function is decomposed into an arbitrary subfunction set $\mathbf{X}$, with each subfunction depending on $d$ input files, renders our distributed computing problem into a $d$-uniform hypergraph edge partitioning problem wherein the edge set (subfunction set), defined by $d$-wise dependencies between vertices (files) must be partitioned across $N$ disjoint groups (workers). The aim is to design a file and subfunction allocation, corresponding to a partition of $\mathbf{X}$, that minimizes the communication cost $π_{\mathbf{X}}$, representing the maximum number of distinct files per server, while also minimizing the computation cost $δ_{\mathbf{X}}$ corresponding to a maximal worker subfunction load. For a broad range of parameters, we propose a deterministic allocation solution, the \emph{Interweaved-Cliques (IC) design}, whose information-theoretic-inspired interweaved clique structure simultaneously achieves order-optimal communication and computation costs, for a large class of decompositions $\mathbf{X}$. This optimality is derived from our achievability and converse bounds, which reveal -- under reasonable assumptions on the density of $\mathbf{X}$ -- that the optimal scaling of the communication cost takes the form $n/N^{1/d}$, revealing that our design achieves the order-optimal \textit{partitioning gain} that scales as $N^{1/d}$, while also achieving an order-optimal computation cost. Interestingly, this order optimality is achieved in a deterministic manner, and very importantly, it is achieved blindly from $\mathbf{X}$, therefore enabling multiple desired functions to be computed without reshuffling files.

Abstract: As emerging applications demand higher throughput and lower latencies, operators are increasingly deploying millimeter-wave (mmWave) links within x-haul transport networks, spanning fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul segments. However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control.

Method: 采用端到端的token调度、优化数据结构消除中间缓冲以及智能激活检查点的共设计内核。

Result: 相较现有框架，MoEBlaze实现4倍以上速度提升，内存节省超过50%。

Conclusion: MoEBlaze在大型Mixture-of-Experts模型训练中显著提升了内存效率与性能。

Abstract: The pervasive "memory wall" bottleneck is significantly amplified in modern large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.

Result: 在4B至32B规模的模型上，TIME在TIMEBench上相较基准模型提升了思考和无思考模式的得分，且推理标记数量平均减少约10倍。

Conclusion: TIME通过加入时间标签、空隙计数和短的思考块，使大型语言模型能够在对话中进行上下文感知的短暂推理，显著提升了时序对齐性能，同时将推理标记令简化为十倍以内。

Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude. Our training data and code are available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and TIMEBench is available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench

Motivation: 传统神经符号系统难以在满足物理/逻辑约束时保持语义连贯，本文旨在通过拓扑信息指导梯度优化来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用 Forman‑Ricci 曲率捕获图拓扑，Deep Delta Learning 维持约束投影时的秩一扰动稳定性，并使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略（CMA‑ES）进行参数优化。

Result: 在多个规模的实验中，该方法将平均能量降至 1.15（相较基线 11.68），并在约束满足任务中取得 95% 成功率，具备种子无关收敛和良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文展示了一个神经符号推理框架，通过拓扑条件化和梯度稳定化，实现了在遵守物理与逻辑约束的同时保持语义一致性。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reasoning systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining semantic coherence while satisfying physical and logical constraints. Building upon our previous work on Ontology Neural Networks, we present an enhanced framework that integrates topological conditioning with gradient stabilization mechanisms. The approach employs Forman-Ricci curvature to capture graph topology, Deep Delta Learning for stable rank-one perturbations during constraint projection, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for parameter optimization. Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks. The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有公平性去偏方法要么需要修改客户端训练协议，要么聚合策略缺乏灵活性，难以满足实际分布式学习需求。

Method: 服务器在接收各客户端模型更新后生成单一校准更新，并将其与聚合后的更新结合以得到修正后的全局模型。

Result: 理论证明收敛性和公平性损失降低，实验结果表明EquFL显著减缓系统偏差。

Conclusion: EquFL在FL系统中通过服务器端的校准更新显著降低偏差并与FedAvg收敛到同样的最优全局模型。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian framework, but its performance depends critically on the choice of covariance kernel. Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning.

### [38] [Inverting Non-Injective Functions with Twin Neural Network Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05378)
*Sebastian J. Wetzel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a deterministic twin‑network + k‑NN approach to invert non‑injective mappings, validated on toy and robot arm problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard non‑injective functions lack unique inverses; local injectivity and dimensionality considerations allow selection of a preferred solution. Twin networks naturally accommodate these properties for inversion.

Method: Train a twin‑network to predict adjustments of anchor inputs producing a new output; use k‑NN to locate suitable anchor points, then deterministically recover inputs for a specified target output.

Result: The framework accurately inverts toy non‑injective functions and robot arm mappings, demonstrating effectiveness with data‑only and analytical models.

Conclusion: Twin neural network regression combined with k‑nearest neighbor search provides a deterministic method to recover input parameters of non‑injective functions, successfully applied to toy examples and robotic arm control in both data‑defined and analytically defined scenarios.

Abstract: Non-injective functions are not invertible. However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same. Further, even if the dimensionalities do not match it is often possible to choose a preferred solution from many possible solutions. Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\mathbf{x}^{\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\mathbf{x}^{\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\mathbf{y}^{\text{anchor}}$ to $\mathbf{y}^{\text{new}}$. In combination with k-nearest neighbor search, I propose a deterministic framework that finds input parameters to a given target variable of non-injective functions. The method is demonstrated by inverting non-injective functions describing toy problems and robot arm control that are a) defined by data or b) known as mathematical formula.

Conclusion: 本文系统阐述了在不确定环境下组合优化IL中专家的分类，并提出了可并行查询与交互的通用DAgger算法，验证其在动态医师分配问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) provides a data-driven framework for approximating policies for large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as sequential decision problems (SDPs), where exact solution methods are computationally intractable. A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.
  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.
  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.

Motivation: 利用集中式教师加速分散式多智能体强化学习时面临的三大瓶颈：高性能教师策略的生成、教师在离散分布状态下的推理困难以及教师与学生观测空间的不匹配。

Method: 提出 HINT 框架：使用层次化强化学习构建可扩展的高性能教师；通过伪离线强化学习利用教师与学生经验共同更新教师策略，以提升 OOD 适应性；采用基于性能的过滤机制，只保留与结果相关的指导，减少观测空间差异。

Result: 在火灾指挥资源分配和 MARINE 战术对抗等具有挑战性的合作环境中，HINT 在成功率上比基线提升 60%–165%。

Conclusion: HINT 通过层次化教师、伪离线更新与结果过滤，显著突破了传统知识蒸馏在多智能体训练中的瓶颈，证明了在集中训练、分散执行设置下的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has the potential to accelerate MARL by employing a centralized teacher for decentralized students but faces key bottlenecks. Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.

*Xiaowen He,Su Jiang,Louis J. Durlofsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Use a VAE trained on many prior simulations; then answer queries from real data using DSI, without re‑building the geological model. Accurate pressure, stress, strain and slip predictions achieved; uncertainty cut down.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying fault slip risk is vital for safe subsurface CO₂ storage, yet conventional history‑matching is difficult due to the complexity of coupled flow‑geomechanics and faults.

Method: The authors build a variational autoencoder (VAE)–based data‑space inversion (DSI) workflow. Prior geomodels (≈1000) with heterogeneous permeability/porosity and uncertain fault/rock parameters are simulated in GEOS. The VAE (stacked CNN‑LSTM) is trained on these priors to encode pressure, strain, effective normal and shear stress fields into latent variables. Observed pressure/strain from monitoring wells are then used with the VAE‑parameterization in DSI to infer posterior distributions directly from prior simulations, bypassing the need for posterior geology generation.

Result: Posterior predictions show that the DSI‑VAE approach accurately recovers pressure, strain, stress fields and fault slip tendency for synthetic truth cases, and markedly reduces uncertainty in critical geomechanical and fault‑related parameters.

Conclusion: A VAE‑driven DSI framework enables efficient, accurate posterior inference for coupled flow‑geomechanics with faults, eliminating the costly posterior geomodel generation and offering a practical tool for CO₂ storage safety assessment.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.

Result: 模型在六大文本到SQL基准上平均提升+2.3%准确率

Conclusion: RingSQL在保持SQL正确性的同时，显著提高了生成数据的多样性与质量

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-SQL systems have been driven by larger models and improved datasets, yet progress is still limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data. Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data. We make our code available at https://github.com/nu-c3lab/RingSQL.

Abstract: Recently, differentiable causal discovery has emerged as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods. However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.
  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.
  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general coding tasks but encounter two key challenges when optimizing code: (i) the complexity of writing optimized code (such as performant CUDA kernels and competition-level CPU code) requires expertise in systems, algorithms and specific languages and (ii) requires interpretation of performance metrics like timing and device utilization beyond binary correctness. In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

Motivation: FO 训练趋向锐利、泛化差的最优点；ZO 探索强但收敛慢，并在生成任务中因输出空间巨大导致估计方差放大和噪声严重。

Method: 动态层级划分并将精确 FO 更新应用于关键层，零阶优化用于较不敏感层，同时将 ZO 作为“有益随机性”以帮助摆脱局部最优。

Result: 在多种生成、数学与代码推理任务上，Hi-ZFO 均表现出更高的性能和更短的训练时间。

Conclusion: Hi-ZFO 算法通过结合第一阶梯度与零阶探索实现了比单纯 FO 更好的通用性，且显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using standard first-order (FO) optimization often drives training toward sharp, poorly generalizing minima. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external retrieval. However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.

Conclusion: DeMa在维持Mamba线性复杂度的同时，通过双路径延迟感知设计显著提升了多元时间序列任务的性能，达成了新一轮的SOTA水平

Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) analysis is increasingly critical for a wide range of intelligent applications. Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.

Abstract: A scoring system is a linear classifier composed of a small number of explanatory variables, each assigned a small integer coefficient. This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression. This research contributes to the advancement of MIO techniques for developing highly interpretable classification models.

Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.

Motivation: 传统语言模型受限于固定上下文窗口，无法在测试时扩展算力；PaCoRe旨在突破这一瓶颈，实现更多并行计算。

Conclusion: PaCoRe通过并行消息传递框架在推理阶段实现大规模并行计算，显著提升了语言模型在长文本推理中的效能。

Abstract: We introduce Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe), a training-and-inference framework designed to overcome a central limitation of contemporary language models: their inability to scale test-time compute (TTC) far beyond sequential reasoning under a fixed context window. PaCoRe departs from the traditional sequential paradigm by driving TTC through massive parallel exploration coordinated via a message-passing architecture in multiple rounds. Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens. We open-source model checkpoints, training data, and the full inference pipeline to accelerate follow-up work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 CATE 需要 $O(M/ε^2)$ 样本，仅用于估计所有分层处理效果；然而，在实际的治疗分配场景中，只需得到近似最优的分配策略。

Method: 利用粗略估计取代精确估计，结合预算灵活性，通过优化分配算法实现样本复杂度降低，并在多组真实 RCT 数据上验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在多种真实实验数据上，使用极少的样本即可实现与传统方法相近的最优治疗分配。

Conclusion: 本文展示了在自然分布的处理效果下，只需 $O(M/ε)$ 个样本就能获得与传统 CATE 方法相同的总处理效果，表明在处理分配问题中样本复杂度可显著降低。

Abstract: Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation is the de facto gold standard for targeting a treatment to a heterogeneous population. The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $ε> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/ε^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $ε$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/ε)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far fewer samples.

Conclusion: PiXTime有效解决多粒度、异构变量集在联邦时间序列预测中的挑战，实现跨节点的可迁移性和高精度预测。

Abstract: Time series are highly valuable and rarely shareable across nodes, making federated learning a promising paradigm to leverage distributed temporal data. However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series. Experiments show PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and demonstrates superior performance on eight widely used real-world traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: We reveal that transformers trained in an autoregressive manner naturally encode time-delayed causal structures in their learned representations. When predicting future values in multivariate time series, the gradient sensitivities of transformer outputs with respect to past inputs directly recover the underlying causal graph, without any explicit causal objectives or structural constraints. We prove this connection theoretically under standard identifiability conditions and develop a practical extraction method using aggregated gradient attributions. On challenging cases such as nonlinear dynamics, long-term dependencies, and non-stationary systems, this approach greatly surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, especially as data heterogeneity increases, exhibiting scaling potential where causal accuracy improves with data volume and heterogeneity, a property traditional methods lack. This unifying view lays the groundwork for a future paradigm where causal discovery operates through the lens of foundation models, and foundation models gain interpretability and enhancement through the lens of causality.

*Miguel Matey-Sanz,Joaquín Torres-Sospedra,Joaquín Huerta,Sergio Trilles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that clustering fingerprints before localisation—using spatial or radio features—can substantially reduce indoor positioning errors by focusing models on coherent data subsets, though at the cost of some floor detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor Wi‑Fi fingerprinting accuracy suffers from large, heterogeneous fingerprint datasets, significant RSSI variability, and ambiguities in multi‑floor or extensive spaces, which degrade localisation results, particularly when global models ignore structural constraints.

Method: A clustering‑based method first groups fingerprints—using spatial features or radio signatures—at the building or floor level. In localisation, unseen fingerprints are assigned to the most relevant cluster via a clustering estimation procedure that relies on the strongest access points. Subsequent localisation is performed only within the selected cluster, limiting the learning models to reduced, coherent data subsets.

Result: Evaluated on three public datasets with multiple machine‑learning models, the method consistently lowered localisation errors—most notably with building‑level clustering—while noting a trade‑off due to reduced floor detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicit dataset structuring via clustering proves to be an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning, consistently reducing localisation errors, especially at the building‑level, though it slightly lowers floor detection accuracy.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting remains one of the most practical solutions for indoor positioning, however, its performance is often limited by the size and heterogeneity of fingerprint datasets, strong Received Signal Strength Indicator variability, and the ambiguity introduced in large and multi-floor environments. These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.

Motivation: 探究稀疏自编码器是否能够识别大型语言模型中真正的推理特征。

Method: 在20种不同模型配置下，先用对比激活选取特征，然后通过因果token注入实验和LLM引导的检验，检验特征激活与推理相关性。

Result: 发现59-94%的特征对token注入高度敏感，表明依赖词法痕迹；其余特征虽不被简单触发，但不符合推理行为范式；调节这些特征对基准性能影响微小。

Conclusion: 此研究表明，使用对比法挑选的稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征主要捕捉语言学相关性而非真正的推理过程。

Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.

Conclusion: AGDC为连续与离散混合序列生成提供了一种可扩展且高精度的框架，能够在半导体电路设计和矢量图等高精度领域实现功能正确的输出。

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models excel in data generation but are inherently constrained by their reliance on discretized tokens, which limits their ability to represent continuous values with high precision. We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

Conclusion: FLRQ 在大规模语言模型的后训练量化中实现了无与伦比的精度与效率，具有可调节的层级低秩选择与剪裁优化两大创新组成。

Abstract: Traditional post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective approach to reduce model size and accelerate inference of large-scale language models (LLMs). However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \underline{F}lexible \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC). R1-FLR applies the R1-Sketch with Gaussian projection for the fast low-rank approximation, enabling outlier-aware rank extraction for each layer. Meanwhile, BLC aims at minimizing the low-rank quantization error under the scaling and clipping strategy through an iterative method. FLRQ demonstrates strong effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.

Result: 跳跃连接降低重建误差但过度泛化；注意力机制强调全局上下文，AUC最高为0.91（0-40km范围）

Conclusion: 优先使用全局上下文、牺牲像素级重建的架构，有助于实现鲁棒的自监督P波检测

Abstract: Accurate P-wave detection is critical for earthquake early warning, yet strong-motion records pose challenges due to high noise levels, limited labeled data, and complex waveform characteristics. This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce "overgeneralization", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications. These findings establish that architectural constraints favoring global context over pixel-perfect reconstruction are essential for robust, self-supervised P-wave detection.

Abstract: Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.

Conclusion: Tensor-DTI通过对分子图、蛋白质语言模型和结合位点预测等多模态特征的对比学习，显著提升了药物-靶点互作预测的准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

Conclusion: 对于长序列Transformer，位置编码与token嵌入的融合方式对性能有显著影响，值得作为模型设计的一项独立决策；在短文本中影响不大；在长文本中可获得一致提升。

Abstract: Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in representation learning approaches that uncover the latent structure of high-dimensional data, this work proposes new algorithms for reconstruction-based manifold learning within Reproducing-Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory. Numerical experiments on both simulated (concentric circles and swiss-roll) and real (cancer molecular activity and IoT network intrusions) datasets provide empirical evidence of the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and behavioral patterns. Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.

Abstract: Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method to find interpretable "parts-based" decompositions of count data. While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the "parts" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.

TL;DR: Improved exploration in RLVR for LLMs with IIB‑LPO—latent branching, IB filter/self‑reward—boosts accuracy and diversity over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rely on RLVR for LLM reasoning but face exploration collapse due to semantic homogeneity of random rollouts. Need better exploration to avoid narrow over-optimized behaviors.

Method: Propose IIB‑LPO: latent policy optimization via iterative information bottleneck. Uses latent branching at high‑entropy states for diverse reasoning paths and IB principle as trajectory filter and self‑reward to enforce concise informative exploration.

Result: On four math reasoning benchmarks, IIB‑LPO sets new SOTA: +5.3% accuracy and +7.4% diversity over prior techniques.

Conclusion: Latent policy optimization with iterative information bottleneck effectively mitigates exploration collapse, yielding broader, more informative reasoning trajectories and superior performance in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning have been hindered by a persistent challenge: exploration collapse. The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.
  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.
  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation involves transferring the predictive capabilities of large, high-performing AI models (teachers) to smaller models (students) that can operate in environments with limited computing power. In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks. Our benchmark evaluations are complemented by Explainable AI analyses showing that our distilled student models more closely match the decision structure of the original teacher model.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a persistent challenge in forecasting research and practice, particularly in business and financial analytics where forecasts inform high-stakes decisions. Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.

Abstract: Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.
