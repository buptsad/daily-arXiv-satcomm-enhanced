The primary focus\nis to understand the different dynamical phenomena observed in practice due to\nthe presence of severe nonlinearities, delays and widely varying operating\nconditions. The first models considered are of senders running TCP\n(Transmission Control Protocol) and traffic passing through RED (Random Early\nDetection) gateways. Building on earlier work, a first order nonlinear\ndiscrete-time model is developed for the interaction scenario between transport\nprotocols like TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and Active Queuing\nManagement schemes like RED. It is shown that the dynamics resulting from the\ninteraction with TCP is consistent with various dynamical behaviors and\nparameter sensitivities observed in practice. Using bifurcation-theoretic ideas\nit is shown that TCP-RED type networks may lose their stability through a\nperiod doubling bifurcation followed by border collision bifurcations. The\nnonlinear dependence of the throughput function of TCP-type flows on drop\nprobability is found to be responsible for the period doubling bifurcation,\nwhereas limited buffer space and lack of sufficient damping results in border\ncollision bifurcations. A second class of models studied in this work deals\nwith optimal rate control in networks and are based on the rate-control\nframework proposed by Kelly. Using the results on delay-differential equation\nstability, the stability and its lack thereof is studied through an underlying\nmap which arises naturally in time delay systems. An invariance property of\nthis map is used to prove delay-independent stability and to compute bounds on\nperiodic oscillations."}

To further dissect this\nregime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a\nsubset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we\nderive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first\nlayer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training\nprocess using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed\ngeneralization and representation learning characteristic of grokking."}

Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31\nparameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate\nContour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the\nanalysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all\nfeature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between\nBaseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or\nFog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of\n13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced\ndifferences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze\nstability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as\nMean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index\n(GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the\nBCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye\nmovement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other\nparameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of\nsaccades: Cliff's $\\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and\nstandard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring\nthe influence of reduced visibility on visual attention.

The primary focus\nis to understand the different dynamical phenomena observed in practice due to\nthe presence of severe nonlinearities, delays and widely varying operating\nconditions. The first models considered are of senders running TCP\n(Transmission Control Protocol) and traffic passing through RED (Random Early\nDetection) gateways. Building on earlier work, a first order nonlinear\ndiscrete-time model is developed for the interaction scenario between transport\nprotocols like TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and Active Queuing\nManagement schemes like RED. It is shown that the dynamics resulting from the\ninteraction with TCP is consistent with various dynamical behaviors and\nparameter sensitivities observed in practice. Using bifurcation-theoretic ideas\nit is shown that TCP-RED type networks may lose their stability through a\nperiod doubling bifurcation followed by border collision bifurcations. The\nnonlinear dependence of the throughput function of TCP-type flows on drop\nprobability is found to be responsible for the period doubling bifurcation,\nwhereas limited buffer space and lack of sufficient damping results in border\ncollision bifurcations. A second class of models studied in this work deals\nwith optimal rate control in networks and are based on the rate-control\nframework proposed by Kelly. Using the results on delay-differential equation\nstability, the stability and its lack thereof is studied through an underlying\nmap which arises naturally in time delay systems. An invariance property of\nthis map is used to prove delay-independent stability and to compute bounds on\nperiodic oscillations."}

Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical\nparameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are\noptimized using parameter-shift gradients.

To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm\n(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict \"wrong\"\ndirection regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance\nratio falls below (above) $1 - \\beta$ ($1+\\beta$),\n  for a tunable parameter $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a\nsteeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that\nDClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing\non modifying the objective's behavior in the \"right\" direction, across various\nMuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is\nshown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid \"wrong\" direction\nupdates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1."}

To formally characterize the local information\nprocessing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory\n- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as\nan information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each\nneuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more\nthan tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks\nand even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield\nnetworks.
