However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It is essential for privacy-preserving applications such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and financial data analysis. In popular HE schemes, ciphertext multiplication is only defined for two inputs. However, the multiplication of multiple inputs is needed in many HE applications. In our previous work, a three-input ciphertext multiplication method for the CKKS HE scheme was developed. This paper first reformulates the three-input ciphertext multiplication to enable the combination of computations in order to further reduce the complexity. The second contribution is extending the multiplication to multiple inputs without compromising the noise overhead. Additional evaluation keys are introduced to achieve relinearization of polynomial multiplication results. To minimize the complexity of the large number of rescaling units in the multiplier, a theoretical analysis is developed to relocate the rescaling, and a multi-level rescaling approach is proposed to implement combined rescaling with complexity similar to that of a single rescaling unit. Guidelines and examples are provided on the input partition to enable the combination of more rescaling. Additionally, efficient hardware architectures are designed to implement our proposed multipliers. The improved three-input ciphertext multiplier reduces the logic area and latency by 15% and 50%, respectively, compared to the best prior design. For multipliers with more inputs, ranging from 4 to 12, the architectural analysis reveals 32% savings in area and 45% shorter latency, on average, compared to prior work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e58\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u5347\u9ad8\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u91cd\u7ebf\u5316\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9762\u79ef\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u4e58\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e94\u7528\uff08ML\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4e2d\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9700\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u6784\u4e09\u8f93\u5165\u4e58\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u952e\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4e58\u79ef\u91cd\u7ebf\u5316\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u8f93\u5165\u5212\u5206\u6307\u5357\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u8f93\u5165\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u903b\u8f91\u9762\u79ef\u4e0b\u964d15%\uff0c\u65f6\u5ef6\u964d\u4f4e50%\uff1b\u591a\u8f93\u5165(4-12)\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u9762\u79ef\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u770132%\uff0c\u65f6\u5ef6\u7f29\u77ed45%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u517c\u5408\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u8f93\u5165\u4e58\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u566a\u58f0\u5f00\u9500\u4e0d\u5347\u9ad8\u3002"}}

To ensure fast and safe charging, complex communication is required between the vehicle and the charging station. In the globally used Combined Charging System (CCS), this communication is carried over the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) physical layer. However, HPGP is known to suffer from wireless leakage, which may expose this data link to nearby attackers.\n  In this paper, we examine active wireless attacks against CCS, and study the impact they can have. We present the first real-time Software-Defined Radio (SDR) implementation of HPGP, granting unprecedented access to the communications within the charging cables. We analyze the characteristics of 2,750 real-world charging sessions to understand the timing constraints for hijacking. Using novel techniques to increase the attacks' reliability, we design a robust wireless Man-in-the-Middle evaluation framework for CCS.\n  We demonstrate full control over TLS usage and CCS protocol version negotiation, including TLS stripping attacks. We investigate how real devices respond to safety-critical MitM attacks, which modify power delivery information, and found target vehicles to be highly permissive. First, we caused a vehicle to display charging power exceeding 900 kW on the dashboard, while receiving only 40 kW.

To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods.

Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \\emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet.

Final camera-ready version forthcoming", "summary": "We introduce a new family of polar-like codes, called Partially Polarized Polar (PPP) codes. PPP codes are constructed from conventional polar codes by selectively pruning polarization kernels, thereby modifying the synthesized bit-channel capacities to ensure a guaranteed number of non-frozen bits available early in decoding. These early-access information bits enable more effective early termination, which is particularly valuable for blind decoding in downlink control channels, where user equipment (UE) must process multiple candidates, many of which carry no valid control information.

We aim to achieve two main objectives: i) provide a reliable communication infrastructure, thereby ensuring the continuity of search-and-rescue activities and connecting people to their loved ones, and ii) detect users, such as those trapped under rubble or those who are mobile, using a Doppler-based mobility detection model. We employ an innovative beamforming method that simultaneously transmits data and detects Doppler-based mobility by integrating multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication and monostatic sensing within the same transmission chain.

To address this limitation, we propose Data-Free Selective Unlearning (DFSU), a novel privacy-preserving framework that removes sensitive PII from an LLM without requiring its training data. Our approach first synthesizes pseudo-PII through language model inversion, then constructs token-level privacy masks for these synthetic samples, and finally performs token-level selective unlearning via a contrastive mask loss within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) subspace.

We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages.

The system's primary objective is to levitate a steel ball using electromagnetic force without physical contact, thereby eliminating frictional losses. A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization. The full-order observer enhanced estimation accuracy, enabling effective control where direct state measurement was impractical. The LQR-based control offered improved robustness and minimized control effort, though its performance was comparable to standard state feedback in some cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u78c1\u7403\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cLQR \u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u60ac\u6d6e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u7403\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5178\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e3b\u52a8\u7535\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6469\u64e6\u60ac\u6d6e\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u70b9\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u673a\u68b0\u4e0e\u7535\u6c14\u8026\u5408\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u6781\u70b9\u914d\u7f6e\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5168\u9636\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff08LQR\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7 Simulink \u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6781\u70b9\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e LQR \u4e0b\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u632f\u52a8\uff1b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u77ac\u6001\u632f\u8361\uff1b\u5168\u9636\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff1bLQR \u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f73\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u53ca\u53cd\u9988\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u78c1\u7403\u60ac\u6d6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u4e09\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u6781\u70b9\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u5168\u9636\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u3001LQR\uff09\u5747\u80fd\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u671f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dLQR\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002"}}

The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Mixture-of-Experts\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165null\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee4\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u4ec5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c11\u6570\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5df2\u89c1\u6548\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52MoE\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165null\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u69fd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u548cnull\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6df7\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u671f\u671bFLOPs\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0cCausal Token-Choice MoE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9token\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\u5730\u5206\u914dnull\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow.

However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies.

In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u7684ISAC\u901a\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u901a\u9053\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u6216\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u517c\u987e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u901a\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6784\u5efaSTCM\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5728\u5404\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "STCM\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590dISAC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u7684ISAC\u901a\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u539f\u5219\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53cc\u80de\u80ce\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff08STCM\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u7ec6\u8282\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Parallel FIR filtering enhances computational efficiency and throughput in digital signal processing (DSP) applications by enabling the simultaneous processing of multiple input samples. We revisit a prior approach to design of fast parallel filter architectures by using the iterated FFA approach where the same primitive filter, such as 2-parallel, is iterated to design the fast parallel filter. In this paper, we present yet another novel iterated fast parallel FIR filter, referred to as the fast hybrid filter. The hybrid filter iterates a transposed 2-parallel fast FIR filter in all the inner layers and a direct-form 2-parallel fast FIR filter in the outermost layer, resulting in reduced hardware complexity. Such an iterated hybrid approach has not been presented before. We show that the hybrid fast parallel filters require less number of additions compared to prior approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5e76\u884cFIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5feb\u901fFIR\u7b97\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u52a0\u6cd5\u91cf\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728DSP\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e76\u884cFIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76f8\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u5feb\u901fFIR\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u7f6e\u578b2-\u5e76\u884c\u5feb\u901fFIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u578b2-\u5e76\u884c\u5feb\u901fFIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u5e76\u884c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u52a0\u6cd5\u6b21\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5feb\u901f\u5e76\u884cFIR\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u2014\u2014\u5feb\u901f\u6df7\u5408\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u52a0\u6cd5\u6b21\u6570\u3002"}}

We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines.

Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions.

This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOFDM+\u5541\u557e\u4eff\u5c04\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u964d\u4f4ePAPR\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5206\u914d\u611f\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfOFDM\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u53cc\u91cd\u9700\u6c42\u4e2d\u9700\u5212\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6OFDM\u9ad8PAPR\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u3002\u6545\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u4f4ePAPR\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eff\u5c04\u52a0\u6cd5\u5c06OFDM\u4e0e\u5541\u557e\u6ce2\u5f62\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5e38\u6570\u5305\u7edcOFDM\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5728\u65f6\u9699\u7ea7\u522b\u5c06\u5541\u557e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5d4c\u5165OFDM\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u5c04\u590d\u5408\u6ce2\u5f62\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684PAPR\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u5cf0\u503c\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6RMSE\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f73\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eOFDM\u4e0e\u5541\u557e\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u590d\u5408\u6ce2\u5f62\u80fd\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4ePAPR\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d1\u5c04\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Although feature selection is commonly employed to mitigate these issues, many existing approaches lack robustness when applied to large-scale and heterogeneous malware data. To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation. Additional analyses demonstrate low inter-feature redundancy and improved interpretability through SHAP-based explanations. Runtime and memory profiling further indicate reduced downstream classification overhead. Overall, CAFE-GB provides a stable, interpretable, and scalable feature selection strategy for large-scale malware detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments.

Unsurprisingly, fuzz testing firmware is an active research field with new advances addressing the unique challenges in the domain. However, understanding and evaluating improvements by deriving metrics such as code coverage and unique crashes are problematic, leading to a desire for a reliable bug-based benchmark. To address the need, we design and build FirmReBugger, a holistic framework for fairly assessing monolithic firmware fuzzers with a realistic, diverse, bug-based benchmark. FirmReBugger proposes using bug oracles--C syntax expressions of bug descriptors--with an interpreter to automate analysis and accurately report on bugs discovered, discriminating between states of detected, triggered, reached and not reached. Importantly, our idea of benchmarking does not modify the target binary and simply replays fuzzing seeds to isolate the benchmark implementation from the fuzzer while providing a simple means to extend with new bug oracles. Further, analyzing fuzzing roadblocks, we created FirmBench, a set of diverse, real-world binary targets with 313 software bug oracles. Incorporating our analysis of roadblocks challenging monolithic firmware fuzzing, the bench provides for rapid evaluation of future advances.

Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become widely adopted as safety filters. However, standard CBF formulations do not explicitly account for state estimation uncertainty and its propagation, especially for stochastic systems evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u968f\u673a\u65e0\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684CBF\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCBF\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u8fc7\u7a0b\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ece\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u674e\u7fa4\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027"}}

These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences.

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent.

We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC.

Typical communication signals comprise both deterministic known pilot signals and random unknown data payloads. Most existing approaches either rely solely on pilots for positioning, thereby ignoring the radar information present in the received data symbols that constitute the majority of each frame, or rely on data decisions, which bounds positioning performance to that of the communication system. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that extracts positioning information from data payloads without decoding them.

While encryption effectively protects message content, packet metadata and statistics inadvertently expose device identities and user contexts. Various studies have exploited raw packet statistics and their visual representations for device fingerprinting and identification. However, these approaches remain confined to the spatial domain with limited feature representation. Therefore, this paper presents CONTEX-T, a novel framework that exploits contextual privacy vulnerabilities using spectral representation of encrypted wireless traffic for IoT device characterization. The experiments show that spectral analysis provides new and rich feature representation for covert reconnaissance attacks, revealing a complex and expanding threat landscape that would require robust countermeasures for IoT security management. CONTEXT-T first transforms raw packet length sequences into time-frequency spectral representations and then utilizes transformer-based spectral analysis for the device identification. We systematically evaluated multiple spectral representation techniques and transformer-based models across encrypted traffic samples from various IoT devices. CONTEXT-T effectively exploited privacy vulnerabilities and achieved device classification accuracy exceeding 99% across all devices while remaining completely passive and undetectable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

From review sites to court documents, ``natural'' content has been contaminated by data points that appear similar to natural data, but are in fact LLM-generated. In this work we revisit fundamental learning theory questions in this, now ubiquitous, setting. We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.\n  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature.

In this paper, a dual-mapping SVC (DM-SVC) based short packet transmission scheme is proposed to further enhance the transmission performance of SVC. The core idea behind the proposed scheme lies in mapping the transmitted information bits onto sparse vectors via block and single-element sparse mappings. The block sparse mapping pattern is able to concentrate the transmit power in a small number of non-zero blocks thus improving the decoding accuracy, while the single-element sparse mapping pattern ensures that the code length does not increase dramatically with the number of transmitted information bits. At the receiver, a two-stage decoding algorithm is proposed to sequentially identify non-zero block indexes and single-element non-zero indexes. Extensive simulation results verify that proposed DM-SVC scheme outperforms the existing SVC schemes in terms of block error rate and spectral efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network for low-altitude surveillance. This network employs RISs to reflect ISAC signals into low-altitude space for sensing. To enhance signal strength, we employ active RIS (ARIS) to amplify the signals. Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration.

We consider the case where the IO signal is available at each receiver node through a reference channel, whereas target returns corrupted by interference are collected in a separate surveillance channel. The problem formulation is similar to an active radar that uses a noise-like waveform, or an integrated sensing and communication application. The available data is first split into batches of manageable size. In the direct approach, the target's time-delay and Doppler parameters are estimated jointly by incoherently combining the batch-wise data. We propose a new method to estimate the time-delay separately, thus avoiding a costly 2-D search. Our approach is designed for slowly moving targets, and the accuracy of the time-delay estimate is similar to that of the full batch-wise 2-D method. Given the time-delay, the coherency between batches can be restored when estimating the Doppler parameter. Thereby, the separable approach is found to yield superior Doppler estimates over a wide parameter range. In addition to reducing computational complexity, the proposed separable estimation technique also significantly reduces the communication overhead in a distributed radar setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77.

To support flexible spatial processing and meet the demands of latency critical applications, it is essential to use fully digital mmWave MIMO beamforming, which relies on accurate channel estimation. However, ensuring power efficiency in fully digital mmWave MIMO systems requires the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The reduced resolution of these quantizers introduces distortion in both transmitted and received signals, ultimately degrading system performance. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation performance of mmWave MIMO systems employing fully digital beamforming with low-resolution quantization, under practical system constraints. We evaluate the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results demonstrate that a moderate quantization resolutions of 4-bit per DAC/ADC offers a favorable trade-off between energy consumption and achievable data rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "4 \u4f4d DAC/ADC \u5728\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2 MIMO \u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e2d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6298\u4e2d\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8003\u8651\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2 MIMO \u9891\u6bb5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u7387\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387 ADC/DAC\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5316\u5931\u771f\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2 MIMO \u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff08SE\uff09\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff08EE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c4 \u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u8f83\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2 MIMO \u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u75284\u4f4d\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684 DAC/ADC \u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6298\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u517c\u987e\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks.

So far, the two worlds of WSI and QPI have not been combined. In this work, we present a reconstruction algorithm which makes whole slide imaging of cervical smears possible by using a self-referencing three-wave digital holographic microscope. Since a WSI is constructed by combining multiple patches, the algorithm is adaptive and can be used on partial holograms and patched holograms.

We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference.\n  We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa CovMatch\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u5411/\u6709\u5411\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\uff1b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u9525\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf GTI \u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u590d\u6742\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u4e3a\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u628a\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65e0\u5411\u56fe\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u9525\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCovMatch \u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "CovMatch \u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u65e0\u73af\u6027\u6216\u6b63\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5411\u6216\u6709\u5411\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u3002"}}

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8111\u533a MRI \u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 Boruta \u9009\u53d6\u91cd\u8981\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u5178\u578b AD\uff08atAD\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\uff08MRI\uff09\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u5178\u578b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\uff08atAD\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u8bca\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5916\u52a0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5168\u8111MRI\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Boruta\u7b97\u6cd5\u6311\u9009\u663e\u8457\u8111\u533a\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9 atAD \u4e0e\u975eAD \u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728NACC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f369%\uff08\u4ece52%\uff09\uff0c\u5728ADNI\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u81f377%\uff08\u4ece34%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927MRI\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Boruta\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u673a\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u5178\u578b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e38\u89c4\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eMRI\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206 atAD \u4e0e\u975e AD \u75c5\u4f8b\u3002"}}

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization.

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\u03c0$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream.

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline.

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models.

Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation.

Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching.

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u5408\u533b\u9662\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7528\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4f11\u65af\u6566\u533b\u9662\u8bbf\u95ee\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Deep Gravity\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001ICU\u5360\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u5ea6\u53ca\u65cf\u88d4\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u7b49\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u533b\u9662\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u79bb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u4f53\u6574\u5408\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08Naive Regression\u3001Gradient Boosting\u3001MLP\u3001Deep Gravity\u3001HGNN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528SHAP\u548cPDP\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "Deep Gravity\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d7\u533b\u9662\u8bc4\u5206\u9a71\u52a8\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u65cf\u88d4\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bc4\u5206\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u88d4\u3001\u9ed1\u4eba\u3001\u672a\u6210\u5e74\u548c\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u5730\u533a\u8bbf\u95ee\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u9662\u8bbf\u95ee\u6d41\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u533b\u9662\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001ICU\u5360\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u65c5\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $\u0398(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound.

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions.

We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\\left(T^{\\max\\{\u03b2,1-\u03b2\\}}\\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\\left(T^{1-\u03b2}\\right)$ for any $\u03b2\\in (0,1)$.

However their evaluations are often conducted in isolation or compared against traditional machine learning methods or trivially adapted vision-based architectures that were not originally proposed for Raman spectroscopy. As a result, direct comparisons between existing deep learning models developed specifically for Raman spectral analysis on shared open-source datasets remain scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first systematic benchmarks comparing three or more published Raman-specific deep learning classifiers across multiple open-source Raman datasets. We evaluate five representative deep learning architectures under a unified training and hyperparameter tuning protocol across three open-source Raman datasets selected to support standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and explicit distribution-shift testing. We report classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores to provide a fair and reproducible comparison of deep learning models for Raman spectra based classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e13\u4e3aRaman\u5149\u8c31\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5b8fF1\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u6216\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9aRaman\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u4efd\u516c\u5f00\u7684Raman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5728Raman\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u6279\u9488\u5bf9Raman\u5149\u8c31\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_\u03c1$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $\u03a9$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $\u03a9$. Given a probability measure $\u03bc$ on $\u03a9$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $\u03c6\\to \\int_\u03a9K(\\cdot,x)\u03c6(x)d\u03bc(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $\u03a9$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $\u03bc$ supported on $\u03a9$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + \u03b5})$ for any $\u03b5> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $\u03bc$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $\u03b5$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(\u03b5^{-d_\u03c1}\\log\\frac{1}\u03b5\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_\u03c1$, even though $d_K = d_\u03c1$ provably holds on regular domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Beat-SSL\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b93%\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1+4%\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684ECG\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u6216\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528ECG\u7279\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u7b7e\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f53\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9ECG\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u800c\u975e\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u4e24\u7c7b\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cBeat-SSL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b93%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u9ad8\u51fa4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Beat-SSL\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u548c\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fc3\u5f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0eECG\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erd\u0151s' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis.

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u540e\u7f6e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u91ca\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u627f\u62c5\u89e3\u91ca\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u91ca\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u5408\u4e4e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u91ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u800c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u7b26\u5408\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
