Due to the nature of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications, black-box defenses are more practical than white-box methods, yet existing purification techniques suffer from key limitations: a lack of justification for specific transformations, dataset dependency, high computational overhead, and a neglect of frequency-domain transformations. This paper conducts a preliminary study on various image transformations, identifying down-upscaling as the most effective backdoor trigger disruption technique. We subsequently propose \\texttt{Lite-BD}, a lightweight two-stage blackbox backdoor defense. \\texttt{Lite-BD} first employs a super-resolution-based down-upscaling stage to neutralize spatial triggers. A secondary stage utilizes query-based band-by-band frequency filtering to remove triggers hidden in specific bands.

However, this signal-level fidelity-oriented design often incurs high communication overhead and system complexity, particularly in video communication scenarios where mainstream frameworks rely on transmitting visual data itself, resulting in significant bandwidth consumption. To address this issue, we propose a visual data-free communication framework, Mirage, for extremely efficient video transmission while preserving semantic information. Mirage decomposes video content into two complementary components: temporal sequence information capturing motion dynamics and spatial appearance representations describing overall visual structure. Temporal information is preserved through video captioning, while key frames are encoded into compact semantic representations for spatial appearance. These representations are transmitted to the receiver, where videos are synthesized using generative video models. Since no raw visual data is transmitted, Mirage is inherently privacy-preserving. Mirage also supports personalized adaptation across deployment scenarios. The sender, network, and receiver can independently impose constraints on semantic representation, transmission, and generation, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency, privacy, control, and perceptual quality. Experimental results in video transmission demonstrate that Mirage achieves up to a 50000X data-level compression speedup over raw video transmission, with gains expected to scale with larger video content sizes."}

The network is modeled as a directed acyclic graph. A sink node wishes to compute a function of messages generated by multiple distributed sources, while an eavesdropper can access exactly one wiretap set from a given collection. The eavesdropper must be prevented from obtaining any information about a specified security function of the source messages. The secure computing capacity is the maximum average number of times that the target function can be securely computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap sets and security function for one use of the network. We establish two upper bounds on this capacity, which hold for arbitrary network topologies and for any vector linear target and security functions. These bounds generalize existing results and also lead to a new upper bound when the target function is the sum over a finite field. For the lower bound, when the target function is the sum, we extend an existing method, which transforms a non-secure network code into a secure one, to the case where the security function is vector linear. Furthermore, for a particular class of networks and a vector linear target function, we characterize the required properties of the global encoding matrix to construct a secure vector linear network code."}

Deploying large models (LMs) in mobile edge networks emerges as a promising solution. However, it also poses new challenges, including heterogeneous multi-modal LMs with diverse resource demands and inference speeds, varied prompt/output modalities that complicate orchestration, and resource-limited infrastructure ill-suited for concurrent LM execution. In response, we propose a Multi-Agentic AI framework for latency- and fairness-aware multi-modal LM inference in mobile edge networks. Our solution includes a long-term planning agent, a short-term prompt scheduling agent, and multiple on-node LM deployment agents, all powered by foundation language models. These agents cooperatively optimize prompt routing and LM deployment through natural language reasoning over runtime telemetry and historical experience. To evaluate its performance, we further develop a city-wide testbed that supports network monitoring, containerized LM deployment, intra-server resource management, and inter-server communications. Experiments demonstrate that our solution reduces average latency by over 80% and improves fairness (Normalized Jain index) to 0.90 compared to other baselines. Moreover, our solution adapts quickly without fine-tuning, offering a generalizable solution for optimizing GenAI services in edge environments."}

The core element of an SNN is the spiking neuron, which converts input data into spikes following the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model. This model includes several important hyperparameters, such as the membrane potential threshold and membrane time constant. Both the DNNs and SNNs have proven to be exploitable by backdoor attacks, where an adversary can poison the training dataset with malicious triggers and force the model to behave in an attacker-defined manner. Yet, how an adversary can exploit the unique characteristics of SNNs for backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \\textit{BadSNN}, a novel backdoor attack on spiking neural networks that exploits hyperparameter variations of spiking neurons to inject backdoor behavior into the model. We further propose a trigger optimization process to achieve better attack performance while making trigger patterns less perceptible. \\textit{BadSNN} demonstrates superior attack performance on various datasets and architectures, as well as compared with state-of-the-art data poisoning-based backdoor attacks and robustness against common backdoor mitigation techniques.

To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm.

However, a fundamental architectural constraint, that only a limited number of hardware events can be monitored concurrently, creates a significant bottleneck, leading to detection blind spots. Prior work has primarily focused on optimizing machine learning models for a single, statically chosen event set, or on ensembling models over the same feature set. We argue that robustness requires diversifying not only the models, but also the underlying feature sets (i.e., the monitored hardware events) in order to capture a broader spectrum of program behavior. This observation motivates the following research question: Can detection performance be improved by trading temporal granularity for broader coverage, via the strategic scheduling of different feature sets over time? To answer this question, we propose Hydra, a novel detection mechanism that partitions execution traces into time slices and learns an effective schedule of feature sets and corresponding classifiers for deployment. By cycling through complementary feature sets, Hydra mitigates the limitations of a fixed monitoring perspective. Our experimental evaluation shows that Hydra significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-feature-set baselines, achieving a 19.32% improvement in F1 score and a 60.23% reduction in false positive rate. These results underscore the importance of feature-set diversity and establish strategic multi-feature-set scheduling as an effective principle for robust, hardware-assisted malware detection."}

In this paper, we develop two topology design methods that explicitly operate under real-world deployment constraints: the Long--Short Links (LSL) method, which systematically combines long-distance shortcut links with short-distance local links, and the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, which constructs topologies via stochastic optimization. Evaluated under both full deployment and partial deployment scenarios using 3-months of Starlink data, our methods achieve up to 45% lower average end-to-end delay, 65% fewer hops, and up to $2.3\\times$ higher network capacity compared to +Grid. Both methods are designed to handle daily node turnovers by incrementally updating the topology, maintaining good network performance while avoiding costly full reconstruction of the topology."}

Input-constrained control barrier functions (ICCBFs) provide a framework for safety certification under bounded actuation; however, conventional ICCBF formulations can be overly conservative and exhibit limited robustness to uncertainty, leading to high fuel consumption and reduced mission feasibility. This paper proposes a framework in which the full hierarchy of class-$\\mathcal{K}$ functions defining the ICCBF recursion is parameterized and learned, enabling localized shaping of the safe set and reduced conservatism. A control margin is computed efficiently using differential algebra to enable the learned continuous-time ICCBFs to be implemented on time-sampled dynamical systems typical of spacecraft proximity operations. A meta-reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train a policy that generates ICCBF parameters over a distribution of hidden physical parameters and uncertainties, using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Simulation results on cruise control, spacecraft inspection, and docking scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains safety while reducing fuel consumption and improving feasibility relative to fixed class-$\\mathcal{K}$ ICCBFs, with the RNN showing a particularly strong advantage in the more complex inspection case."}

In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

As AVs operate in safety-critical environments, understanding their robustness in an adversarial environment is an important research problem. Prior physical adversarial attacks on vision-based autonomous vehicles predominantly target immediate safety failures (e.g., a crash, a traffic-rule violation, or a transient lane departure) by inducing a short-lived perception or control error. This paper shows a qualitatively different risk: a long-horizon route integrity compromise, where an attacker gradually steers a victim AV away from its intended route and into an attacker-chosen destination while the victim continues to drive \"normally.\" This will not pose a danger to the victim vehicle itself, but also to potential passengers sitting inside the vehicle.\n  In this paper, we design and implement the first adversarial framework, called JackZebra, that performs route-level hijacking of a vision-based end-to-end driving stack using a physically plausible attacker vehicle with a reconfigurable display mounted on the rear. The central challenge is temporal persistence: adversarial influence must remain effective in changing viewpoints, lighting, weather, traffic, and the victim's continual replanning -- without triggering conspicuous failures. Our key insight is to treat route hijacking as a closed-loop control problem and to convert adversarial patches into steering primitives that can be selected online via an interactive adjustment loop. Our adversarial patches are also carefully designed against worst-case background and sensor variations so that the adversarial impacts on the victim. Our evaluation shows that JackZebra can successfully hijack victim vehicles to deviate from original routes and stop at adversarial destinations with a high success rate."}

We derive novel closed-form expressions for the power distributions of the received signal at the users and the interfering signal.

We propose an LLM-aided SINDy pipeline that iteratively refines candidate equations using a large language model (LLM) in the loop through in-context learning. The pipeline begins with a baseline SINDy model fit using an adaptive library and then enters a LLM-guided refinement cycle. At each iteration, the current best equations, error metrics, and domain-specific constraints are summarized in a prompt to the LLM, which suggests new equation structures. These candidate equations are parsed against a defined symbolic form and evaluated on training and test data. The pipeline uses simulation-based error as a primary metric, but also assesses structural similarity to ground truth, including matching functional forms, key terms, couplings, qualitative behavior. An iterative stopping criterion ends refinement early if test error falls below a threshold (NRMSE < 0.1) or if a maximum of 10 iterations is reached. Finally, the best model is selected, and we evaluate this LLM-aided SINDy on 63 dynamical system datasets (ODEBench) and march leuba model for boiling nuclear reactor. The results are compared against classical SINDy and show the LLM-loop consistently improves symbolic recovery with higher equation similarity to ground truth and lower test RMSE than baseline SINDy for cases with complex dynamics.

Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities."}

Unlike classical distributed storage systems, DNA data storage containers are fundamentally constrained by sequencing technology, since each read operation yields the content of a uniformly random sampled strand from the container. Within this framework, we consider several erasure-correcting codes and analyze the expected recovery time of the data stored in a failed container. Our results are obtained by analyzing generalized versions of the classical Coupon Collector's Problem, which may be of independent interest."}

To address these limitations, we introduce differentiable causal block diagrams ($\\partial$CBDs), a unifying formalism that integrates these three perspectives.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes the first cross-modal generation framework based on EEG-MEG spatiotemporal coupled representations to synthesize MEG signals cost-effectively. The framework first extracts general neural activity representations through a pre-trained EEG model. Building upon these representations, the framework effectively learns the lower spatial dispersion and higher high-frequency sensitivity of MEG via the spatial focus mapping module and the broadband spectral calibration module. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthesized MEG signals show high consistency with the real MEG in both time-frequency characteristics and source space activation patterns. More importantly, downstream BCI decoding experiments demonstrate that using synthesized MEG leads to performance enhancements not only on paired EEG-MEG datasets but also on independent EEG-only datasets. Overall, this framework opens a new avenue for overcoming data bottlenecks in BCI."}

However, most machine learning-based IDS approaches either assume static data distributions or rely on labeled attack samples, substantially limiting their applicability in real-world deployments. This setting naturally motivates continual novelty detection, which enables IDS models to incrementally adapt to non-stationary data streams without labeled attack data. In this work, we introduce ACORN-IDS, an adaptive continual novelty detection framework that learns exclusively from normal data while exploiting the inherent structure of an evolving unlabeled data stream. ACORN-IDS integrates a continual feature extractor, trained using reconstruction and metric learning objectives with clustering-based pseudo-labels, alongside a PCA-based reconstruction module for anomaly scoring. This design allows ACORN-IDS to continuously adapt to distributional shifts in both benign and malicious traffic. We conduct an extensive evaluation of ACORN-IDS on five realistic intrusion datasets under two continual learning scenarios: (i) Evolving Attacks and (ii) Evolving Normal and Attack Distributions. ACORN-IDS achieves, on average, a 62% improvement in F1-score and a 58% improvement in zero-day attack detection over the state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning baseline. It also outperforms existing state-of-the-art novelty detection approaches while exhibiting near-zero forgetting and imposing minimal inference overhead.

Built upon this architecture, we introduce the Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based Multi-Expert Collaborative Decision (DHEA-MECD), a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm designed to support efficient and robust multi-target tracking. Specifically, in DHEA-MECD, a Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based information extraction framework is designed to semantically decompose raw sensory observations and explicitly model complex dependencies among heterogeneous features, including spatial configurations, kinematic states, structural constraints, and stochastic perturbations. On this basis, a motion-stage-aware multi-expert collaborative decision mechanism with Top-k expert selection strategy is introduced to support stage-adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, we propose the DHEA-MECD-based underwater multitarget tracking algorithm to enable AUV smart, stable, and anti-interference multi-target tracking.

Building on Streamlet's streamlined structure, we introduce a \\textit{Channel-Aware Leader Election (CALE)} mechanism. CALE serves as a verifiable cross-layer cognitive engine that leverages receiver-measured channel state information (CSI) piggybacked in signed votes to derive Byzantine-robust connectivity scores from notarization certificates, and deterministically selects a unique weighted leader per epoch from finalized history, thereby improving proposal dissemination reliability under deep fading. Complementing this cognitive adaptation, Wireless Streamlet exploits the single-hop broadcast medium and a deterministic TDMA voting schedule to achieve linear per-epoch on-air transmissions (slot complexity), ensuring deterministic spectral access. To address the communication-storage trade-off, we further propose a coded dual-chain architecture that decouples header-only consensus (State Chain) from payload data (Data Chain). By employing erasure coding and on-chain integrity commitments, the system minimizes redundant spectrum usage for data retrieval while ensuring availability.

Dedicated subnetworks are used to process EEG features and auxiliary modalities, and a shared autoencoder-based fusion module is used to learn discriminative latent representations before classification. Subject-dependent experiments conducted on the PhyMER dataset across seven emotional classes achieve an accuracy of 95.45%, surpassing previously reported results. Furthermore, temporal attention analysis provides interpretable insights into emotion-specific temporal relevance, and t-SNE visualizations demonstrate enhanced class separability, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents."}

Existing research remains in its preliminary exploratory phase. On the one hand, multi-class models do not account for fixed user class scenarios, which may not align with actual commuters; on the other hand, there is a lack of systematic quantitative analysis based on real-world complex road networks across multiple cities. As a result, the congestion effects induced by heterogeneous GV-EV cost structures may be mischaracterized or substantially underestimated. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-user equilibrium (MUE) assignment model for mixed GV-EV traffic, constructs a dual algorithm with convergence guarantees, and designs multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for congestion patterns. Using 10 representative U.S. cities as a case study, this research explores the evolution trends of traffic congestion under different EV penetration scenarios based on real city-level road networks and block-level commuter origin-destination (OD) demand. The results show that full EV penetration reduces average system travel time by 2.27%--10.78% across the 10 cities, with New Orleans achieving the largest reduction (10.78%) and San Francisco the smallest (2.27%), but the effectiveness of alleviating congestion exhibits urban heterogeneity. Moreover, for cities with sufficient network redundancy, benefits are primarily concentrated during the low to medium EV penetration stage (0-0.5), though cities with topological constraints (e.g., San Francisco) show more limited improvements throughout all penetration levels. This paper can provide a foundation for formulating differentiated urban planning and congestion management policies."}

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines. It remains robust to adaptive attackers and across multiple foundation models, showing that explicit memory management enables secure, dynamic LLM agent architectures.

As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying.\n  MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription.

However, the academic community has long lacked a predictive method connecting underlying topology to high-level service fairness. To bridge this gap, this paper analyzes a QoE imbalance index ($I$) through the lens of spectral graph theory.Our core contribution is the proof of a novel exponential spectral upper bound. This bound reveals that the improvement of QoE fairness exhibits an exponential decay behavior only above a performance threshold determined jointly by network size and connectivity. Its core decay rate is dominated by the weaker of two factors: the SLA stringency ($a$) and the network's spectral gap ($cλ_2$). The upper bound unifies the service protocol and the topological bottleneck within a single performance bound formula for the first time.This theoretical relationship also reveals a clear bottleneck effect, where the system's fairness ceiling is determined by the weaker link between service parameters and network structure. This finding provides a bottleneck-driven principle for resource optimization in network design and enables goal-driven reverse engineering. Extensive numerical experiments on various random graph models and real-world network topologies robustly validate the correctness and universality of our analytical framework."}

Particularly, the stochasticity is depicted by the Brownian motion. To handle this problem, we propose a continuous-time distributed stochastic gradient algorithm based on the consensus algorithm and the gradient descent strategy. Under mild assumptions on the connectivity of the graph and objective functions, using convex analysis theory, the Lyapunov theory and Ito formula, we prove that the states of the agents asymptotically reach a common minimizer in expectation.

A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x."}

By identifying the underlying stochastic transport mechanism as a Gaussian variance-mixture, we introduce and analyze the Normally-Drifted First-Hitting Location (NDFHL) family as a geometry-driven model for boundary-induced noise. Under a second-moment constraint, we derive an exact high-SNR capacity expansion and show that the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide at the constant level, yielding a vanishing capacity gap. As a consequence, isotropic Gaussian signaling is asymptotically capacity-achieving for all fixed drift strengths, despite the non-Gaussian and semi-heavy-tailed nature of the noise. The pre-log factor is determined solely by the dimension of the receiving boundary, revealing a geometric origin of the channel's degrees of freedom. The refined expansion further uncovers an entropy-dominant universality, whereby all physical parameters of the transport process -- including drift strength, diffusion coefficient, and boundary separation -- affect the capacity only through the differential entropy of the induced noise. Although the NDFHL density does not admit a simple closed form, its entropy is shown to be finite and to vary continuously as the drift vanishes, thereby connecting the finite-variance regime with the singular infinite-variance Cauchy limit. Together, these results provide a unified geometric and information-theoretic characterization of boundary-hitting channels across both regular and singular transport regimes."}

The problem is highly nonconvex due to the discrete HAPS count and the environment-dependent 3D Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To address this, we develop a tailored version of the adaptive special-crowding distance non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ASDNSGA-II).

A total of 16 time-domain, frequency-domain, and memory-related features are used to provide a low-dimensional representation of bandwidth-induced pulse distortion. These features are mapped by a fully connected neural network to complex-valued matched filter coefficients, enabling adaptive pulse-shape compensation prior to symbol-rate sampling. The network is trained end-to-end using a differentiable loss function based on error vector magnitude (EVM). Experimental results obtained using a hardware-in-the-loop CAP transmission system demonstrate that the proposed deformable matched filter significantly outperforms conventional fixed matched filtering under severe bandwidth constraints, without requiring decision feedback or increasing receiver latency."}

We detected no High or Medium findings in the V1 deployment; misses concentrated in specification details and implicit assumptions (57.1 percent), timing and concurrency issues (28.6 percent), and external library dependencies (14.3 percent). Our improved agent, evaluated against the ground truth of a competitive audit, achieved a strict recall of 27.3 percent on high-impact vulnerabilities, placing it in the top 4 percent of human auditors and outperforming 49 of 51 contestants on critical issues. These results, though from a single deployment, suggest that early, explicit threat modeling is essential for reducing false positives and focusing agentic auditing effort. The agent-driven process enables expert validation and submission in about 40 minutes on average."}

However, the decentralized optimization of SR parameters -- transmission power and Carrier Sensing Threshold (CST) -- across different Basic Service Sets (BSSs) is challenging due to the lack of global state information. In addition, the concurrent operation of multiple agents creates a highly non-stationary environment, often resulting in suboptimal global configurations (e.g., using the maximum possible transmission power by default). To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a decentralized learning algorithm based on regret-matching, grounded in internal regret minimization. Unlike standard decentralized ``selfish'' approaches that often converge to inefficient Nash Equilibria (NE), internal regret minimization guides competing agents toward Correlated Equilibria (CE), effectively mimicking coordination without explicit communication. Through simulation results, we showcase the superiority of our proposed approach and its ability to reach near-optimal global performance. These results confirm the not-yet-unleashed potential of scalable decentralized solutions and question the need for the heavy signaling overheads and architectural complexity associated with emerging centralized solutions like Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC)."}

Providing patients with estimates of their expected real-time length of stay (RT-LOS), generated as a function of the operational state of the healthcare facility at their anticipated time of arrival (as opposed to estimates of average LOS), can help them make informed decisions regarding which facility to visit within a network. In this study, we develop a healthcare facility assignment (HFA) algorithm that assigns healthcare facilities to patients using RT-LOS predictions at facilities within the network of interest. We describe the generation of RT-LOS predictions via two methodologies: (a) an analytical queuing-theoretic approach, and (b) a hybrid simulation-driven machine learning approach. Because RT-LOS predictors are highly specific to the queuing system in question, we illustrate the development of RT-LOS predictors using both approaches by considering the outpatient experience at primary health centers. Via computational experiments, we compare outcomes from the implementation of the RT-HFA algorithm with both RT-LOS predictors to the case where patients visit the facility of their choice. Computational experiments also indicated that the RT-HFA algorithm substantially reduced patient wait times and LOS at congested facilities and led to more equitable utilization of medical resources at facilities across the network. Finally, we show numerically that the effectiveness of the RT-HFA algorithm in improving outcomes is contingent on the level of compliance with the assignment decision."}

We propose two complementary architectures: DeepVLF-R, where termination is receiver-driven, and DeepVLF-T, where the transmitter controls termination. Both architectures leverage bit-group partitioning and transformer-based encoder-decoder networks to enable fine-grained rate adaptation in response to feedback. Evaluations over AWGN and 5G-NR fading channels demonstrate that DeepVLF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art learned feedback codes. It achieves the same block error rate with 20%-55% fewer channel uses and lowers error floors by orders of magnitude, particularly in high-rate regimes. Encoding dynamics analysis further reveals that the models autonomously learn a two-phase strategy analogous to classical Schalkwijk-Kailath coding: an initial information-carrying phase followed by a noise-cancellation refinement phase. This emergent behavior underscores the interpretability and information-theoretic alignment of the learned codes."}

We show that every delay-Doppler domain symbol undergoes the same effective channel response under the discrete oversampled Zak-OTFS.

Meanwhile, IPv6's massive address space breaks per-IP reputation and makes many defenses either non-scalable or narrowly scoped (e.g., only internal threats, only RA abuse, or only volumetric floods). We propose a zero-trust edge architecture implemented in a single programmable data-plane pipeline that unifies four modules: external spoofing, internal spoofing, external flooding, and internal flooding. A key design choice is to enforce identity plausibility before rate plausibility: stateless per-packet validation filters spoofed traffic early so that time-window statistics for flooding operate on credible identities. We outline a concrete P4 design (prefix Hop-Limit bands, DAD-anchored address-port bindings, and Count-Min Sketch windowed counting) and evaluate it across a systematic 15-scenario suite spanning single-, dual-, and multi-vector compositions. We report results from a BMv2 prototype and validate the same pipeline on a Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC, and we discuss limitations and open directions."}

Existing protocol-driven defenses and prior academic solutions largely assume stable identifiers or predictable beaconing.

AirCatch advances the state of the art along three axes: (i) a novel, modulation-aware CFO fingerprint that augments packet-level CFO with content-independent CFO components that amplify device distinctiveness; (ii) a new tracking detection algorithm based on high core density and persistence that is robust to contamination and evasion through per-identifier segmentation; and (iii) an ultra-low-cost receiver, an approximately 10 dollar BLE SDR named BlePhasyr, built from commodity components, that makes RF fingerprinting based detection practical in resource-constrained deployments. We evaluate AirCatch across Apple, Google, Tile, and Samsung tag families in multi-hour captures, systematically stress-test evasion using a scenario generator over a grid of transmission and rotation periods, and validate in diverse real-world mobility traces including home and office commutes, public transport, car travel, and airport journeys while sweeping background tag density. Across these stress tests, AirCatch achieves no false positives and early detection over a wide range of adversarial configurations and environments, degrading gracefully only in extreme low-rate regimes that also reduce attacker utility."}

Numerous methods have been proposed to jointly optimize key performance metrics such as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and Cramér-Rao bound. However, the computational complexity of these methods often grows rapidly with the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). To tackle this challenge, we prove a fundamental structural property of the ISAC beamforming problem, i.e., there exists an optimal solution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure. This leads to an equivalent reformulation of the problem with dimension related to the number of users rather than the number of BS antennas, thereby enabling the development of low-complexity algorithms. When applying the interior-point method to the reformulated problem, we achieve up to six orders of magnitude in complexity reduction when the number of antennas exceeds the number of users by an order of magnitude. To further reduce the complexity, we develop a balanced augmented Lagrangian method to solve the reformulated problem. The proposed algorithm maintains optimality while achieving a computational complexity that scales quartically with the number of users. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed R-BAL method can achieve a speedup of more than 10000$\\times$ over the conventional IPM in massive MIMO scenarios."}

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks."}

This paper addresses the fundamental question: Can arbitrary electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays achieve unambiguous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization when element spacing exceeds $λ/2$? We provide an affirmative answer by exploiting the multi-component structure of EMVS measurements and developing a synergistic estimation and optimization framework for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bistatic multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. A third-order parallel factor (PARAFAC) model is constructed from EMVS observations, enabling natural separation of spatial, polarimetric, and propagation effects via the trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. A novel phase-disambiguation procedure leverages rotational invariance across the six electromagnetic components of EMVSs to resolve $2π$ phase wrapping in arbitrary array geometries, allowing unambiguous joint estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) direction of departure (DOD), two-dimensional direction of arrival (DOA), and polarization parameters with automatic pairing. To support localization in NLOS environments and enhance estimation robustness, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is incorporated and its phase shifts are optimized via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to maximize received signal power, improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and further suppressing spatial ambiguities through iterative refinement."}

In this case, how to fully utilize the spatial resources by designing the transmit beamforming such that both sensing and communication can achieve satisfactory performance statistically is a difficult problem, which motivates the study in this paper. Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations. Furthermore, due to the need to cater to multiple target/user locations, we investigate whether dynamically employing different beamforming designs over different time slots improves the performance. It is proven that using a static beamforming strategy is sufficient for achieving the optimal performance. Numerical results validate our analysis, show that ISAC performance improves as the target/user location distributions become similar, and provide useful insights on the BS-user/-target association strategy."}

LDME is organized in three layers: (i) dual-path denoising (DWT with adaptive Savitzky-Golay smoothing) to suppress broadband noise while preserving transient fault structure; (ii) multi-scale damage enhancement using a Teager-Kaiser pre-amplifier followed by a Hadamard-Caputo fractional operator that accentuates non-sinusoidal, low-frequency fault signatures; and (iii) decision fusion, where harmonics-aware Fourier indicators are combined and scored by an unsupervised anomaly detector.

To address the above concerns, intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be used to defend against malicious aircraft intrusions in LAE. Whereas, due to the heterogeneous data, dynamic environment, and resource-constrained devices within LAE, current IDS face challenges in detection accuracy, adaptability, and resource utilization ratio. In this regard, due to the inherent ability to combine the strengths of multiple models, ensemble learning can realize more robust and diverse anomaly detection further enhance IDS accuracy, thereby improving robustness and efficiency of the secure LAE.

This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP.

In practical deployments, CKM observations are often noisy and irregular due to coverage-induced sparsity and hardware-induced linear/nonlinear degradations. Conventional end-to-end algorithms couple CKM prior information with task- and device-specific observations, and require labeled data and separate training for each construction configuration, which is expensive and therefore incompatible with scalable edge deployments. Motivated by the trends toward cloud-edge collaboration and the Artificial Intelligence - Radio Access Network (AI-RAN) paradigm, we develop a cloud-edge collaborative framework for scalable CKM construction, which enables knowledge sharing across tasks, devices, and regions by explicitly decoupling a generalizable CKM prior from the information provided by local observations. A foundation model is trained once in the cloud using unlabeled data to learn a generalizable CKM prior. During inference, edge nodes combine the shared prior with local observations. Experiments on the CKMImageNet dataset show that the proposed method achieves competitive construction accuracy while substantially reducing training cost and data requirements, mitigating negative transfer, and offering clear advantages in generalization and deployment scalability."}

Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost."}

This paper proposes a two-stage near-ML decoding framework that applies to any linear block code. In the first stage, we run a low-complexity decoder to produce a candidate codeword and a cyclic redundancy check. When this stage succeeds, we terminate immediately. When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder attains near-ML performance for short-blocklength, low-rate codes while maintaining low decoding latency."}

The objective is to flatten the total load curve seen by the distribution transformer by restricting the times at which the available flexible loads are allowed to operate, subject to the flexibility constraints of the loads to preserve customers' comfort. The original scheme was tested in a real-world setup, considering both winter and summer days. The pilot results confirmed the technical feasibility but also informed the design of an improved version of the controller. Computer simulations using the adjusted controller show that, compared to the original formulation, the improved scheme achieves greater peak reductions in summer. Additionally, comparisons were made with an ideal controller, which assumes perfect knowledge of the inflexible load profile, the models of the controlled devices, the hot water and space heating demand, and future electric vehicle charging sessions. The proposed scheme with limited information achieves almost half of the potential average daily peak reduction that the ideal controller with perfect knowledge would achieve."}

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents."}

This work proposes a privacy-preserving gesture-based covert communication system that ensures, no raw sensor signals, learned features, or classification outputs are exposed to any third-party. The system employs a multi-party homomorphic learning pipeline for gesture recognition directly over encrypted motion data, preventing adversaries from inferring gesture semantics, replaying sensor traces, or accessing intermediate representations. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply encrypted gesture recognition in a wearable-based covert communication setting. We design and evaluate haptic and visual feedback mechanisms for covert signal delivery and evaluate the system using 600 gesture samples from a commodity smartwatch, achieving over 94.44% classification accuracy and demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system with practical deployability from high-performance systems to resource-constrained edge devices."}

Motivated by the long-standing practice of neglecting transient tire dynamics in vehicle modeling and control, a rigorous justification is provided for such simplifications using singular perturbation theory. A perturbation parameter, defined as the ratio between a characteristic rolling contact length and the vehicle's longitudinal speed, is introduced to formalize the time-scale separation between rigid-body motion and tire dynamics. For sufficiently small values of this parameter, it is demonstrated that standard finite-dimensional techniques can be applied to analyze the local stability of equilibria and to design stabilizing controllers. Both state-feedback and output-feedback designs are considered, under standard stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Whilst the proposed controllers follow classical approaches, the novelty of the work lies in establishing the first mathematical framework that rigorously connects distributed tire models with conventional vehicle dynamics. The results reconcile decades of empirical findings with a formal theoretical foundation and open new perspectives for the analysis and control of ODE-PDE systems with distributed friction in automotive applications."}

The objective function consists of a combination of smoothness measures across all considered simplicial levels, allowing for the incorporation of arbitrary smoothness criteria.

Existing access control is static and centralized, unable to adapt to insider threats or evolving contexts. Blockchain improves decentralization but lacks behavioral intelligence, while centralized machine learning for anomaly detection requires aggregating sensitive data, violating privacy.\n  The proposed solution is ICBAC, an intelligent contract-based access control framework. It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.\n  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing. ICBAC thus offers a practical, scalable solution for dynamic, privacy-preserving access control in decentralized supply chains."}

In this formulation, vertices represent candidate codewords and edges connect pairs whose longest common subsequence (LCS) distance guarantees correction of up to $d$ deletions. A valid codebook corresponds to a clique in the resulting graph, and finding the largest codebook is equivalent to identifying a maximum clique. While MCP-based formulations for deletion-correcting codes have previously been explored, we demonstrate that applying Penalty-Guided Clique Search (PGCS), a lightweight stochastic clique-search heuristic inspired by Dynamic Local Search (DLS), consistently yields larger codebooks than existing graph-based heuristics, including minimum-degree and coloring methods, for block lengths $n = 8,9,\\dots,14$ and deletion parameters $d = 1,2,3$. In several finite-length regimes, the resulting codebooks match known optimal sizes and outperform classical constructions such as Helberg codes. For decoding under segmented reception, where codeword boundaries are known, we propose an optimized LCS-based decoder that exploits symbol-count filtering and early termination to substantially reduce the number of LCS evaluations while preserving exact decoding guarantees.

This approach effectively separates real secrets from false positives and achieves an F1-score of 92.70\\% on a benchmark dataset, outperforming traditional regex-based scanners. \\textsc{IssueGuard} integrates directly into the web interface and continuously analyzes the issue editor, presenting clear visual warnings to help users avoid submitting sensitive data.

However, the rapid growth of terrestrial devices intensifies spectrum sharing between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments, resulting in severe cross-tier interference. In particular, frequency sharing between the HAPS satellite uplink and HAPS ground downlink improves spectrum efficiency but suffers from interference caused by the HAPS antenna back-lobe. Existing approaches relying on zero-forcing (ZF) codebooks have limited performance under highly dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this limitation, we employ a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided HAPS-based SAGIN framework with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The proposed DDPG framework optimizes the HAPS beamforming weights to form spatial nulls toward interference sources while maintaining robust links to the desired signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG framework consistently outperforms conventional ZF beamforming among different RIS configurations, achieving up to \\(11.3\\%\\) throughput improvement for a \\(4\\times4\\) RIS configuration, validating its adaptive capability to enhance spectral efficiency in dynamic HAPS-based SAGINs."}

To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling.

We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+)."}

Two passive sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic Doppler frequencies of the target UAV at different directions according to downlink signals transmitted from their corresponding BSs, such that the velocities of the UAV versus time can be estimated. Hence, the trajectories of the target UAV can be reconstructed. Although both the target UAV and the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating BSs, it is demonstrated by experiments that the tracking errors are below 50 centimeters for 90% of the complicated trajectories, when the distances between the UAV and sensing receivers are less than 30 meters.

Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy. Our work demonstrates that LM watermarking is fundamentally a channel coding problem, paving the way for principled coding-theoretic approaches to watermark design."}

This paper investigates safe reinforcement learning (RL) for hy draulic force control with real-world training using contraction metric certificates. A data-driven model of a hydraulic actuator, identified from experimental data, is employed for simulation based pretraining of a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy that adapts the PI gains of a feedback-linearization (FL) controller. To reduce instability during online training, we propose a quadratic-programming (QP) contraction filter that leverages a learned contraction metric to enforce approximate exponential convergence of trajectories, applying minimal corrections to the policy output. The approach is validated on a hydraulic test bench, where the RL controller is trained directly on hardware and benchmarked against a simulation-trained agent and a fixed-gain baseline. Experimental results show that real-hardware training improves force-tracking performance compared to both alternatives, while the contraction filter mitigates chattering and instabilities. These findings suggest that contraction-based certificates can enable safe RL in high force hydraulic systems, though robustness at extreme operating conditions remains a challenge."}

LocDreamer learns a WM that captures the latent representation of the target motion and localization environment, thereby generating synthetic measurements to imagine arbitrary anchor deployments. These measurements enable imagination-driven training of both the tracking model and the reinforcement learning (RL)-based anchor scheduler that activates only the most informative anchors, which significantly reduce energy and signaling costs while preserving high tracking accuracy.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated theorem proving increasingly feasible. However, most prior work focuses on mathematics-oriented benchmarks such as miniF2F, with limited evaluation on real-world verification projects. The few studies that consider industrial-scale verification mostly rely on closed-source models with hundreds of billions of parameters, which cannot be locally deployed and incur substantial usage costs. In this paper, we propose AutoReal, an LLM-driven theorem proving method for real-world industrial-scale systems with support for lightweight local deployment. We evaluate AutoReal on the seL4-Isabelle verification project as a representative and challenging case study. AutoReal incorporates two key improvements: (1) chain-of-thought (CoT)-based proof training, which teaches the LLM the reasoning behind proof steps and enables step-wise explanations alongside proofs, and (2) context augmentation, which leverages proof context from the project to enhance LLM-driven proving. Based on the AutoReal methodology, we fine-tune a base model to obtain AutoReal-Prover, a compact 7B-scale prover for industrial-scale theorem proving. AutoReal-Prover achieves a 51.67% proof success rate on 660 theorems from seL4-designated Important Theories across all 10 seL4 proof categories, substantially outperforming prior attempts on seL4 (27.06%). To evaluate generalization, we further apply AutoReal-Prover to three security-related projects from the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP), covering all 451 theorems and achieving a proof success rate of 53.88%.

Vehicle trajectories derived from the Highway Drone (HighD) and Intersection Drone (InD) datasets are converted into simulation-ready formats and coupled with a standardized V2X networking stack to enable message-level performance analysis for entire traffic populations comprising over hundred thousands vehicles across multiple locations. We evaluate key V2X performance indicators, including inter-generation gap, inter-packet gap, packet delivery ratio, and channel busy ratio, across both highway and urban intersection environments. Our results show that cooperative awareness services remain feasible at scale under realistic traffic conditions. In addition, the findings highlight how traffic density, mobility patterns, and communication range influence V2X performance and how synthetic traffic assumptions may overestimate channel congestion."}

We then introduce its applications in advanced wireless communications, showing how constrained problems are reformulated on their natural manifolds and solved using tailored RMO algorithms.

However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability."}

In contrast to prior studies that assume a fixed SF channel, we note that the SF channel is configurable, as its characteristics are shaped by various transmission and reception strategies, such as power allocation. Based on this observation, we formulate the SF channel optimization problem under a mutual information constraint between the SFs and their reconstructions, and analytically derive the optimal SF channel under a linear encoder-decoder structure and Gaussian source assumption.

We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.\n  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.\n  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead.

This raises a fundamental question: which models should be selected when forming an LLM ensemble? We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews. Across all datasets, we observe that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under the same query budget."}

However, when the number of beams is large, the existing MAB algorithms are characterized by long exploration times, resulting in poor overall communication throughput. In this work, we propose augmenting the upper confidence bound (UCB) based MAB with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to address this limitation. The premise of the work is that the radar and communication functionalities share the same field-of-view and that communication mobile users are detected by the radar as mobile targets. The radar information is used for significantly reducing the number of candidate beams for the UCB, resulting in an overall reduction in the exploration time. Further, the radar information is used to estimate the realignment time in quasi-stationary scenarios. We have realized the MAB and radar signal processing algorithms on the system on chip (SoC) via hardware-software co-design (HSCD) and fixed-point analysis. We demonstrate the significant gain in execution time using accelerators. The simulations consider complex propagation channels involving direct and multipath, with simple and extended radar targets in the presence of significant static clutter. The resulting experiments show that the proposed ISAC-based MAB achieves a 35% reduction in the overall exploration time and 1.4 factor higher throughput as compared to the conventional MAB that is based only on communications."}

MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L$^3$), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L$^3$ learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L$^3$ on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods."}

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline."}

This work tests ML algorithms in detecting malicious code from dynamic execution characteristics. For this purpose, the CICMalDroid2020 dataset, composed of dynamically obtained Android malware behavior samples, was used with the algorithms XGBoost, Naıve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Random Forest (RF). The study focused on empirically evaluating the impact of the SMOTE technique, used to mitigate class imbalance in the data, on the performance of these models. The results indicate that, in 75% of the tested configurations, the application of SMOTE led to performance degradation or only marginal improvements, with an average loss of 6.14 percentage points. Tree-based algorithms, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperformed the others, achieving weighted recall above 94%. It is inferred that SMOTE, although widely used, did not prove beneficial for Android malware detection in the CICMalDroid2020 dataset, possibly due to the complexity and sparsity of dynamic characteristics or the nature of malicious relationships.

However, structured beam schemes based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs) fail to fully exploit the array aperture, thereby limiting their topological reconfigurability and adaptability to diverse communication scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications."}

We present CryptoGen, the first system to enable scalable privacy-preserving neural generation with persistent encrypted key-value (KV) cache reuse. Discriminative-task secure inference systems incur quadratic latency and memory growth when adapted to autoregressive decoding due to the lack of native encrypted KV-cache support. In contrast, CryptoGen achieves near-linear scaling by securely reusing and updating encrypted KV caches throughout generation. CryptoGen integrates homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to support both prefilling and generation. Key techniques include a unified encrypted KV-cache framework, heterogeneous SIMD encodings for different phases, optimized cipher-cipher matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations, and efficient noise refresh and ciphertext concatenation mechanisms. Evaluation on generative Transformer models trained on WikiText-2, PTB, and LAMBADA shows that for input lengths of 128-512 tokens, CryptoGen achieves 4.4x-7.6x lower per-token latency than state-of-the-art discriminative secure inference systems, while maintaining near-linear latency and memory scaling, with advantages increasing for longer sequences.

In order to study the maximum data rate that is feasible in such kind of OCC systems, this paper presents its equivalent digital communication system model in which the rolling-shutter camera is modeled as a rectangular matched-filter whose time width is equal to the exposure time of the camera, followed by a sampling process at the pixel row sweep rate of the camera. Based on the proposed rolling-shutter camera model, the maximum symbol rate that such OCC systems can support is experimentally demonstrated, and the impact of imperfect time synchronization between the VLC transmitter and the rolling-shutter OCC receiver is characterized in the form of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). The equivalent three-tap channel model that results from this process is experimentally validated and the generated ISI is compensated with the use of linear equalization in reception. Simulation and experimental results show a strong correlation between them, demonstrating that the proposed approach can be used to make the OCC system work at the Nyquist sampling rate, which is equivalent to the pixel row sweep rate of the rolling-shutter camera used in reception."}

The goal of this paper is to reevaluate the PAKE model by noting that the absence of a PKI -- or, more generally, of a mechanism aside from the password for authenticating the server -- makes such protocols vulnerable to reverse online guessing attacks, in which an adversary attempts to validate password guesses by impersonating a server. While their logic is similar to traditional guessing, where the attacker impersonates a client, reverse guessing poses a unique risk because the burden of detection is shifted to the clients, rendering existing defenses against traditional guessing moot. Our results demonstrate that reverse guessing is particularly effective when an adversary attacks clients indiscriminately, such as in phishing or password-spraying attacks, or for applications with automated login processes or a universal password, such as WPA3-SAE. Our analysis suggests that stakeholders should, by default, authenticate the server using more stringent measures than just the user's password, and that a password-only mode of operation should be a last resort against catastrophic security failures when other authentication mechanisms are not available."}

In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats.

However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems."}

Nevertheless, SemComs rely heavily on the utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) at the transceivers, which limit the accuracy between the original and reconstructed data and are challenging to implement in practice due to increased architecture complexity. Thus, hybrid cellular networks that utilize both conventional bit communications (BitComs) and SemComs have been introduced to bridge the gap between required and existing infrastructure. To facilitate such networks, in this work, we investigate reliability by deriving closed-form expressions for the outage probability of the network. Additionally, we propose a generalized outage probability through which the cell radius that achieves a desired outage threshold for a specific range of users is calculated in closed form. Additionally, to consider the practical limitations caused by the specialized dedicated hardware and the increased memory and computational resources that are required to support SemCom, a semantic utilization metric is proposed. Based on this metric, we express the probability that a specific number of users select SemCom transmission and calculate the optimal cell radius for that number in closed form. Simulation results validate the derived analytical expressions and the characterized design properties of the cell radius found through the proposed metrics, providing useful insights."}

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

However, these features are inevitably obscured by noise, leading to uncertainty in estimating both signal levels and transition points. Traditional frequency-domain filtering is ineffective for denoising stepwise signals, as edge-related high-frequency components strongly overlap with noise. Although Hidden Markov Model-based approaches are widely used, they rely on stationarity assumptions and are not specifically designed for signal denoising. Here, we propose a diffusion model-based algorithm for stepwise signal denoising, named the Stepwise Signal Diffusion Model (SSDM). During training, SSDM learns the statistical structure of stepwise signals via a forward diffusion process that progressively adds noise. In the following reverse process, the model reconstructs clean signals from noisy observations, integrating a multi-scale convolutional network with an attention mechanism. Training data are generated by simulating stepwise signals through a Markov process with additive Gaussian noise. Across a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios, SSDM consistently outperforms traditional methods in both signal level reconstruction and transition point detection. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated on experimental data from single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and nanopore DNA translocation measurements. Overall, SSDM provides a general and robust framework for recovering stepwise signals in various single-molecule detections and other physical systems exhibiting discrete state transitions."}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE."}

We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels."}

However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability."}

Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph.

Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations. Furthermore, due to the need to cater to multiple target/user locations, we investigate whether dynamically employing different beamforming designs over different time slots improves the performance. It is proven that using a static beamforming strategy is sufficient for achieving the optimal performance.

We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.

This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP.

When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized.

We propose \\textsc{FreqLens}, an interpretable forecasting framework that discovers and attributes predictions to learnable frequency components. \\textsc{FreqLens} introduces two key innovations: (1) \\emph{learnable frequency discovery} -- frequency bases are parameterized via sigmoid mapping and learned from data with diversity regularization, enabling automatic discovery of dominant periodic patterns without domain knowledge; and (2) \\emph{axiomatic frequency attribution} -- a theoretically grounded framework that provably satisfies Completeness, Faithfulness, Null-Frequency, and Symmetry axioms, with per-frequency attributions equivalent to Shapley values. On Traffic and Weather datasets, \\textsc{FreqLens} achieves competitive or superior performance while discovering physically meaningful frequencies: all 5 independent runs discover the 24-hour daily cycle ($24.6 \\pm 0.1$h, 2.5\\% error) and 12-hour half-daily cycle ($11.8 \\pm 0.1$h, 1.6\\% error) on Traffic, and weekly cycles ($10\\times$ longer than the input window) on Weather. These results demonstrate genuine frequency-level knowledge discovery with formal theoretical guarantees on attribution quality."}
