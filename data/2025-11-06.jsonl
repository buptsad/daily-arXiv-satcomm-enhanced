Conventional artifact removal methods\nrequire manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during\nfiltering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),\nhave shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack\nintegrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally\nintensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nEEGReXferNet, a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG subspace reconstruction\nvia cross-subject transfer learning - developed using Keras TensorFlow\n(v2.15.1). EEGReXferNet employs a modular architecture that leverages volume\nconduction across neighboring channels, band-specific convolution encoding, and\ndynamic latent feature extraction through sliding windows. By integrating\nreference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive\nwindows and generalizes effectively across subjects.

Low-cost cardiac intelligence (LCCI) offers a\npromising alternative by using wearable device data, such as 1-lead\nelectrocardiogram (ECG), but it suffers from a significant diagnostic\nperformance gap compared to high-cost cardiac intelligence (HCCI). To bridge\nthis gap, we propose LiteHeart, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation\nframework. LiteHeart introduces a region-aware distillation module to mimic how\ncardiologists focus on diagnostically relevant ECG regions and a cross-layer\nmutual information module to align the decision processes of LCCI and HCCI\nsystems. Using a semi-supervised training strategy, LiteHeart further improves\nmodel robustness under limited supervision. Evaluated on five datasets covering\nover 38 cardiovascular diseases, LiteHeart substantially reduces the\nperformance gap between LCCI and HCCI, outperforming existing methods by 4.27%\nto 7.10% in macro F1 score. These results demonstrate that LiteHeart\nsignificantly enhances the diagnostic capabilities of low-cost cardiac\nintelligence systems, paving the way for scalable, affordable, and accurate\ndaily cardiac healthcare using wearable technologies."}

Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the\nnatural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing\nonly a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous\nlocations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring\nboth the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach."}

While many methods infer static\ncausal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where\nrelationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics\nrequires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning\nmethod for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler\nand Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic\nrepresentations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive\nDependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing\ndatapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits\na unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal\ncausality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human\nmotion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,\ntime-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena."}

Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms.
