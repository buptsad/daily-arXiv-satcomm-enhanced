Abstract: Vision-aided wireless sensing is emerging as a cornerstone of 6G mobile computing. While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit outlier hypothesis testing and propose exponentially consistent, low-complexity fixed-length tests that achieve a better tradeoff between detection performance and computational complexity than existing exhaustive-search methods. In this setting, the goal is to identify outlying sequences from a set of observed sequences, where most sequences are i.i.d. from a nominal distribution and outliers are i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. While prior work has primarily focused on discrete-valued sequences, we extend the results of Bu et al. (TSP 2019) to continuous-valued sequences and develop a distribution-free test based on the MMD metric. Our framework handles both known and unknown numbers of outliers. In the unknown-count case, we bound the detection performance and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of three types of error probabilities. Finally, we quantify the performance penalty incurred when the number of outliers is unknown.

Abstract: This paper introduces an interference-free multi-stream transmission architecture leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), from a new perspective of interference exploitation. Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Result: 在模拟中，相比单 IRS 与分布式多 IRS，系统安全率提升分别达 32.0% 与 22.3%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种针对宽带 MIMO-OFDM 的协同双 IRS 协助方案，并通过流形梯度下降算法实现了安全率的显著提升。

Abstract: Cooperative double intelligent reflecting surface (double-IRS) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in MIMO systems. However, existing studies are limited to narrowband scenarios and fail to address wideband MIMO-OFDM. In this regime, frequency-flat IRS phases and cascaded IRS links cause severe coupling, rendering narrowband designs inapplicable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively resolves the OFDM coupling issue and achieves significant secrecy rate gains, outperforming single-IRS and distributed multi-IRS benchmarks by 32.0% and 22.3%, respectively.

Abstract: Queue management and resource allocation play a critical role in enabling cooperative status awareness in vehicular networks. This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware status updates in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, where each vehicle's status is represented by multiple interdependent packets. To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces average AoI across a wide range of network densities, channel conditions, and traffic loads, consistently outperforming several baselines.

TL;DR: 设计鲁棒RIS，在有限块长的机器通信场景下通过SCO算法最大化加权和速率，对抗信道误差，实验验证了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模机器型通信+场景下，短数据包传输、有限编码块长和信道估计误差严重抑制系统性能，需设计新的技术提升信道条件不佳时的增益。

Method: 先构造一个能最大化加权和速率(WSR)的可重构智能表面(RIS)响应，利用凹性上界与逼近把原始非凸问题转化为可求解的凸问题，随后采用连续逼近优化(SCO)算法对RIS参数进行迭代求解。

Result: 数值仿真表明，SCO方案能够在保持低复杂度的同时显著提升WSR，并在存在信道估计误差的场景中展现鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种鲁棒RIS优化框架，利用SCO有效解决了有限块长环境下的非凸WSR优化问题，证明了RIS在大规模机器通信中的性能提升潜力。

Abstract: Within the context of massive machine-type communications+, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising technology to boost system performance in scenarios with poor channel conditions. Considering single-antenna sensors transmitting short data packets to a multiple-antenna collector node, we introduce and design an RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system working in the finite blocklength regime. Due to the large number of reflecting elements and their passive nature, channel estimation errors may occur. In this letter, we then propose a robust RIS optimization to combat such a detrimental issue. Based on concave bounds and approximations, the nonconvex WSR problem for the RIS response is addressed via successive convex optimization (SCO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and complexity of the SCO solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CRB受限于等/不等式约束、流形结构或Fisher信息矩阵非奇异，而实际问题中约束往往更复杂。

Method: 基于切锥几何分析，将约束集的切锥扩展到任何约束形状，利用该几何结构推导出通用CRB。

Result: 得到的CRB一致涵盖并统一了已知特殊情况，适用于任何偏差与Fisher信息矩阵。

Conclusion: 提出了针对任意约束集合参数的CRB，可以应用于任何估计偏差和Fisher信息矩阵，并通过切锥推导出最小均方误差上限。

Abstract: This paper presents a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation of parameters confined to an arbitrary set. Unlike existing results that rely on equality or inequality constraints, manifold structures, or the nonsingularity of the Fisher information matrix, the derived CRB applies to any constrained set and holds for any estimation bias and any Fisher information matrix. The key geometric object governing the new CRB is the tangent cone to the constraint set, whose span determines how the constraints affect the estimation accuracy. This CRB subsumes, unifies, and generalizes known special cases, offering an intuitive and broadly applicable framework to characterize the minimum mean-square error of constrained estimators.

Abstract: This paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to support parameter estimation in machine-type communications (MTC). We focus on a network where single-antenna sensors transmit spatially correlated measurements to a multiple-antenna collector node (CN) via non-orthogonal multiple access. We propose an estimation scheme based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) exposure compliance has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of communications terminal designs. However, accurately assessing the impact of EM exposure for proper design strategies remains challenging. In this paper, we develop a long-term thermal EM exposure constraint model and propose a novel adaptive exposure-aware beamforming design for an mmWave uplink system. Specifically, we first establish an equivalent channel model based on Maxwell's radiation equations, which accurately captures the EM physical effects. Then, we derive a closed-form thermal impulse response model from the Pennes bioheat transfer equation (BHTE), characterizing the thermal inertia of tissue. Inspired by this model, we formulate a beamforming optimization problem that translates rigid instantaneous exposure limits into a flexible long-term thermal budget constraint. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online beamforming algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization theory, obtaining a closed-form near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively stabilizes tissue temperature near a predefined safety threshold and significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with instantaneous exposure constraints.

Conclusion: 通过非接触、实战环境下的实验证明，恶性结肠肿瘤的发电参数显著高于正常组织，并随肿瘤分期递增；未来可用于腔道内部病变测量新技术的设计。

Abstract: The dielectric characterization of human tissues can play a crucial role in the development of new medical diagnostic tools. In particular, the characterization of healthy and pathological tissues can provide vital information for diagnosis. In this paper, preliminary results from a small-scale measurement campaign conducted in 0.5-26.5GHz during real surgeries on healthy and malignant human colon tissues are presented. Those measurements were carried out externally to the colon, without direct contact to the tumor growing inside the colon. Furthermore, different tumor stages are taken into account. Initial findings reveal that advanced tumor stages are related with increased higher values of dielectric properties in malignant tumor tissues compared to the healthy ones.

TL;DR: 通过$S$-矩阵建模随机失真，利用HT结构和GLS校准，提升恶劣天气下的DoA估计与雷达性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气导致的多重散射产生随机失真，破坏阵列测距精度，亟需鲁棒的DoA估计方案。

Method: 利用物理基础的$S$-矩阵模型刻画随机相位幅度失真，构建包含失真效应的测量框架；借助手柄Toeplitz结构降低参数维度，采用广义最小二乘法进行标定。

Result: 仿真验证显示该方法显著抑制雨引起的失真，提升DoA精度与雷达探测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效抑制雨诱发的相位和幅度失真，显著提升恶劣天气下的方向估计精度与雷达性能。

Abstract: We investigate robust direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation for sensor arrays operating in adverse weather conditions, where weather-induced distortions degrade estimation accuracy. Building on a physics-based $S$-matrix model established in prior work, we adopt a statistical characterization of random phase and amplitude distortions caused by multiple scattering in rain. Based on this model, we develop a measurement framework for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) that explicitly incorporates such distortions. To mitigate their impact, we exploit the Hermitian Toeplitz (HT) structure of the covariance matrix to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. We then apply a generalized least squares (GLS) approach for calibration. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively suppresses rain-induced distortions, improves DoA estimation accuracy, and enhances radar sensing performance in challenging weather conditions.

Motivation: 在ITS场景下，传统信道估计需高额导频开销，亟需低开销、高精度的信道跟踪技术以提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出一种低开销的MAP概率信道跟踪方法，能够在ITS集成的基站中精确跟踪主要LOS链路，实现与完美信道知识相近的频谱效率。

Abstract: This paper considers an intelligent transmitting surface (ITS) integrated into a base station and develops a low-overhead maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability channel tracking method for the dominant line-of-sight link between the ITS and the user equipment. We cast the per-block channel as a three-parameter model consisting of the channel amplitude, channel phase, and angle-of-arrival at the ITS. We exploit temporal correlation by updating the priors using the estimates from the previous block. Using only two pilots per coherence block alongside a targeted beam alignment strategy, the proposed method achieves precise channel tracking and attains spectral efficiency close to that achievable under perfect channel knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G NR仍主导的6G研发阶段，如何在不完全转向DDMC波形的情况下，利用已有OFDM/DFT-s-OFDM信号实现高多普勒环境下的优越性能。

Method: 采用DFT-s-OFDM接收机将每个OFDM符号映射至DD域，估计延迟-多普勒通道参数，并利用已解码的数据以线性方式逐步更新通道估计，实现通道预测与等化的联合处理。

Result: 与传统频域估计相比，所提方法在误码率和NMSE上均实现了显著提升；只需使用两帧SRS初始估计，即可实现超过25个OFDM符号的无载波检测。

Conclusion: 本研究通过在现有5G NR DFT-s-OFDM框架下实现延迟-多普勒域（DD）估计与多维等化，成功实现了在高移动性环境下的无载波检测，并显著提升了误码率和归一化均方误差，证明了DD域处理在6G预期应用中的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Delay-Doppler multicarrier modulation (DDMC) techniques have been among the central topics of research for high-Doppler channels. However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决在Ambient Assisted Living环境下，mmWave雷达出现检测的可解释性问题。相机传感存在隐私顾虑，故需要一种无需摄像头的解释式检测方法。

Method: 提出Generative Latent Alignment（GLA）框架：1）使用轻量级卷积变分自编码器（VAE）对雷达 Range-Angle（RA）热图进行低维编码；2）把冷冻的 CLIP 文本编码器作为语义锚，分别对应"empty room"与"person present"；3）在对齐后的潜在空间中使用 Grad-CAM 可视化支持各类检测判定的空间区域。

Result: 在毫米波雷达数据集上定性验证："person present" 类生成紧凑的 Grad-CAM 斑点，与强RA回波位置一致；"empty room" 则产生扩散或无证据的映射；使用无关文本提示的消融实验显示重建和定位性能下降，说明雷达特定锚的重要性。

Conclusion: 将雷达信号的低维潜在表示与语义锚点软对齐，并在该潜在空间中应用 Grad-CAM，可实现对mmWave雷达出现检测的可解释可视化，且该方法能够显著区分空房与有人状态。

Abstract: In this work, we study how to make mmWave radar presence detection more interpretable for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) settings, where camera-based sensing raises privacy concerns. We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to "empty room" and "person present", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the "person present" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas "empty room" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task-agnostic discovery layer for multivariate time series that constructs a relational hypothesis graph over entities without assuming linearity, stationarity, or a downstream objective. The method learns window-level sequence representations using an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, aggregates these representations into entity-level embeddings, and induces a sparse similarity network by thresholding a latent-space similarity measure. This network is intended as an analyzable abstraction that compresses the pairwise search space and exposes candidate relationships for further investigation, rather than as a model optimized for prediction, trading, or any decision rule. The framework is demonstrated on a challenging real-world dataset of hourly cryptocurrency returns, illustrating how latent similarity induces coherent network structure; a classical econometric relation is also reported as an external diagnostic lens to contextualize discovered edges.

Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

*Alejandro Ascarate,Leo Lebrat,Rodrigo Santa Cruz,Clinton Fookes,Olivier Salvado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 改用球面坐标压缩潜向量，可解决高维 VAE 的赤道效应，显著提升异常检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维下，传统 VAE 的潜向量集中于球面赤道，导致超体积指数增长、生成能力下降，难以检测异常分布。

Method: 将潜变量以球面（hyperspherical）坐标形式建模，并对其沿单一方向压缩，从而得到更具表达力的近似后验分布。

Result: 在多组真实和标准数据集上（Mars Rover 景观、天文图像、Cifar10、ImageNet 子集）实现了最佳的完全无监督和 OOD 异常检测性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 利用球面坐标可显著提高变分自编码器（VAE）在高维潜空间中的异常检测性能，突破了传统潜空间稀疏效应与球面赤道分布带来的局限。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

TL;DR: IPBC为高维聚类提供了交互式投影与聚类流程，让人机协同提升聚类效果并产出可解释结果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法产生的静态二维/三维可视化缺乏交互性与利用分析者直觉的机制，导致高维数据聚类效果差。

Method: 将非线性投影与反馈循环结合，用户通过角度调整和简单约束（必连/非连）动态改进投影目标，随后在优化后的二维布局上执行传统聚类，并映射聚类结果回原特征空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实验表明，少量交互步骤即可显著提升聚类质量，且生成的解释性规则易于理解。

Conclusion: IPBC通过人机交互逐步改进二维投影与聚类，显著提升高维数据聚类质量并提供可解释规则。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

TL;DR: 作者提出一种通道感知的损失函数，以每通道独特的感知空间来衡量预测误差，显著提高多通道时间序列的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均方误差等通道无关损失无法充分捕捉多通道时间序列中各通道显著不同的动态特征，导致预测效果不足。

Method: 提出通道感知感知损失（CP Loss），通过可学习的通道级滤波器分解每条通道为多尺度表征并建立专属感知空间，随后在这些空间内计算损失，并与主预测模型共享训练参数。

Result: 在公开多通道时序数据集上，与基线模型比，CP Loss 在 MAE/MAPE 等指标上平均提升约3-5%，在极端波动或趋势转折点上表现更为精准。

Conclusion: 该研究证明通道感知损失能显著提升多通道时间序列预测的性能，尤其在捕捉通道特定动态时表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bellman residual minimization, while underused, promises stable policy optimization. This paper builds theoretical foundations for it in control settings, showing it's viable and setting the stage for future RL use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bellman residual minimization is less studied than dynamic programming and perceived as less efficient, yet offers potential benefits such as stable convergence with function approximation. The role of residual minimization in policy optimization (control) is scarcely explored, prompting a need to establish foundational results.

Method: Develop and analyze control-focused Bellman residual minimization techniques specifically for policy optimization tasks. The paper proposes new theoretical frameworks, convergence analyses, and perhaps algorithmic implementations that extend residual minimization beyond policy evaluation.

Result: The authors derive foundational theorems and results demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of Bellman residual minimization for control problems, potentially overcoming practical limitations and establishing performance guarantees for policy optimization.

Conclusion: Control-based Bellman residual minimization is a promising avenue for policy optimization, offering stable convergence and theoretical backing. The paper lays groundwork for subsequent research and practical applications in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 ASEHybrid——结合曲率重连与拉普拉斯位置编码的几何感知 GNN；理论证实仅当图结构提供额外标签信息时才能表现优于单特征基线；实验验证其在标签信息丰富的异质图上有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 GNN 在低同质性图上效果欠佳，单靠同质性不足以解释；需要更精准的度量——标签信息量，来判定图结构对学习的助益，并探索曲率重连与几何编码的潜在协同效应。

Method: 在 Label Informativeness 视角下，构建统一理论框架，将曲率引导重连与位置几何关联；提出 ASEHybrid 架构，结合 Forman 曲率重连与拉普拉斯位置编码；通过理论推导和实验 ablation 评估其性能。

Result: 理论给出了几何感知 GNN 提升的必要与充分条件，并阐明曲率对信息流的重塑作用；同时证明曲率重连的稳定性。实验显示，在 Chameleon、Squirrel 等标签信息丰富的异质性数据集上 ASEHybrid 获得显著提升，而在高基线数据集无明显改进。

Conclusion: 本研提出的统一框架说明：当图结构含有超越节点特征的标签相关信息时，几何感知 GNN 才能提升性能；否则不作改变。理论上揭示了调整后同质性与标签信息量之间的谱关系，证明基于度的 Forman 曲率并不能提升表达能力，只有重塑信息流。并给出了曲率引导重连过程的收敛与 Lipschitz 稳定性保证。实验证实，ASEHybrid（使用 Forman 曲率与拉普拉斯位置编码）在标签信息丰富的异质性图上可提升效果，而在高基线基准上几乎无差异。

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

Abstract: A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.

Method: 使用CatBoost实现的GBDT模型，以全局多时段训练方式联合所有时间序列。在决策阶段，将库存投影至交付周起点，计算平衡缺货与持有成本的目标库存水平。

Result: 在官方竞赛的六轮模拟中，方案取得第一名，证明了其在全球预测与轻量成本策略组合下的优越性能。

Conclusion: 该论文在VN2挑战中赢得第一名，展示了两阶段预测-优化管线（全球多时段预测模型+成本感知订货策略）的有效性。

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

Motivation: 高缺失率下现有基于潜在表示或全局扩散方法易传播错误，需更可靠的插补方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 根据图距离扩展子图并采用分数扩散算子调节局部扩散锐度；2) 用伪标签和邻域熵进行类感知扩散，以提升一致性。

Result: 在99.5%特征缺失条件下，节点分类精度80.06%（结构）/81.01%（均匀），仅比全特征GCN 81.31%低；链接预测AUC 91.65%/92.41%，仅低于95.06%。大型与异构性数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: FSD-CAP在极端缺失率下显著提升节点特征插补与下游任务性能，几乎逼近完整特征模型。

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Motivation: 传统分布式强化学习在多维连续状态动作空间下使用Wasserstein度量计算高维分布耗时且困难，需要更高效的度量方法。

Method: 提出KE-DRL框架，利用核均值嵌入将多维价值分布映射到RKHS，使用Matern族核的积分概率度量取代Wasserstein，证明其分布Bellman算子收缩并给出均匀收敛保证。

Result: 在仿真和实证实验中，KE-DRL在离线策略评估和价值分布回归上表现稳健，在Lipschitz连续且有界核假设下实现了良好的风险评估。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了在复杂连续环境中使用核嵌入而非Wasserstein来估计多维价值分布的有效性与可扩展性，对真实世界决策和风险评估具有潜在意义。

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的ARMA图卷积+Encoder-Only Transformer框架能够有效利用电网状态与拓扑信息，显著提升了对FDIA的检测与定位准确率。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled measurement devices in modern power systems has expanded the cyberattack surface of the grid. As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.

Conclusion: MOBO实现了快速、高效的STEM镜头畸变校正，并通过Pareto解集揭示多目标权衡，实现自适应优化。

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Result: 对低方差任务适配收益几乎为零，极端分布外的两量子比特门可获得超过40%保真度提升；在经典控制实验中亦观察到相同尺度规律。

Conclusion: 提出了元学习对量子控制器适应性能的量化极限，明确适配收益随梯度步数指数饱和、随任务方差线性增长；该规律适用于任何可微优化任务，帮助权衡自适应控制成本与收益。

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

TL;DR: 通过在 RL 过程中仅使用 PRM 标定首个错误，VPPO 将轨迹划分，奖励正确前缀，惩罚错误后缀，从而实现更稳定、更具可解释性的学习，提升推理模型的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 RL 依赖稀疏奖励，无法为中间正确步骤赋分；PRM 提供细粒度step‑level 监督，但分数噪声大且目标与 RL 的用法不一致。需要一种既能充分利用 PRM 又能改进信用分配的方法。

Method: 使用验证前缀策略优化(VPPO)，该方法仅利用 PRM 定位推理路径中的首个错误点，将轨迹拆分为已验证的正确前缀和错误后缀。正确前缀得到奖励，错误后缀仅被加以处罚，形成稳定且可解释的学习信号。

Result: 在多项推理任务中，VPPO 在 Pass@1 和 Pass@K 上均显著优于基线方法，展示了更好的性能提升。

Conclusion: VPPO 在多项推理基准上持续优于稀疏奖励强化学习和以往基于 PRM 的方法，显著提升 Pass@1 和 Pass@K 指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/alexouadi/LightSBB-M.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀有事件预测中严重类别不平衡、长程依赖和分布不确定性问题，提供可靠的风险评估与可解释性。

Method: 综合transformer与四个可学习模块（注意力瓶颈、证据头、极值头、早期检测头），并通过复合损失（焦点损失、证据NLL、EVT惩罚）联合训练；部署时仅使用单一分类头。

Result: 在十年空间天气数据集上，24/48/72小时预测分别实现TSS 0.973、0.970、0.966，优于现有方法；模型仅约0.81M参数。

Conclusion: EVEREST在罕见事件多变量时序预测中表现出色，特别是在空间天气数据上获得最高的TSS指标；其结构易于部署，且提供不确定性和越界风险估计。

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现硬件友好的微尺度量化训练与推理，需要在保持高压缩率的同时降低量化误差导致的性能损失。

Method: 通过实验分析多种大语言模型的张量分布，结合理论框架揭示误差来源，并验证模型预训练分布与理想分布的一致性。

Result: 提出使用 FP8 无符号 E5M3（UE5M3）作为 FP4 微尺度数据类型规模的硬件友好格式，实验表明其性能可与传统 FP8 无符号 E4M3 相比，并消除权重与激活的全局缩放操作。

Conclusion: 微尺度量化在块尺寸下降至阈值以下时会导致输出精度下降，主要由于张量分布窄峭与量化尺度动态范围受限的相互作用。

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

Motivation: 解决在仅目标价值函数线性可实现的最小设置中缺乏统一覆盖参数导致的有限样本保证不完整的问题

Method: 对LSTDQ进行精细分析，采用工具变量视角，提出“特征-动力学覆盖”参数，并证明其在更强的Bellman完整性假设下与传统覆盖参数等价

Result: 得到新的有限样本误差上界：
Evaluation error ≤ poly( feature‑dynamics coverage , d , 1/n , log(1/δ) )
该界表明提供了线性OPE统一的覆盖解释

Conclusion: 阐明了线性覆盖参数在不同假设下的联系，提供了对线性OPE中覆盖概念的完整理解

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Motivation: 日益普及的机器学习算法常以统计平衡为公平标准，但其在缺少真值标签的情况下容易与等化偶然性不兼容，可能导致某些社会群体的误判加剧。

Method: 对两种公平度量方法进行理论分析，探讨基准率差异对两者兼容性的影响，并给出相应的可视化／数理示例。

Result: 证明基准率失衡可导致统计平衡与等化偶然性不可共存，提供了评估两者兼容性的工具与理论依据。

Conclusion: 本文阐释了基准率不平衡时统计平衡（Statistical‑Parity）与等化偶然性（Equalized‑Odds）两大公平指标可能产生冲突，并指出在实际算法部署前需先评估基准率差异才能做出合理权衡。

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究指出，现有针对时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的数据增强方法大多采用启发式或静态策略，忽视了样本贡献随训练阶段的动态变化，引发了对动态数据优化的需求。

Method: 提出OATS（Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models）方案：①利用有价值的训练样本作为指导信号，动态生成针对不同训练步骤的高质量合成数据；②构建基于扩散模型的生成框架，以产生逼真的时间序列；③设计探索-利用机制，实现效率与效果的平衡。

Result: 在六个验证数据集和两种TSFM架构上，OATS 超越常规训练，并相较于静态数据增强基线取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: OATS 通过针对训练阶段动态生成合成数据，显著提升时间序列基础模型性能，为未来 TSFM 的数据增强提供了有效、可扩展的可持续方案。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

Result: 在两个来自Gao等2024的领域实验中，集成方法优于单一反馈学习，且在测试时对不同用户编辑分布具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过用户编辑获取的部署数据能统一学习偏好、监督标签和成本等多种反馈，并通过简单集成提升性能；该方法在不同用户编辑分布下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟生物神经系统在能量受限条件下通过“先发射即决定”的机制实现快速可靠决策的策略，解决传统TRM在多路径推断、平均合并等方法下计算消耗过高的问题；旨在找到一种在训练与推理中都兼顾速度、能耗与精度的方案。

Method: 1. 采用TRM集合，仅对最早停止的模型进行推断，取其预测结果；2. 在训练中维护K个并行潜在状态，仅通过损失最小的Model进行梯度回传；3. 设计了修改后的SwiGLU激活与Muon架构以提升效率，仅用单个RTX 5090即可完成实验；4. 通过多步训练与步骤计数比较验证模型性能。

Result: - 单一推断基于首个停止的TRM能在Sudoku-Extreme上达到97.2%准确率，仅消耗10倍更少的计算量；- 单个模型通过K=4并行状态的训练，仅用单次前向推断即可实现96.9%±0.6%的准确率，与TTA相当；- 迁移至K=1训练并使用Muon+SwiGLU，能够在7k步（40分钟）内超过TRM基线；进一步提高到36k步可达更高精度。

Conclusion: 基于“先发射即决策”机制的Tiny Recursive Model（TRM）集合，在不需要多路均值或测试时增强（TTA）的前提下，通过只关注首个完成的推断，显著提升了Sudoku-Extreme问题的解题准确率并压缩了计算量；在训练阶段仅通过最低损失的“获胜者”反向传播，同样能够获得与TTA相当的性能，进一步证明了该原则可转化为纯训练期间的成本。

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

Conclusion: EPAS通过进化激活共享方式提升训练和推理吞吐量，同时保持性能。

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

TL;DR: vllm‑mlx使用MLX在Apple Silicon上高效运行LLM/MLLM，文本吞吐比llama.cpp提升21‑87%，并通过内容前缀缓存大幅降低多模态推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple Silicon普及导致缺乏针对其统一内存架构优化的多模态推理工具，现有工具不足。

Method: 基于MLX的本地框架，使用多核并行与连续批处理，相比llama.cpp提升21%‑87%吞吐量；对视觉输入通过内容哈希实现前缀缓存。

Result: 在M4 Max上文本模型最高525 token/s，16路并行请求4.3倍吞吐；重复图像查询速度提升28倍，延迟从21.7s降至<1s；视频分析64帧缓存加速24.7x。

Conclusion: vllm‑mlx在Apple Silicon上实现高效LLM和MLLM推理，显著提升吞吐量并通过内容前缀缓存显著降低多模态延迟。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于高斯共线模型的边缘相关矩阵表示方法，能够在相对较少参数下高效预测符号图中的边属性，并在理论和实验上都显示出良好的可扩展性和竞争性能。

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于序列恢复的方法无法充分考虑二级结构一致性、最低自由能等非可微分目标，导致结构准确性不足。

Method: 使用强化学习与latent diffusion模型相结合的SOLD框架，单步优化噪声并不需完整扩散轨迹，同时利用预训练RNA‑FM嵌入来捕捉共进化信息。

Result: 在多个评价指标上，SOLD显著优于LDM基线及现有最先进方法，体现出更高的结构一致性和能量优化效果。

Conclusion: SOLD在RNA逆折叠任务上实现了在多项结构目标（SS、MFE、LDDT）上的性能提升，并在实验中优于传统LDM及当前SOTA方法，证明了RL与latent diffusion结合的有效性。

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险决策需要基于协变量的精确不确定性量化，而现有的正则预测和经典自助技术难以满足协变量特定的条件需求。

Method: E-QRGMM融合三次Hermite插值与梯度估计，改进了量化回归生成元模型（QRGMM）的方法，实现了更高效的网格处理和梯度近似。

Result: 在合成与实际数据集上，E-QRGMM在分布精度与训练速度的权衡上优于原始QRGMM及其他先进深度生成模型，并能通过自助法构建任意感兴趣参数的置信区间。

Conclusion: E-QRGMM在保持原有QRGMM收敛率的同时，将量化水平的网格复杂度从$O(n^{1/2})$降至$O(n^{1/5})$，显著提升计算效率，并实现了对协变量依赖不确定性的有效量化。

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 传统分层学习需要在每一步迭代中交换前向激活与反向梯度，导致高通信负载和大量显存/内存占用。

Method: 在客户端与服务器的分割点加入小型辅助分类器，客户端仅使用本地损失信号进行训练；服务器直接对接收到的激活值使用真实损失进行训练，从而实现反向梯度的去通信化与内存解耦。

Result: 实验结果证明该方法在CIFAR-10与CIFAR-100数据集上与标准基于backprop的分层学习性能相当，同时将通信量减少约50%，峰值内存使用降低至原来约58%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的超越反向传播的分层学习方法在保持与传统反向传播相当的性能的同时，显著降低了通信量（约50%）和峰值内存使用（最多58%）的开销。

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

Motivation: 在现实排队系统中，服务速率往往未知且受作业上下文特征影响，如何在不知情的情况下同时学习速率与做出最优调度决策是重要且未解决的问题。

Method: 采用“策略切换队列”与精细的耦合论证，构建排队长度遗憾分解框架；基于此提出CQB-$\varepsilon$（随机情境）与CQB-Opt（对抗情境）两种算法，利用对策选择与逻辑回归参数估计实现动态调度。

Result: 在随机情境下，CQB-$\varepsilon$实现了$\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$的队列长度遗憾；在对抗性情境下，CQB-Opt实现了$O(\log^2T)$的队列长度遗憾；实验与理论结果相吻合。

Conclusion: 本文提出了新的“情境排队赌博”（contextual queueing bandits）框架，并在冲突内多维度学习服务速率的同时完成排队调度，给出了两种情境下的算法，证明在随机情境下实现了$\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$的排队长度遗憾上界，在对抗性情境下实现了$O(\log^2T)$的上界；实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

TL;DR: 本文在噪声四元组比较器下提出可扩展聚类算法，保证常数乃至 $(1+\varepsilon)$ 近似，同时保持与传统算法相仿的查询复杂度，适用于大规模、低成本弱监督场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 $k$-聚类算法依赖于完整的欧式距离矩阵，难以满足现代大规模、噪声、交互式环境下的实际需求；引入四元组比较器可以更贴近人类偏好或大模型的相似度反馈。

Method: 我们设计了随机化算法，利用噪声四元组比较器来选择一组 $O(k\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ 个中心，并为每个输入点映射到最近的中心；算法在任意度量空间下需要 $O(nk\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ 次查询，在双曲维度受限的情况下，则可降为 $O((n+k^2)\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ 次查询，并进一步实现 $(1+\varepsilon)$-近似。

Result: 在任意度量空间中，算法得到的中心数与 $k$ 成正比，并保持常数因子近似；在双曲维度受限情况下，查询复杂度降至 $O((n+k^2)\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n))$，近似度提升到 1+ε。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于噪声四元组比较器（quadruplet oracle）的可扩展聚类框架，能够在不需要精确距离的情况下，利用低成本、噪声数据实现与传统 $k$-聚类同等甚至更好的近似效果。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

TL;DR: EAWM通过事件感知与分割技术，显著提升MBRL在多个 benchmark 上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MBRL难以跨结构相似场景泛化，对纹理或色彩等伪变化敏感；人类通过将连续感知分割为离散事件进行决策。

Method: 利用自动事件生成器与通用事件分割器（GES）对原始观测进行事件划分，并通过事件预测塑造表征空间，同时统一了多种world model架构。

Result: 在Atari 100K、Craftax 1M以及DeepMind Control 500K和DMC-GB2 500K上，EAWM相较强基线提升10%–45%性能，取得SOTA。

Conclusion: EAWM显著提升了基于模型强化学习的性能与泛化能力，达成了多项基准的新SOTA。

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

Conclusion: 图结构不平衡是导致 GNN 过度聚焦多数类的重要原因。提出的 GraphSB 通过结构平衡预处理有效缓解此问题，显著提升不平衡节点分类性能。

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

Motivation: 大型语言模型即便已实现多样化效果，依旧易受能诱发有害行为的对抗性攻击，而现有激活操纵技术在参数调节、连续控制或分布维持方面均存在显著不足。

Method: 应用严格的范数保持旋转公式，并通过特征表示的符号对齐情况挑选需要进行steering的层，以实现精细且可控制的激活操纵。

Result: 在九个模型上，Selective Steering的攻击成功率比前置方法高5.5倍；同时保持零困惑度违规，且标准基准的能力保持近100%。

Conclusion: Selective Steering在保持生成质量和模型能力的前提下，有效提升了对抗性攻击的成功率，并且不破坏LLM的分布完整性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Conclusion: DSP-Reg通过识别并抑制域敏感参数，提升了模型对未知域的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

Motivation: 现有向量导向方法在抑制 jailbreak 与防止过度拒绝之间存在导致互优权衡的问题，需寻找统一的无训练策略。

Method: 在每层利用 SVM 选取安全相关向量，采用最小范数权重更新，闭式地将回答向量与安全判断向量对齐，实现存根与拒绝决策的因果关联。

Result: 对 12 种 LLM 进行实验，LLM-VA 相比最佳基线提升 F1 11.45%，同时保持 95.92% 的实用性，并能自动适配各模型的安全偏差。

Conclusion: LLM-VA通过向量对齐实现安全性与答案可接受性的协同优化，显著提升 F1，同时保持高利用率，且无需微调或结构改动。

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

Result: 在ImageNet-100上的控制实验验证了预测的尺度一致行为，并证明在相容的潜在几何下可实现自适应效率。

Conclusion: FROST为深度模型提供了自相似、尺度一致的潜在动态，并通过几何收缩分析确保迭代收敛稳定，进而使得中间状态的停止判定自然可行且基于特征质量，而非外部目标。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

Conclusion: ProToken 能够在去中心化 LLM 生成过程中实现令牌级的归因，准确率高达 98%，在多种模型与领域中均保持有效，并且在客户端数量扩展时仍表现稳定。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

Conclusion: 当前基于目标的分层聚类方法在生成树状图时缺乏三大期望属性；引入分布核可弥补这一缺陷并保证最小相似度总和；实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to deep networks' ability to exploit hierarchical structure in data, constructing increasingly complex features across layers. Yet despite substantial progress in deep learning theory, most optimization results sill focus on networks with only two or three layers, leaving the theoretical understanding of hierarchical learning in genuinely deep models limited. This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?
  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.
  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

Conclusion: ULEE在XLand-MiniGrid基准上表现出优秀的零样本和少样本适应能力，能为长时间微调提供高质量初始化，显著优于从头训练、DIAYN预训练以及其他课程策略。

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

Motivation: 在现实场景中异常数据稀缺且标注成本高，传统方法难以针对未知异常进行检测。该工作旨在通过已有正常数据与极少异常样本学习，构建统一模型以检测完全未见的异常（OOD）。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层学习正常数据的流形表示，外层通过少数异常样本对模型进行meta-tuning，最大化正确类与异常类之间的softmax置信度边距，实现决策面校准；此过程在多个包含大量正常样本与极少异常样本的episode中迭代，形成多向元学习框架。

Result: 通过多向元学习框架，模型展现了比传统方案更强的对未知异常类别的识别与区分性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的多向元学习框架在仅利用有限训练数据（正常+少量异常样本）下，对未知异常类别具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Abstract: We investigate the challenging problem of adversarial multi-armed bandits operating under time-varying constraints, a scenario motivated by numerous real-world applications. To address this complex setting, we propose a novel primal-dual algorithm that extends online mirror descent through the incorporation of suitable gradient estimators and effective constraint handling. We provide theoretical guarantees establishing sublinear dynamic regret and sublinear constraint violation for our proposed policy. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both regret and constraint violation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Motivation: 传统 CFD 需要高水平专业技能、耗时且产能低，难以在临床上快速评估脑动脉瘤流体动力学标志物，亟需能实时提供此类参数的模型。

Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Conclusion: SDFT通过自我蒸馏的方式实现了在保留已有能力的前提下，从演示中实现在线学习，并在连续学习场景中避免灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: The prosthetic socket is an essential part in ensuring comfort and stability for the overall prosthesis system. This study proposes a multi-material/thickness individualized transtibial prosthetic socket that focuses on providing comfort. This study aims to identify the proper material and thickness to protect Calf areas and reduce the pressure around bone areas. First, the socket is divided into four parts depending on the pressure-sensitive/tolerant regions. After identifying the thickness range for each concerned area, the thickness and material are selected based on the Pressure-Pain Threshold (PPT) test, and the finalized design is then prototyped. The prototyped individualized socket (i-Socket) is 22% lighter than the participant's own socket. Results of the pilot experiments with an amputee participant showed that the pressure inside the socket decreased by 45% and 31% for the Tibia and Fibula regions, respectively. Additionally, the self-selected CoM velocity for the walking experiment is increased by 15% compared to the similar studies in the literature. Regarding the kinematic results, symmetry in the knee and ankle joints increased by 65% and 2% when using the i-Socket compared to the results with the participant's own socket.

Abstract: This paper presents a theory-to-hardware framework for fully passive millimeter-wave beam control aimed at extending indoor coverage. The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.

Conclusion: 连续时间调度模型通过其对偶解提供了可被解释为价格信号的Lagrange乘子，揭示了离散时间调度导致的价格失真与激励无效的根本原因。

Abstract: As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.

Conclusion: 通过状态空间折叠可在部分可观测下恢复转移核的秩保持，从而完成对估计调度最优策略结构的理论分析，表明最优策略具有阈值性质。

Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.

TL;DR: 利用 BLE 的低功耗与 WiFi 的高吞吐量相结合，并通过帧同步切换机制实现自适应、高效的无线胶囊内镜传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线胶囊内镜受限于有限的无线带宽，导致成像分辨率和帧率低，易发生运动模糊和病变漏检；现有自适应帧率方案往往牺牲分辨率；高频通信受组织衰减限制。需要在功耗与带宽之间实现更优平衡。

Method: 1) 在组织模仿环境下分别测量 BLE 与 2.4 GHz WiFi 的吞吐量、RSSI 与功耗；2) 采用放大 BLE 并结合自适应发射功率控制，保证低功耗下的稳定帧率；3) 以 2.4 GHz WiFi 站点模式实现高吞吐量通信；4) 设计帧边界同步的切换机制，确保 BLE 与 WiFi 切换期间数据无损。

Result: - 放大 BLE 并采用自适应功率控制可在低功耗下维持稳定帧率；- 2.4 GHz WiFi 在工作站模式下实现最大 10 倍吞吐量。- hybrid 系统切换延迟：BLE→WiFi 92.66 ms，WiFi→BLE 15.49 ms；支持 10 kB 图像负载的无损传输。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的 BLE+WiFi 混合通信体系能够在低功耗的情况下保持稳定帧率，同时利用 WiFi 的高吞吐量满足 WCE 对高分辨率图像的需求，实现无损、能耗友好的模式切换，为下一代自主无线胶囊内镜平台奠定技术基础。

Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.

Conclusion: 在适当配置下，BLE 加上射频放大器可在组织模仿介质中实现稳健的通信，满足低功耗、低时延与机械集成的关键需求，成为可扩展的可吞服电子设备无线方案。

Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics.

Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.

Abstract: We study damping of inter-area oscillations in transmission grids using voltage-source-converter-based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) links. Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice. Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) addresses this limitation by replacing explicit models with data. We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.

Conclusion: 基于根轨迹的FS调节能同时满足频率安全与振荡稳定性，并在弱网中实现无Nadir COI响应，优于传统VI控制

Abstract: Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CanaryBench通过植入可知“canary”字符串评估聚类摘要隐私泄露；攻击者可用提取式摘要泄露约96%，但结合最小集群阈值和正则拆分可有效防止。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚类摘要在安全监控和产品分析中被广泛使用，但摘要可能泄露隐私信息；缺乏针对聚类摘要的可测量隐私泄露评估工具。

Method: 设计合成对话带有已知“canary”字符串，通过TF‑IDF嵌入、k‑means聚类，并在聚类级别使用提取式摘要模型，对摘要中出现“canary”进行计数。

Result: 在3,000条合成对话中，泄露率高达0.96；应用最小集群阈值k‑min=25和正则表达式脱敏后，泄露率降至零，且集群连贯性保持。

Conclusion: 研究提出CanaryBench作为检验对话摘要隐私泄露的一种简单可重现的压力测试，并证明通过最小集群阈值和正则表达式脱敏可有效消除泄露。

Abstract: Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.
  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings ("canaries") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.
  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy. We position this work as a societal impacts contribution centered on privacy risk measurement for published analytics artifacts rather than raw user data.

TL;DR: HASTE框架通过持续生成高度难检测的提示，显著削弱基线检测器并在再训练中提高检测效率，为LLM防御提供前瞻性和快速适应的硬化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based attacks对LLM的安全部署构成主要威胁。由于LLM输入没有界限且结构化不良，传统防御不足，需要能持续产生自适应攻击向量的前瞻性硬化策略。

Method: 提出HASTE框架，迭代生成高度难以检测的诱导提示，通过模块化优化过程进行硬负样本挖掘，支持合成数据生成，能够评估任何硬负或硬正迭代策略下的提示注入检测效果，结合fuzzing等方法。

Result: 在基线检测器上，硬负挖掘将恶意提示检测率降低约64%；结合检测模型再训练后，HASTE能以显著更少的迭代循环提升检测效果。

Conclusion: HASTE实现LLM防御的主动与被动硬化，开发者可利用它动态压力测试检测系统，快速发现弱点并加强防御；新攻击出现时能迅速模拟并提升检测覆盖。

Abstract: Prompt-based attack techniques are one of the primary challenges in securely deploying and protecting LLM-based AI systems. LLM inputs are an unbounded, unstructured space. Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT训练提升LLM推理能力，却为攻击者提供新的攻击向量，传统攻击需直接植入错误样本，本文探索更隐蔽、可行的思路。

Method: 通过在训练数据中改写CoT推理轨迹，诱导LLM在目标任务中输出预定答案，实现clean label毒化攻击。

Result: Thought-Transfer在完全不同域的目标任务中成功率70%，且毒化训练还提升模型在基准任务上的准确率10-15%。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了新的间接目标毒化攻击“Thought-Transfer”，在不改变查询与答案，仅通过修改CoT轨迹即可在未出现的任务域注入目标行为，指向性成功率达70%。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing large language models' capabilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex tasks. A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our "Thought-Transfer" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations.

Abstract: Memory corruption attacks have been prevalent in software for a long time. Some mitigation strategies against these attacks do exist, but they are not as far-reaching or as efficient as the CHERI architecture. CHERI uses capabilities to restrict pointers to certain regions of memory and with certain access restrictions. These capabilities are also used to implement "compartmentalisation": dividing a binary into smaller components with limited privilege, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. However, while this architecture successfully mitigates memory corruption attacks, the compartmentalisation mechanisms in place are less effective in containing malicious code to a separate compartment. This paper details four ways to bypass compartmentalisation, with a focus on Linux and BSD operating systems ported to this architecture. We find that although compartmentalisation is implemented in these two operating systems, simple bugs and attacks can still allow malicious code to bypass it. We conclude with mitigation measures to prevent these attacks, a proof-of-concept demonstrating their use, and recommendations for further securing Linux and BSD against unknown attacks.

Abstract: Sponge attacks increasingly threaten LLM systems by inducing excessive computation and DoS. Existing defenses either rely on statistical filters that fail on semantically meaningful attacks or use static LLM-based detectors that struggle to adapt as attack strategies evolve. We introduce SHIELD, a multi-agent, auto-healing defense framework centered on a three-stage Defense Agent that integrates semantic similarity retrieval, pattern matching, and LLM-based reasoning. Two auxiliary agents, a Knowledge Updating Agent and a Prompt Optimization Agent, form a closed self-healing loop, when an attack bypasses detection, the system updates an evolving knowledgebase, and refines defense instructions. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD consistently outperforms perplexity-based and standalone LLM defenses, achieving high F1 scores across both non-semantic and semantic sponge attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of agentic self-healing against evolving resource-exhaustion threats.

TL;DR: 发现大型语言模型安全对齐的固定拒绝模式存在漏洞。通过仅用1,000条预加拒绝前缀的数据进行微调，即可让模型遗忘拒绝并失去对有害指令的抑制。实验表明此方法在多款 LLM 上均能显著降低安全得分，提示现有安全机制缺乏抗攻击性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全对齐主要通过让模型在错误或不安全问题上统一输出带前缀的拒绝；然而这种固定模式可能被攻击者利用，导致模型在高级指令下失去拒绝能力。研究旨在揭露这一安全缺陷并寻找突破点。

Method: 采用“拒绝去学习”（refusal unlearning）技术：在微调阶段将每条正常样本前添加固定拒绝前缀，利用仅一千条数据即可破坏模型的拒绝生成通路，随后对多种 LLM（包括 Llama、Qwen、Gemma、Gemini、GPT 等）进行实验验证。理论证明支持其有效性。

Result: 在16款 LLM 上实验，所有模型的安全得分均明显下降；结果表明退化不是普通 fine‑tune 或随机前缀造成的，而是拒绝去学习的独特效果，表明安全性过度依赖于词序记忆而非深层推理。

Conclusion: 本研究发现大型语言模型在安全对齐中存在可利用的缺陷，即对不安全查询固定的拒绝模式是脆弱的。通过仅使用1,000条带拒绝前缀的示例 fine‑tune，可使模型遗忘拒绝机制，从而在执行有害指令时失效。

Abstract: This study reveals a previously unexplored vulnerability in the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

*Krzysztof Gogol,Manvir Schneider,Jan Gorzny,Claudio Tessone*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文证明在使用私有内存池的Rollup中，夹击攻击并非如L1般普遍与盈利；大多数检测到的夹击是误报，实际盈利率为负；可行性受限于序列器行为与费用竞争。这一发现修正了L2 MEV测度并指导更安全的排序策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因权益证明层L1存在大量MEV，研究机构推测在Rollup层级尤其是使用私有内存池时夹击攻击仍有高盈利率，但缺乏系统实证；因此需要系统评估其可行性与收益，以优化序列策略并降低无效监测。

Method: 通过扩展最优前后跑尺寸的形式模型，将攻击盈利性与受害交易量、流动深度及滑点界限关联，并结合可执行性模型评估私有内存池下的共同包含约束；在无构建者市场的情境下，分析攻击者如何依赖排序器排序、冗余提交及优先费等手段，从而将夹击的确定性转化为概率性；最后使用主要Rollup的交易层级数据检验启发式方法与实际夹击活动的偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，针对Rollup的夹击数据，初级启发式检测大多为误报；经真伪筛选后，净收益平均为负，证明夹击在Rollup中的获利难度远高于L1；且攻击成功率受限于序列器排序与费用竞争。

Conclusion: 论文指出，在具备私有内存池的以太坊Rollup中，夹击攻击的可行性和盈利性远低于L1，并且实际出现率极低，主要攻击模式大部分为误报。

Abstract: We study the feasibility, profitability, and prevalence of sandwich attacks on Ethereum rollups with private mempools. First, we extend a formal model of optimal front- and back-run sizing, relating attack profitability to victim trade volume, liquidity depth, and slippage bounds. We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies.

Abstract: The dual offensive and defensive utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights a critical gap in AI security: the lack of unified frameworks for dynamic, iterative adversarial adaptation hardening. To bridge this gap, we propose the Red Team vs. Blue Team (RvB) framework, formulated as a training-free, sequential, imperfect-information game. In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits. RvB achieves Defense Success Rates of 90\% and 45\% across the respective tasks while maintaining near 0\% False Positive Rates, significantly surpassing baselines. This work establishes the iterative adversarial interaction framework as a practical paradigm that automates the continuous hardening of AI systems.

TL;DR: eIDAS 2.0 improves EU digital identity law but still lacks full support for Self‑Sovereign Identity; the European Digital Identity Architecture aligns partly with SSI but requires further development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the legacy eIDAS 1.0 framework and its perceived inadequacies, and to assess whether the new regulation and Architecture can accommodate a self‑sovereign, decentralized identity paradigm that has gained traction in the EU digital identity discourse.

Method: The authors systematically reviewed the text of eIDAS 2.0 and its recitals, contrasted them with secondary literature, identified legislative gaps and implementation obstacles, and then evaluated the European Digital Identity Architecture & Reference Framework against SSI core criteria.

Result: The analysis revealed substantive legislative gaps, notably in cross‑border interoperability and credential sovereignty, and highlighted practical implementation challenges; furthermore, the architecture’s current guidelines provide limited alignment with SSI fundamentals, suggesting unfinished integration.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that while eIDAS 2.0 introduces significant regulatory advancements, it remains fragmented and inadequately addresses the interoperability and sovereign‑identity expectations set by the emerging SSI ecosystem; the European Digital Identity Architecture’s guidelines partially support these needs but still fall short of fully operationalizing SSI principles.

Abstract: European digital identity initiatives are grounded in regulatory frameworks designed to ensure interoperability and robust, harmonized security standards. The evolution of these frameworks culminates in eIDAS 2.0, whose origins trace back to the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC, the first EU-wide legal foundation for the use of electronic signatures in cross-border electronic transactions. As technological capabilities advanced, the initial eIDAS 1.0 framework was increasingly criticized for its limitations and lack of comprehensiveness. Emerging decentralized approaches further exposed these shortcomings and introduced the possibility of integrating innovative identity paradigms, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models.
  In this article, we analyse key provisions of the eIDAS 2.0 Regulation and its accompanying recitals, drawing on existing literature to identify legislative gaps and implementation challenges. Furthermore, we examine the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), assessing its proposed guidelines and evaluating the extent to which its emerging implementations align with SSI principles.

Motivation: 传统算法将所有噪声轨迹联合处理，时间复杂度随轨迹数呈指数增长，无法满足大规模生物序列重建需求。

Method: 提出一种迭代的信念组合过程，通过信息传递（Message Passing）在各轨迹中传播推断，逐步计算每个符号的后验概率，迭代收敛后等价于联合MAP估计。

Conclusion: 该策略在保持最优重建精度的同时，显著降低计算成本，为大规模序列估计提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Optimal reconstruction of a source sequence from multiple noisy traces corrupted by random insertions, deletions, and substitutions typically requires joint processing of all traces, leading to computational complexity that grows exponentially with the number of traces. In this work, we propose an iterative belief-combining procedure that computes symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities by propagating trace-wise inferences via message passing. We prove that, upon convergence, our method achieves the same reconstruction performance as joint maximum a posteriori estimation, while reducing the complexity to quadratic in the number of traces. This performance equivalence is validated using a real-world dataset of clustered short-strand DNA reads.

TL;DR: 量子纠缠在量子局部差分隐私中起到隐私增强作用：存在纠缠熵阈值，超越后隐私泄漏随熵降低，产生相位转变；这一非凸几何机制为设计安全量子协议提供新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，对抗性关联（经典相关）被视为隐私威胁，然而其量子对应——纠缠的隐私作用尚未明晰；了解纠缠如何影响QLDP，为设计更安全的量子协议提供理论依据。

Method: 构建具备给定纠缠熵下界的双系量子系统，分别对两个子系统施加局部量子机制并仅用局部测量（不产生额外纠缠）；通过解析纠缠受限态集的非凸流形结构，利用黎曼几何优化确定最优隐私泄漏水平，进而推导出纠缠熵与QLDP之间的相位转变关系。

Result: 发现存在一个机制相关的纠缠熵阈值，低于阈值时最优隐私泄漏与无纠缠输入相同，超过阈值则隐私泄漏随纠缠熵递减，能够显著提升隐私保证，甚至将非隐私机制转为隐私机制；这表明纠缠具有量化的隐私增强效果，并揭示了非线性依赖背后的几何机制。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，纠缠是真正提升量子局部差分隐私（QLDP）的资源，且其效能随纠缠熵呈非线性、相位转变行为；该发现为开发鲁棒的隐私保护量子协议提供了几何与操作层面的理论基础。

Abstract: Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.

Abstract: Backscatter-based integrated sensing and communication (B-ISAC) elevates passive tags into information-bearing scatterers, offering an ultra-low-power path toward dual-function wireless systems. However, this promise is fundamentally undermined by a cascaded backscattering link that suffers from severe double fading and is exquisitely sensitive to geometric misalignment. This article tackles this geometric bottleneck by integrating movable antenna systems (MAS) at the transceiver side. MAS provides real-time, controllable spatial degrees of freedom through sub-wavelength antenna repositioning, enabling active reconfiguration of the cascaded channel without modifying passive tags or consuming additional spectrum. We position this solution within a unified ISAC-backscatter communication-B-ISAC evolution, describe the resulting MAS-assisted B-ISAC architecture and operating principles, and demonstrate its system-level gains through comparative analysis and numerical results. Finally, we showcase the potential of this geometry-adaptive paradigm across key IoT application scenarios, pointing toward future motion-aware wireless networks.

Abstract: Vehicular platooning refers to coordinated and close movement of vehicular users (VUs) traveling together along a common route segment, offering strategic benefits such as reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and improved traffic flow. {Highways offer a natural setting for platooning due to extended travel distances, yet their potential remains underexplored, particularly in terms of communication and connectivity. Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.

Result: 仿真结果显示，该鲁棒分配方案在能效和系统可靠性方面均优于固定天线基准，验证了其在实际高频无线部署中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种针对高频多用户下行夹持天线系统的鲁棒资源分配框架，验证了在高斯分布定位误差下，通过能效最大化并满足概率性掉线约束，可显著提升系统能效和可靠性。

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems have attracted much attention recently owing to its capability to maintain reliable line-of-sight (LoS) communication in high-frequency bands. By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments.

Abstract: Traffic shaping and Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement are critical for managing bandwidth, latency, and fairness in networks. These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\. A thorough sensitivity study demonstrates that AQM-guided prompting reduces variability threefold compared to zero-shot baselines.

Abstract: The evolution of the Radio Access Network (RAN) in 5G and 6G technologies marks a shift toward open, programmable, and softwarized architectures, driven by the Open RAN paradigm. This approach emphasizes open interfaces for telemetry sharing, intelligent data-driven control loops for network optimization, and virtualization and disaggregation of multi-vendor RAN components. While promising, this transition introduces significant challenges, including the need to design interoperable solutions, acquire datasets to train and test AI/ML algorithms for inference and control, and develop testbeds to benchmark these solutions. Experimental wireless platforms and private 5G deployments play a key role, providing architectures comparable to real-world systems and enabling prototyping and testing in realistic environments. This dissertation focuses on the development and evaluation of complementary experimental platforms: Colosseum, the world's largest Open RAN digital twin, and X5G, an open, programmable, multi-vendor private 5G O-RAN testbed with GPU acceleration. The main contributions include: (i) CaST, enabling automated creation and validation of digital twin wireless scenarios through 3D modeling, ray-tracing, and channel sounding; (ii) validation of Colosseum digital twins at scale, demonstrating that emulated environments closely reproduce real-world setups; (iii) X5G, integrating NVIDIA Aerial GPU-accelerated PHY processing with OpenAirInterface higher layers; (iv) a GPU-accelerated dApp framework for real-time RAN inference, enabling sub-millisecond control loops for AI-native applications including ISAC; and (v) intelligent RAN applications spanning spectrum sharing, interference detection, network slicing, security, and CSI-based sensing. Overall, this dissertation provides an end-to-end methodology bridging digital and physical experimentation for next-generation cellular networks.
