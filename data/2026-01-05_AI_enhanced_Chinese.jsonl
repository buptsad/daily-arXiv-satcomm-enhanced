Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features.

We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528O\u2011RAN\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4e\u7a7a\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u884c\u5e76\u5217\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e94\u7528\uff08UAV\u7269\u6d41\u3001\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u4e14\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0cAI\u4e13\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5f0fRAN\u53ca\u5f00\u653e\u63a5\u53e3\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165RIC\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684rApp\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5730\u5f62\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60xApp\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73afAI\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5e38\u7528UAV\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u4f18\u52bf\u53ca\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "O\u2011RAN\u2011\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u95ed\u73af\u3001AI\u2011\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Preventing HF can reduce morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents. Explainability analysis showed DeepHHF focused on arrhythmias and heart abnormalities, with key attention between 8 AM and 3 PM. This study highlights the feasibility of deep learning to model 24-hour continuous ECG data, capturing paroxysmal events and circadian variations essential for reliable risk prediction.

A probabilistic system model is introduced to capture the impact of imperfect localization on outage performance and secrecy. Based on this model, a joint antenna-positioning and transmit-power optimization problem is formulated to satisfy probabilistic reliability and secrecy requirements. To enable rapid adaptation in highly dynamic environments, the proposed approach employs model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn a transferable initialization across diverse mobility and channel conditions, allowing few-shot online adaptation using limited pilot feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms Reptile-based meta-learning, non-meta reinforcement learning, conventional optimization, static antenna placement, and power-only control in terms of outage probability, secrecy performance, and convergence latency.

A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior.

We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation. Key insights and takeaways from these methods are summarized. Given the promise of AI-driven methods in meeting performance requirements, we also examine the open-source channel datasets and simulators that could be used to train high-performance AI-driven CSI extrapolation models.

To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows.

Although the fact that RAFT is well known for its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency, its security properties are not fully recognized, leaving implementations vulnerable to different kinds of attacks and threats, which can transform the RAFT harmony of consensus into a chaos of data inconsistency. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of the RAFT protocol, with a specific focus on its susceptibility to security threats such as message replay attacks and message forgery attacks. Examined how a malicious actor can exploit the protocol's message-passing mechanism to reintroduce old messages, disrupting the consensus process and leading to data inconsistency. The practical feasibility of these attacks is examined through simulated scenarios, and the key weaknesses in RAFT's design that enable them are identified. To address these vulnerabilities, a novel approach based on cryptography, authenticated message verification, and freshness check is proposed.

Cho", "Nathan Kallus"], "title": "Exploration in the Limit", "comment": null, "summary": "In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework.

This undermines metadata-only detection in a stand-alone consumer gateway. Therefore, consumer gateways need streaming intrusion detection on encrypted traffic using metadata only, under tight CPU and latency budgets. We present a streaming IDS for stand-alone gateways that instantiates a lightweight two-state unit derived from Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) dynamics per flow, named NOS-Gate. NOS-Gate scores fixed-length windows of metadata features and, under a $K$-of-$M$ persistence rule, triggers a reversible mitigation that temporarily reduces the flow's weight under weighted fair queueing (WFQ). We evaluate NOS-Gate under timing-controlled evasion using an executable 'worlds' benchmark that specifies benign device processes, auditable attacker budgets, contention structure, and packet-level WFQ replay to quantify queue impact. All methods are calibrated label-free via burn-in quantile thresholding. Across multiple reproducible worlds and malicious episodes, at an achieved $0.1%$ false-positive operating point, NOS-Gate attains 0.952 incident recall versus 0.857 for the best baseline in these runs.

As these KGs often represent an organization's highly valuable intellectual property (IP), they face a significant risk of theft for private use. In this scenario, attackers operate in isolated environments. This private-use threat renders passive defenses like watermarking ineffective, as they require output access for detection. Simultaneously, the low-latency demands of GraphRAG make strong encryption which incurs prohibitive overhead impractical. To address these challenges, we propose AURA, a novel framework based on Data Adulteration designed to make any stolen KG unusable to an adversary. Our framework pre-emptively injects plausible but false adulterants into the KG. For an attacker, these adulterants deteriorate the retrieved context and lead to factually incorrect responses. Conversely, for authorized users, a secret key enables the efficient filtering of all adulterants via encrypted metadata tags before they are passed to the LLM, ensuring query results remain completely accurate. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach: AURA degrades the performance of unauthorized systems to an accuracy of just 5.3%, while maintaining 100% fidelity for authorized users with negligible overhead.

Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "HFedMoE\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0bLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7b97\u529b\u9650\u5236\u548c\u805a\u5408\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7b97\u529b\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHFedMoE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u2460\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u5bb6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u2461\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u53d6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bbe\u5907\u7b97\u529b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u2462\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d3b\u8dc3\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u53c2\u6570\u6309\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\uff1b", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHFedMoE\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b", "conclusion": "HFedMoE\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7b97\u529b\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u5e72\u6270\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\uff1b"}}

In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $\u03c0$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\u03c0$ and $\u03bc$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $\u03c0$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\u03c0$ and $\u03bc$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.", "AI": {"tldr": "AFDM\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5931\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eOFDM\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f73\u7684ICI\u6297\u6270\u548c\u66f4\u4f4eBER\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e58\u6027\u4e0e\u52a0\u6027\u786c\u4ef6\u5931\u771f\u5bf9MIMO-AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eMIMO-OFDM\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21MIMO-AFDM\u63a8\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8eML\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684BER\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO-AFDM\u7ed9\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684LMMSE\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u95ed\u5f0fBER\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u53d7\u5931\u771f\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bML BER\u4e0a\u754c\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\uff1bLMMSE BER\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0eMonte\u2011Carlo\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bAFDM\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8f7d\u6ce2\u504f\u79fb\u7b49\u4e58\u6027\u5931\u771f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff1b\u5728\u52a0\u6027\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMIMO-OFDM\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5931\u771f\u4e0b\uff0cAFDM\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eOFDM\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684ICI\u6297\u6270\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution.

Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, typically requiring matrix inversion at every iteration.

The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions.

However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions.

We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly.

Exact analytical and geometrical-optics-based models are first developed to explore fundamental design limits, followed by a semi-analytical formulation tailored to discrete, reconfigurable architectures.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0cXGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u20133\u5e74\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u65f6AUC\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8eFIB-4\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bfb\u6c42\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFIB-4\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u9632\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5ICA-9/10\u4ee3\u7801\u8bc6\u522b\u8102\u80aa\u809d\u60a3\u8005\u5e76\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u809d\u786c\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u809d\u786c\u5316\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3001\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u6307\u6570\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528XGBoost\u8bad\u7ec31\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u30013\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eFIB-4\u505aAUC\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u57281\u5e74\u30012\u5e74\u30013\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dAUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.81\u30010.73\u30010.69\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eFIB-4\u76840.71\u30010.63\u30010.57\uff1b\u8868\u73b0\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5ef6\u957f\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfFIB-4\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We developed an automated pipeline by fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to build two models: the Classifier-Rationalizer-Categorizer and the Thematic Mapper. By leveraging dynamic few-shot prompting and the model's large context size, our pipeline achieved over 97% precision and recall, significantly outperforming keyword-based and classical ML methods. We applied our pipeline to 91K Amazon reviews about fitness trackers, smart speakers and cameras, over multiple years. We found that on average 5% contained S&P concerns, while security camera exhibited the highest prevalence at 10%. Our method detected significantly more S&P-relevant reviews than prior works: 15x more for fitness trackers, 29% more for smart speakers, and 70% more for cameras. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that concerns like surveillance and data control have persisted for years, suggesting limited industry progress. We demonstrate that across all device types, users consistently demand more precise control over what data is collected and shared. We uncover challenges in multi-user and multi-device interactions, identifying two previously unreported themes concerning inadequate controls for account separation and data access.

In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission.

Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level. The shifted-window transformer design proposed here beat all baselines by a wide margin and set new best marks in spike-based neuronal infection classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $\u03bc$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation.

While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved.

We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called \"Twin Peaks\".

We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5229\u7528\u91ce\u5916\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u5b66\u903c\u771f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u771f\u5b9e/\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df2\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u91ce\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7279\u5f81+\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u91ce\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5df2\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u91ce\u5916\u6837\u672c\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u52a0\u5165\u91ce\u5916\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u65f6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8f83\u57fa\u7840\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6709\u660e\u663e\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91ce\u5916\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The framework enforces unanimous-release confidentiality through a dual-layer protection mechanism that combines per-client affine masking with priority-driven sequential consensus locking. Decentralized integrity is verified via step (sigma_S) and data (sigma_D) checksums, facilitating autonomous malicious deviation detection and atomic abort without requiring persistent coordination. The design supports scalar, vector, and matrix payloads with O(N*D) computation and communication complexity, optional edge-server offloading, and resistance to collusion under N-1 corruptions. Formal analysis proves correctness, Consensus-Dependent Integrity and Fairness (CDIF) with overwhelming-probability abort on deviation, and IND-CPA security assuming a pseudorandom function family. Empirical evaluations on MNIST-derived vectors demonstrate linear scalability up to N = 500 with sub-millisecond per-client computation times. The framework achieves 100% malicious deviation detection, exact data recovery, and three-to-four orders of magnitude lower FLOPs compared to MPC and HE baselines.

However, existing PEFT methods usually exhibit significant vulnerability to various noise and attacks on graph topology and node attributes/features. To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks validate the robustness and effectiveness of AGP method compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study aims to systematically characterize how autonomous coding agents contribute to software security in practice, how these security-related contributions are reviewed and accepted, and which observable signals are associated with PR rejection. We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems.

We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes.

Identifying these threats requires semantic understanding and structural reasoning that traditionally depend on symbolic, constraint-driven static analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a multi-category interaction threat taxonomy, assessing their performance on both the original openHAB (oHC/IoTB) dataset and a structurally challenging Mutation dataset designed to test robustness under rule transformations. We benchmark Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 70B, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 across zero-, one-, and two-shot settings, comparing their results against oHIT's manually validated ground truth. Our findings show that while LLMs exhibit promising semantic understanding, particularly on action- and condition-related threats, their accuracy degrades significantly for threats requiring cross-rule structural reasoning, especially under mutated rule forms. Model performance varies widely across threat categories and prompt settings, with no model providing consistent reliability.

We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\\% and random selection by 80.1\\%.

We identify four systemic vulnerabilities in LoRA-based federated systems and validate GAP across LLaMA, ChatGLM, and GPT-2.

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%.

Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types.

While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step.

This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.\n  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9216\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768416\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650", "method": "\u5bf916\u79cd\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cExplainable Boosting Machines\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0bSymbolic Regression\u548cInterpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u800cGeneralized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u5448\u73b0\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u5207\u5b9e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8ba4\u8bc6"}}

However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs).

While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles.

This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests.

Submitted for journal review", "summary": "Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts.

Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.\n  We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.\n  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests. We release the benchmark and maintain a live leaderboard for tracking verbosity behavior over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals.

The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost.

We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating \"average\" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance.

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5f0fsoft reparameterization\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u7684score\u2011function\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5e73\u6ed1\u903c\u8fd1\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5f97\u5230\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6280\u5de7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u3002"}}

We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions. After training, a neutral meta-code enables domain agnostic synthesis, while mixtures of meta-codes provide controllable multi-domain coverage. FedHypeVAE unifies personalization, privacy, and distribution alignment at the generator level, establishing a principled foundation for privacy-preserving data synthesis in federated settings.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\\text{MW}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c31\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8fa8\u522b LLM \u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 hallucination \u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\uff08Fiedler\u503c\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\u3001\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u8c31\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u9608\u503c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97 Cohen's d \u8fbe\u5230 3.30\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387 85.0\u201395.6%\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u53ef\u8fbe 93\u201395%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u533a\u5206\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
