Locate-then-edit methods, as a mainstream paradigm of model editing, offer a promising solution by modifying model parameters without retraining. However, in this work, we reveal a critical vulnerability of this paradigm: the parameter updates inadvertently serve as a side channel, enabling attackers to recover the edited data. We propose a two-stage reverse-engineering attack named \\textit{KSTER} (\\textbf{K}ey\\textbf{S}paceRecons\\textbf{T}ruction-then-\\textbf{E}ntropy\\textbf{R}eduction) that leverages the low-rank structure of these updates. First, we theoretically show that the row space of the update matrix encodes a ``fingerprint\" of the edited subjects, enabling accurate subject recovery via spectral analysis. Second, we introduce an entropy-based prompt recovery attack that reconstructs the semantic context of the edit. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our attacks can recover edited data with high success rates. Furthermore, we propose \\textit{subspace camouflage}, a defense strategy that obfuscates the update fingerprint with semantic decoys. This approach effectively mitigates reconstruction risks without compromising editing utility.

This study investigates how Canadian youth (aged 16-24) negotiate privacy with SVAs by developing and testing a structural model grounded in five key constructs: perceived privacy risks (PPR), perceived benefits (PPBf), algorithmic transparency and trust (ATT), privacy self-efficacy (PSE), and privacy-protective behaviors (PPB). A cross-sectional survey of N=469 youth was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results reveal that PSE is the strongest predictor of PPB, while the effect of ATT on PPB is fully mediated by PSE. This identifies a critical efficacy gap, where youth's confidence must first be built up for them to act. The model confirms that PPBf directly discourages protective action, yet also indirectly fosters it by slightly boosting self-efficacy. These findings empirically validate and extend earlier qualitative work, quantifying how policy overload and hidden controls erode the self-efficacy necessary for protective action.

Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction.

Version of record: https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3063655", "summary": "Atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects cause phase aberrations in propagating light waves, thereby reducing effectiveness in transmitting and receiving coherent light from an aircraft. Existing optical sensors can measure the resulting phase aberrations, but the physical experiments required to induce these aberrations are expensive and time-intensive. Simulation methods could provide a less expensive alternative. For example, an existing simulation algorithm called boiling flow, which generalizes the Taylor frozen-flow method, can generate synthetic phase aberration data (i.e., phase screens) induced by atmospheric turbulence. However, boiling flow depends on physical parameters, such as the Fried coherence length r0, which are not well-defined for aero-optic effects. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the parameters of boiling flow from measured aero-optic phase aberration data. Our algorithm estimates these parameters to fit the spatial and temporal statistics of the measured data. This method is computationally efficient and our experiments show that the temporal power spectral density of the slopes of the synthetic phase screens reasonably matches that of the measured phase aberrations from two turbulent boundary layer data sets, with errors between 8-9%. However, the Kolmogorov spatial structure function of the phase screens does not match that of the measured phase aberrations, with errors above 28%. This suggests that, while the parameters of boiling flow can reasonably fit the temporal statistics of highly convective data, they cannot fit the complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1 boili...", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5927\u6c14\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u7578\u53d8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u4f4d\u7578\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u62df\u5408 Boiling Flow \u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u65f6\u95f4\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee 8-9%\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u51fd\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u8d85 28%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u5339\u914d\u4e0d\u8db3", "conclusion": "\u5728\u62df\u5408\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0cboiling flow \u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u8f83\u597d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6574\u63cf\u8ff0\u822a\u7a7a\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u4f4d\u7578\u53d8"}}

TPRA questionnaires are typically drawn from large repositories of security and compliance questions, yet tailoring assessments to organizational needs remains a largely manual process. Existing retrieval approaches rely on keyword or surface-level similarity, which often fails to capture implicit assessment scope and control semantics.\n  This paper explores strategies for organizing and retrieving TPRA cybersecurity questions using semantic labels that describe both control domains and assessment scope. We compare direct question-level labeling with a Large Language Model (LLM) against a hybrid semi-supervised semantic labeling (SSSL) pipeline that clusters questions in embedding space, labels a small representative subset using an LLM, and propagates labels to remaining questions using k-Nearest Neighbors; we also compare downstream retrieval based on direct question similarity versus retrieval in the label space. We find that semantic labels can improve retrieval alignment when labels are discriminative and consistent, and that SSSL can generalize labels from a small labeled subset to large repositories while substantially reducing LLM usage and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u6539\u8fdbTPRA\u95ee\u9898\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u534a\u76d1\u7763SSSL\u7ba1\u9053\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5e93\u6807\u7b7e\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TPRA\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6216\u8868\u5c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9690\u542b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u624b\u5de5\u5b9a\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7e41\u7410\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u2460\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u2461\u6784\u5efa\u534a\u76d1\u7763SSSL\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u6311\u9009\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4ea4\u7ed9LLM\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528k-\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb(kNN)\u5c06\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u2462\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e vs \u539f\u59cb\u95ee\u9898\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5f53\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5339\u914d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0cSSSL\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u4ec5\u6807\u8bb0\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u8c03\u7528\u91cf\u4e0e\u8d39\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u5177\u6709\u5224\u522b\u529b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff1b\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0(SSSL)\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u5bf9\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u5c06\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed9\u5176\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53cc\u65b9\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8ba1\u91cf\u66ff\u4ee3\u71b5\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e26\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5176\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53cc\u65b9\u5747\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7b26\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\uff08PSC\uff09\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u53cc\u65b9\u7ef4\u62a4\u5171\u4eab\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93\u521b\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ea0\u6b63\u63a5\u6536\u65b9\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u53d1\u9001\u65b9\u5b9e\u9645\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u533a\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e26\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4fa7\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "PSC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u71b5\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8054\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results.

Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the measurement data during transmission from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS, leading to disrupted EV charging. Therefore, to ensure reliable voltage data under such sensor attacks, this paper proposes a two-stage error-corrected self-learning Koopman operator-based secure voltage estimation scheme for large-format battery packs. The first stage of correction compensates for the Koopman approximation error. The second stage aims to recover the error amassing from the lack of higher-order battery dynamics information in the self-learning feedback, using two alternative methods: an adaptable empirical strategy that uses cell-level knowledge of open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for pack-level estimation, and a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method that leverages minimal data-training. During our comprehensive case studies using the high-fidelity battery simulation package 'PyBaMM-liionpack', our proposed secure estimator reliably generated real-time voltage estimation with high accuracy under varying pack topologies, charging settings, battery age-levels, and attack policies. Thus, the scalable and adaptable algorithm can be easily employed to diverse battery configurations and operating conditions, without requiring significant modifications, excessive data or sensor redundancy, to ensure optimum charging of EVs under compromised sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e91\u7aefBMS\u53d7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7535\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u7834\u574fEV\u5145\u7535\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60Koopman\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u6821\u6b63\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u4f30\u8ba1\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5145\u7535\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fdd\u969c\u4e91\u7aef\u7535\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u7535\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u4e2d\u65ad\uff1b", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60 Koopman \u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u5b89\u5168\u7535\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8865\u507f Koopman \u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u7f3a\u5c11\u9ad8\u9636\u7535\u6c60\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u2014\u2014\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4f53\u5f00\u8def\u7535\u538b\u4e0e\u8377\u7535\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728 PyBaMM\u2011liionpack \u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7535\u6c60\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5305\u62d3\u6251\u3001\u5145\u7535\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u8001\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7535\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7535\u6c60\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4fee\u6539\u3001\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u6700\u4f73\u5145\u7535\u3002"}}

However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD).

However, existing channel estimation methods often overlook the structured sparsity and clustering characteristics inherent in realistic clustered delay line (CDL) channels, leading to degraded performance in practical systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian learning (NPBL) framework for OTFS channel estimation. Specifically, a stick-breaking process is introduced to automatically infer the number of multipath components and assign each path to its corresponding cluster. The channel coefficients within each cluster are modeled by a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture complex fading statistics.

First, the aeroelastic system is modeled as two-dimensional coupled wave PDEs with internal anti-damping terms, derived by Piston theory and Hamilton's principle. Using Fourier series expansion, the 2-D problem is decomposed into a parameterized family of 1-D systems. For each mode, a full-state boundary feedback controller is designed via PDE backstepping transformation. To enable output-feedback implementation, a state observer is further designed to estimate the distributed states over the two-dimensional spatial domain. Through Lyapunov analysis, the exponential stability of the 2-D elastic plate PDE under the proposed boundary control is established with a designer-tunable decay rate.

In wideband and scattering-rich environments, clutter often dominates weak target reflections and becomes a fundamental bottleneck for reliable sensing. Practical ISAC clutter includes \"cold\" clutter arising from environmental backscatter of the probing waveform, and \"hot\" clutter induced by external interference and reflections from the environment whose statistics can vary rapidly over time. In this article, we develop a unified wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) signal model that captures both clutter types across the space, time, and frequency domains. Building on this model, we review clutter characterization at multiple levels, including amplitude statistics, robust spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) modeling, and structured covariance representations suitable for limited-snapshot regimes. We then summarize receiver-side suppression methods in the temporal and spatial domains, together with extensions to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and space-frequency-time adaptive processing (SFTAP), and we provide guidance on selecting techniques under different waveform and interference conditions. To move beyond reactive suppression, we discuss clutter-aware transceiver co-design that couples beamforming and waveform optimization with practical communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints to enable proactive clutter avoidance.

We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.\n  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MVN-Grad\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u518d\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u91cf\u7684 Adam \u98ce\u683c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u573a\u666f\u907f\u514d\u7b26\u53f7\u5d29\u584c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728 CIFAR-100 \u4e0e GPT \u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a Adam \u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "Adam \u7b49\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53d7\u5230\u968f\u673a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5668\u4e0e\u65e7\u52a8\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u79bb\u7fa4\u68af\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5d29\u584c\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u91cf-\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5148\u540e\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4f20\u7edf Adam \u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Cifar-100 \u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c GPT \u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMVN-Grad \u4e0e Adam\u3001AdaBelief\u3001LaProp \u76f8\u6bd4\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u4efb\u4f55\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MVN-Grad \u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u518d\u65bd\u52a0\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f7b\u5e95\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f7f\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u5c16\u5cf0\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5d29\u584c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7 Adam\u3001AdaBelief \u4e0e LaProp\u3002"}}

This paper presents a dual-loop architecture that combines an inner-loop non-minimum-phase resonant controller (NRC) for active damping with an outer-loop tracking controller augmented by a constant-gain, lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset element to provide phase lead at the targeted crossover without increasing loop gain. We show that aggressively tuned CgLp designs with larger phase lead can introduce pronounced higher-order harmonics, degrading error sensitivity in specific frequency bands and causing multiple-reset behavior. To address this, a shaping filter is introduced in the reset-trigger path to regulate the reset action and suppress harmonic-induced effects while preserving the desired crossover-phase recovery. The proposed controllers are implemented in real time on an industrial piezo nanopositioner, demonstrating an experimental open-loop crossover increase of approximately 55~Hz and a closed-loop bandwidth improvement of about 34~Hz relative to a well-tuned linear baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cd\u7f6e\u53cc\u73af\u63a7\u5236+\u6ce2\u5f62\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7535\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u5e26\u5bbd\u224834\u202fHz\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u70b9\u224855\u202fHz\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u963b\u5c3c\u8c10\u632f\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u8f7b\u5ea6\u963b\u5c3c\u8c10\u632f\u4e0e\u589e\u76ca-\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8154\u538b\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5185\u90e8\u73af\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c10\u632f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08NRC\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u963b\u5c3c\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u73af\u91c7\u7528\u5e38\u6570\u589e\u76ca\u3001\u524d\u9988\u76f8\u4f4d\uff08CgLp\uff09\u91cd\u7f6e\u5143\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8d8a\u70b9\u76f8\u4f4d\u524d\u7f6e\u4e14\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u73af\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cd\u7f6e\u89e6\u53d1\u8def\u5f84\u52a0\u5165\u6ce2\u5f62\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8c03\u8282\u91cd\u7f6e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u538b\u7535\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f00\u73af\u8de8\u8d8a\u70b9\u63d0\u5347\u7ea655\u202fHz\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u5347\u7ea634\u202fHz\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7cbe\u8c03\u7ebf\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u73af\u91cd\u7f6e + \u8c03\u8282\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u76f8\u4f4d\u8865\u507f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8c10\u6ce2\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u538b\u7535\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u53d7\u963b\u5c3c\u8c10\u632f\u9650\u5236\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small.

To bridge this gap, we establish a modality-semantics decoupling principle and construct the AdvBench-Omni dataset, which reveals a significant vulnerability in OLLMs. Mechanistic analysis uncovers a Mid-layer Dissolution phenomenon driven by refusal vector magnitude shrinkage, alongside the existence of a modal-invariant pure refusal direction.

This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF).

Conventional CACC relies on feedback linearization, assuming exact vehicle parameters; however, longitudinal vehicle dynamics are nonlinear and subject to parametric uncertainty. Applying feedback linearization with a nominal model yields imperfect cancellation, leading to model mismatch and degraded performance with off-the-shelf CACC controllers. To improve robustness without redesigning the CACC law, we explicitly model the mismatch between the ideal closed-loop dynamics assumed by the CACC design and the actual dynamics under parametric uncertainties. Robustness is formulated as an $\\mathcal{L}_2$ trajectory-matching problem, minimizing the energy of this mismatch to make the uncertain system behave as closely as possible to the ideal model. This objective is addressed by optimizing over plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations that preserve the nominal closed-loop behavior while mitigating the effects of parametric uncertainty.

However, their gains are limited by random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and regulatory emission constraints. This paper develops a stochastic reliability framework for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks by modeling the desired and interfering channels, receiver noise, and RIS amplifier noise as random variables. The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling.\n  To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits.\n  We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8RIS\u536b\u661f\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673aSINR\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eSAA\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u843d\u5dee\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aMISOCP\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u914d\u5957\u7684SINR\u5305\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6027\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8RIS\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u53d7\u968f\u673a\u5171\u4fe1\u9053\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u653e\u5927\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u6cd5\u89c4\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u5236\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u843d\u5dee\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u968f\u673aSINR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6837\u672c\u5e73\u5747\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08SAA\uff09\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u843d\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u5316\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u95ee\u9898\uff08MISOCP\uff09\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u6c42\u89e3SINR\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5f81\u503c\u548cl1\u8303\u6570\u7684SINR\u5305\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684SINR\u5305\u7edc\u7d27\u8d34\u5b9e\u9645SINR\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9971\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684MISOCP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b8c\u5584\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u8bbe\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u536b\u661f\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u653e\u5927\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\u843d\u5dee\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels.

In current practice, detection relies primarily on topology-aware residual-based tests that assume malicious measurements can be distinguished from normal operation through physical inconsistency reflected in abnormal residual behavior. This paper shows that this assumption does not always hold: when FDIA scenarios produce manipulated measurements that remain on the measurement manifold induced by AC power flow relations and measurement redundancy, residual-based detectors may fail to distinguish them from nominal data. The resulting detectability limitation is a property of the measurement manifold itself and does not depend on the attacker's detailed knowledge of the physical system model. To make this limitation observable in practice, we present a data-driven constructive mechanism that incorporates the generic functional structure of AC power flow to generate physically consistent, manifold-constrained perturbations, providing a concrete witness of how residual-based detectors can be bypassed. Numerical studies on multiple AC test systems characterize the conditions under which detection becomes challenging and illustrate its failure modes. The results highlight fundamental limits of residual-based detection in AC state estimation and motivate the need for complementary defenses beyond measurement consistency tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b8b\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684FDIA\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u8be5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u6551\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u884c\u6b8b\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u80fd\u5f25\u8865\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06AC\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u878d\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d41\u5f62\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cdAC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5957AC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u653b\u51fb\u4fe1\u53f7\u5145\u5206\u914d\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d41\u5f62\u65f6\u6b8b\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u51fa\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728AC\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u603b\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4f2a\u9020\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff08FDIA\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e9b\u5927\u6c14\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728AC\u6d41\u52a8\u5173\u7cfb\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b8b\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u4f7f\u7528\u8865\u5145\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems.

Such interference departs from the assumptions underlying conventional detection methods based on Gaussian noise models and leads to detection mismatch that fundamentally affects symbol-level performance. In particular, the presence of random interference amplitude and non-uniform phase alters the structure of the optimal decision regions and renders standard Euclidean distance-based detectors suboptimal. To address this challenge, we develop the maximum-likelihood Gaussian-phase approximate (ML-G) detector, a low-complexity detection rule that accurately approximates maximum-likelihood detection while remaining suitable for practical implementation. The proposed detector explicitly incorporates the statistical properties of the interference and induces decision regions that differ significantly from those arising under conventional metrics. Building on the ML-G framework, we further investigate constellation design under interference-aware detection and formulate an optimization problem that seeks symbol placements that minimize the symbol error probability subject to an average energy constraint. The resulting constellations are obtained numerically and adapt to the interference environment, exhibiting non-standard and asymmetric structures as interference strength increases. Simulation results demonstrate clear symbol error probability gains over established benchmark schemes across a range of interference conditions, particularly in scenarios with dominant additive interference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9Nakagami\u2011m\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6ML\u2011G\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ca\u5e72\u6270\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b26\u53f7\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684Nakagami\u2011m\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6ML\u2011G\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5e72\u6270\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u661f\u5ea7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u6ee1\u8db3\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7b26\u53f7\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u661f\u5ea7\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0cML\u2011G\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u52a0\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u663e\u793a\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u9ad8\u65af\u76f8\u4f4d\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08ML\u2011G\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728Nakagami-m\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Real workflows involve splicing, quoting, trimming, and platform-level transforms that may preserve some regions while altering others. Neural watermarking systems have made strides in robustness and localised detection, but most deployments produce outputs with no third-party verifiable cryptographic proof tying a time segment to an issuer-signed original. Provenance standards like C2PA adopt signed manifests and Merkle-based fragment validation, yet their bindings target encoded assets and break under re-encoding or routine processing.\n  We propose MerkleSpeech, a system for public-key verifiable, chunk-localised speech provenance offering two tiers of assurance. The first, a robust watermark attribution layer (WM-only), survives common distribution transforms and answers \"was this chunk issued by a known party?\". The second, a strict cryptographic integrity layer (MSv1), verifies Merkle inclusion of the chunk's fingerprint under an issuer signature. The system computes perceptual fingerprints over short speech chunks, commits them in a Merkle tree whose root is signed with an issuer key, and embeds a compact in-band watermark payload carrying a random content identifier and chunk metadata sufficient to retrieve Merkle inclusion proofs from a repository. Once the payload is extracted, all subsequent verification steps (signature check, fingerprint recomputation, Merkle inclusion) use only public information. The result is a splice-aware timeline indicating which regions pass each tier and why any given region fails.

By contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of the dependence of LoRA's accuracy on update rank remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRA \u7684\u79e9-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u7528\u95ed\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u540c\u6b65/\u987a\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b\u79e9\u00a01\u00a0\u7684 LoRA \u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u671f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e LoRA\uff08\u79e9\u00a01\u00a0\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u53ef\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u79e9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5168\u79e9\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f LoRA \u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f97\u5230 LoRA \u79e9\u00a0r \u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9 trace\u2011squared \u4e0e Frobenius\u2011norm \u635f\u5931\u6c42\u89e3\u6536\u655b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\uff0cLoRA \u79e9\u00a0r \u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u79e9\u65f6\u4e5f\u53ef\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u9610\u660e LoRA \u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u79e9\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u635f\u5931\uff08trace\u2011squared \u4e0e Frobenius\u2011norm\uff09\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u8bba\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u8fd8\u662f\u987a\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bf4\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u79e9\u00a01\u00a0\u7684\u6781\u9650\u4e0b LoRA \u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A representative example of this class has recently been employed in the power electronics literature to implement a grid-forming controller. We show that, under certain conditions, these port-Hamiltonian systems, when interconnected with passive systems, converge to a prescribed non-equilibrium steady state. At first glance, the apparently passive nature of the port-Hamiltonian system seems incompatible with the active power injection required to sustain this non-equilibrium condition. However, we demonstrate that the discontinuity inherent in the vector field provides the additional energy needed to maintain this operating point, indicating that the system is not globally passive. Moreover, when the discontinuity is replaced by a continuous approximation, the resulting system becomes cyclo-dissipative while still capable of supplying the required power.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Submitted to journal", "summary": "In signal processing, the data collected from sensing devices is often a noisy linear superposition of multiple components, and the estimation of components of interest constitutes a crucial pre-processing step. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DiG\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u901a\u8fc7Gibbs + PnP\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u591a\u91cd\u6210\u5206\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7ebf\u6027\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u5206\u662f\u5173\u952e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u73b0\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaBayesian\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Gibbs\u91c7\u6837\u4e0ePlug\u2011and\u2011Play\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210DiG\uff08Diffusion\u2011in\u2011Gibbs\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff1b\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u5355\u72ec\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u7075\u6d3b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0cDiG\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5bf9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u5b50\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "DiG\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5f97\u5230\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\u4e14\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most available methods either exploit particular symmetries of the PDE or address problems posed on parallelepiped domains. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach that enables the design of backstepping controllers on non-parallelepiped regions without symmetry assumptions is the domain extension technique. This method, however, presents several drawbacks. In particular, the control input at each time instant is obtained by simulating a PDE on an extended domain, from which the actual input on the original domain is approximated. By contrast, in the one-dimensional setting, once the time-independent backstepping gain kernel is known, the control input can be computed in closed form as a feedback depending solely on the state at that same instant. Moreover, problems such as output-feedback design or adaptive and robust control do not appear straightforward to address with the domain extension method, at least to the best of our knowledge. These considerations motivate the search, whenever possible, for alternatives that preserve the main advantages of one-dimensional backstepping. A motivating example for the domain extension method is the control of the heat equation on a piano-shaped domain, with actuation applied at the tail of the piano. In this extended abstract, we show through a simple calculation that the domain extension method is not required in this setting. Instead, a strategy akin to that used for parallelepiped domains can be adopted. This result constitutes a first instance of a broader framework for backstepping control of asymmetric PDEs posed on non-parallelepiped regions, which we refer to as domains with graph-monotone boundaries. The general framework is developed in a forthcoming paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u884c\u516d\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u94a2\u7434\u5f62\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u57df\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6784\u9020\u95ed\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u80cc\u5411\u629b\u7269\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u80cc\u5411\u629b\u7269\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6216\u5e73\u884c\u516d\u9762\u4f53\u57df\uff1b\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u95ed\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u96be\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f93\u51fa\u53cd\u9988/\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u884c\u516d\u9762\u4f53\u533a\u95f4\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5e73\u884c\u516d\u9762\u4f53\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u5355\u8c03\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6784\u9020\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u57df\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df PDE \u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u94a2\u7434\u5f62\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u662f\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u8ff0\u56fe\u5355\u8c03\u8fb9\u754c\u7b56\u7565\u5373\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u540c\u7b49\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u884c\u516d\u9762\u4f53\u3001\u65e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff08\u56fe\u5355\u8c03\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u80cc\u5411\u629b\u7269\u65b9\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u94a2\u7434\u5f62\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions.

Large-scale training and inference increasingly depend on tightly coupled data centers, high-capacity optical networks, and energy systems operating close to physical and environmental limits. As a result, control over data and algorithms alone is no longer sufficient to achieve meaningful AI sovereignty. Practical sovereignty now depends on who can deploy, operate, and adapt AI infrastructure under constraints imposed by energy availability, sustainability targets, and network reach. This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce 5Gone, a powerful software-defined radio (SDR)-based uplink overshadowing attack method against 5G-SA. 5Gone exploits deficiencies in the 3GPP standard to perform surgical, covert denial-of-service, privacy, and downgrade attacks. Uplink overshadowing means that an attacker is transmitting at exactly the same time and frequency as the victim UE, but with a slightly higher output power. 5Gone runs on a COTS x86 computer without any need for dedicated hardware acceleration and can overshadow commercial 100 MHz cells with an E2E latency of less than 500$\u03bc$s, which up to now has not been possible with any software-based UE implementation.

Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse.

Pasareanu", "Matt Fredrikson"], "title": "SecCodePRM: A Process Reward Model for Code Security", "comment": "20 pages", "summary": "Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff.", "AI": {"tldr": "SecCodePRM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b65\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5668\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u4ee3\u7801\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6216\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u7f00\u7ea7\u522b\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5668\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u9010\u6b65\u76d1\u7763\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u9010\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6392\u540d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5019\u9009\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u7ee7\u7eed\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSecCodePRM\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6216\u57fa\u4e8eLLM/GNN\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "SecCodePRM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u672a\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7528\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002"}}

See https://github.com/inkitori/taudio/", "summary": "Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891LM\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528\u5e27\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc750\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edftoken\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u9519\u8bef", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891LM\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u5e27\u7ea7\u522b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6cca\u677e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u635f\u5931\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e8b\u4ef6", "result": "\u5728\u8bcd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347>50\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u5e27\u7ea7\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}

We introduce authenticated workflows, the first complete trust layer for enterprise agentic AI. Security reduces to protecting four fundamental boundaries: prompts, tools, data, and context. We enforce intent (operations satisfy organizational policies) and integrity (operations are cryptographically authentic) at every boundary crossing, combining cryptographic elimination of attack classes with runtime policy enforcement. This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies.

We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling.

In this work, we compare the efficacy of deploying CBCP and DBCP in reducing user costs and increasing toll revenues. We first formulate a non-atomic congestion game in which low-income users receive a travel credit or toll discount for accessing tolled lanes. We establish that, in our formulation, Nash equilibrium flows always exist and can be computed or well approximated via convex programming. Our main result establishes a set of practically relevant conditions under which DBCP provably outperforms CBCP in inducing equilibrium outcomes that minimize a given societal cost, which encodes user cost reduction and toll revenue maximization.

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.\n  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.\n  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement.

Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934UAV\u5728\u4e0e\u8239\u8236\u534f\u540c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u964d\u4e00\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591aUAV\u4f5c\u6218\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d77\u4e0a\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u65e0GPS\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u4e07\u5411\u7535\u5149\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684UAV\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6613\u5355\u70b9\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u4e07\u5411\u6444\u50cf\u5934UAV\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u8239\u8236\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u8f83\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e00\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b\u534f\u540c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934UAV\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4e07\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6210\u672c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591aUAV\u534f\u540c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5728GPS\u906e\u65ad\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees.

These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing.

However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes.

In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control.\n  We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA).

However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders.

Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\uff0cR2RAG\u2011Flood\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6d2a\u707e\u540e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u623f\u4ea7\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u4e00\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002R2RAG-Flood\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5148\u9a8c\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u529b\u6c42\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u518d\u6b21\u63d0\u632f\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b3\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u548c\u7c7b\u539f\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u6765\u8865\u5145\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3aPrompt\uff1b4\uff09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u53d1\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a\u5148\u5224\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u518d\u7ec6\u5316\u5230\u4e09\u7b49\u7ea7PDE\uff1b5\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u964d\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9884\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5fb7\u5dde\u54c8\u91cc\u65af\u53bf\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u73870.714\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u73870.859\uff1bR2RAG-Flood\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u5e95\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fbe\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u73870.613\u20130.668\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u73870.757\u20130.896\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u7531\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eAPI\u4e0eGPU\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6548\u76ca\u5ea6\u91cf\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7R2RAG-Flood\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "R2RAG-Flood\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6d2a\u707e\u540e\u623f\u4ea7\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Despite their popularity, these apps often integrate complex analytics, advertising, and attribution infrastructures that may introduce privacy and security risks. Existing research has primarily focused on tracking behaviors or monetization models, leaving configuration-level privacy exposure and children-oriented apps underexplored. In this study, we conducted a comparative static analysis of Android mobile games to investigate privacy and security risks beyond permission usage. The analysis follows a three-phase methodology comprising (i) designing study protocol, (ii) Android Package Kit (APK) collection and static inspection, and (iii) data analysis. We examined permissions, manifest-level configuration properties (e.g., backup settings, cleartext network traffic, and exported components), and embedded third-party Software Development Kit (SDK) ecosystems across children-oriented and general-audience mobile games. The extracted indicators are synthesized into qualitative privacy-risk categories to support comparative reporting. The results showed that while children-oriented games often request fewer permissions, they frequently exhibit configuration-level risks and embed third-party tracking SDKs similar to general-audience games. Architectural and configuration decisions play a critical role in shaping privacy risks, particularly for apps targeting children.

By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training. Empirically, PUMA speeds up pretraining at the 125M scale by $\\approx 2.5\\times$ and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization.

High-stakes smart contracts often rely on timely alerts about external events, but prior work has not analyzed their resilience to an attacker suppressing alerts via bribery. We formalize this challenge in a cryptoeconomic setting as the \\emph{alerting problem}, giving rise to a game between a bribing adversary and~$n$ rational participants, who pay a penalty if they are caught deviating from the protocol. We establish a quadratic, i.e.,~$O(n^2)$, upper bound, whereas a straightforward alerting protocol only achieves~$O(n)$ bribery cost.\n  We present a \\emph{simultaneous game} that asymptotically achieves the quadratic upper bound and thus asymptotically-optimal bribery resistance. We then present two protocols that implement our simultaneous game: The first leverages a strong network synchrony assumption. The second relaxes this strong assumption and instead takes advantage of trusted hardware and blockchain proof-of-publication to establish a timed commitment scheme. These two protocols are constant-time but incur a linear storage overhead on the blockchain. We analyze a third, \\emph{sequential alerting} protocol that optimistically incurs no on-chain storage overhead, at the expense of~$O(n)$ worst-case execution time.

We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise.

We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns.

In this work, we study unsupervised window-level insider threat detection on the CERT r4.2 dataset and show that explicitly separating activity presence from activity magnitude yields substantial performance gains.

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2.

However, current incumbent protection mechanisms face critical limitations. The Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) requires costly sensor deployments and remains vulnerable to interference and security risks. Alternatively, the Incumbent Informing Capability (IIC) requires IUs to disclose their identities and operational parameters to the Spectrum Coordination System (SCS), creating linkable records that compromise operational privacy and mission secrecy. We propose IU-GUARD, a privacy-preserving spectrum sharing framework that enables IUs to access spectrum without revealing their identities. Leveraging verifiable credentials (VCs) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), IU-GUARD allows IUs to prove their authorization to the SCS while disclosing only essential operational parameters. This decouples IU identity from spectrum access, prevents cross-request linkage, and mitigates the risk of centralized SCS data leakage. We implement a prototype, and our evaluation shows that IU-GUARD achieves strong privacy guarantees with practical computation and communication overhead, making it suitable for real-time DSS deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIU-GUARD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528VC\u4e0eZKP\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6cc4\u9732\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u89d2\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u5236\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u6602\u8d35\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u6216\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e3b\u89d2\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51ed\u8bc1(VC)\u4e0e\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e(ZKP)\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3b\u89d2\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u534f\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf(SCS)\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u4ec5\u62ab\u9732\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u8026\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIU-GUARD\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51ed\u8bc1\u548c\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cIU-GUARD\u5728\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6388\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002"}}

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions.

For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.\n  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the \"degree of alignment\" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease.

While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels.

We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances.

Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA.

We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference.

Dhillon"], "title": "LUCID: Attention with Preconditioned Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Softmax-based dot-product attention is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, enabling remarkable capabilities such as in-context learning. However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it.

Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates.

We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively.

However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO).

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets.

In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.\n  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\\prime}\\in\\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\\geq \\text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \\emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\\ker(F)$.

Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation.

Mitchell", "Chao Wang"], "title": "Analyzing Fairness of Neural Network Prediction via Counterfactual Dataset Generation", "comment": "Presented at NLDL 2026", "summary": "Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation.

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold.

To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory.

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data.

Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences.

To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $\u03bc$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits.

The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions.

Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain.

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\u0394R := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\u0394R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|\u0394R|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa TRACE \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u9879\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u7528\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 \u2203Q \u66ff\u6362\u539f\u6709\u6e90\u57df\u6a21\u578b Q \u65f6\uff0c\u6e90\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316 \u0394R \u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u9879\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u53d8\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u60e9\u7f5a\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u4f4d\u8f93\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8f93\u8fd0\uff08\u6216MMD\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u53d8\u60e9\u7f5a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\uff1b\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u5219\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0 TRACE \u7684\u5168\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u6210/\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\uff0cTRACE \u4e0a\u754c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u7684\u7f29\u653e\uff1b\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u95e8\u63a7\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e |\u0394R|\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0cAUROC/AUPRC \u4ea6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TRACE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u9879\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e90\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u8ddd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u8bc4\u5206\u3002"}}

In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed.

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications.

While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5408\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u5927\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u5df2\u77e5\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7684 DP \u65b9\u6848\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4ecd\u662f\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u62ab\u9732\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u6cc4\u9732\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7684 MIMIC\u2011IV \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u533b\u9662\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5957\u6210\u719f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u53e6\u5916\u4f7f\u7528 eICU \u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u5728 MIMIC\u2011IV \u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u73b0\u6709 DP \u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5374\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u4f46\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCG-BGs\uff1a\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4ece\u529b\u5339\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684PMF\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86BG\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfBG\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5750\u6807\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u529b\u5339\u914d\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u52bf\u5e73\u5747\u529b\uff08PMF\uff09\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u52bf\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fdd\u771f\u91c7\u6837\u5e76\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "CG-BGs\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u6eb6\u5242\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CG-BGs\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5750\u6807\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684PMF\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u91c7\u6837\u5927\u578b\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5e03\u6717\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality.

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows.

Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse.

While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies.

These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality.

For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We secret-share the watermark key $\u03c4$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\u03c4$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification.

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution.

Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASC\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6570\u7ec4\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7edf\u4e00\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c11\u6570\u7ec4\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002\u52a0\u6743\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u7ec4\u4e0d\u5229\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0e\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "ASC\u5728\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u727a\u7272\u603b\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ASC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5404\u7ec4\u9690\u79c1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u5dee\u7ec4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks.

Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage).

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument.

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds.

Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts.

Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior.

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster).

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios.

Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%.

Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset.

The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows.

Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime.

Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%.

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u628a\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4ece\u4ec5\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6bd4\u8fc7\u53bb\u66f4\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4e0b\u6e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u4f18\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u6291\u5236\u6765\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u2014\u2014\u5373\u4f7f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u65f6\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u900a\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5355\u4e00\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u591a\u91cd\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning.
