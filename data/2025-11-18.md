### [1] [HetDAPAC: Leveraging Attribute Heterogeneity in Distributed Attribute-Based Private Access Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11549)

TL;DR: HetDAPAC extends distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC) to handle heterogeneous privacy requirements by off-loading verification of non-sensitive attributes to a central server while keeping sensitive attributes in the distributed setup. This yields higher download rates and different trade-offs between privacy and balance of load.

Motivation: In distributed attribute-based access control, privacy concerns restrict the achievable rate. Not all user attributes are equally sensitive, so there is a need to exploit heterogeneous privacy requirements to improve performance.

Method: Introduce HetDAPAC framework with two schemes. First scheme off-loads verification of N-D attributes to a central server, achieving a rate of 1/(K+1) but sacrificing privacy for some non-sensitive attributes. Second scheme enforces balanced per-server download, achieving a rate of (D+1)/(2KD) across N servers.

Result: First HetDAPAC scheme improves the rate from 1/(2K) (in DAPAC) to 1/(K+1) with some privacy leakage for non-sensitive attributes. The second scheme provides a balanced download across servers with rate (D+1)/(2KD).

Conclusion: HetDAPAC demonstrates that incorporating heterogeneous privacy requirements can improve the efficiency (rate) of private attribute verification in distributed setups, offering a trade-off between privacy leakage and download balance, with two concrete schemes presenting different performance/privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.
