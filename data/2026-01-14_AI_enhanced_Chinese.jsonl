In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u53ea\u80fd\u6bcf\u5faa\u74b0\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u94fe\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6ede\u540e\u4f18\u5148\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u671f\u671b\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u5e26\u5355\u7b26\u53f7\u524d\u77bb\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u60c5\u5f62\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u79bb\u7ebf\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u540c\u6b65\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6761 DNA \u94fe\uff0c\u53d7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 DNA \u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0a\u754c/\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u6761\u94fe\u5728\u5355\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u671f\u671b\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6ede\u540e\u4f18\u5148\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u60c5\u51b5\u5f15\u5165\u5355\u7b26\u53f7\u524d\u77bb\uff1b\u5236\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u6700\u4f18\u79bb\u7ebf\u6392\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d6\u5f97\u671f\u671b\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u754c (q+3)L/2\uff0c\u6ede\u540e\u4f18\u5148\u53ef\u8fbe\u6b64\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u65e0\u524d\u77bb\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u6b64\u754c\uff1b\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5141\u8bb8\u5355\u7b26\u53f7\u524d\u77bb\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81f3 7L/3\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6392\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b DNA \u5408\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.\n  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.\n  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC.

Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes\" and ``parts\" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order\" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $\u0394^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $\u0394^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $\u0394^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $\u0394^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $\u0394^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $\u0394^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $\u0394^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $\u0394^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $\u0394^{k}$, which we term $\u0393^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies.

Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ENACHI\u53cc\u5c42\u8c03\u5ea6+\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u738743%\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u801762%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faENACHI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42Lyapunov\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u5305\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u533a\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u786e\u5b9a\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u80fd\u91cf-\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6298\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u8ddf\u8e2a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u534743.12%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e62.13%\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u62e5\u6324\u573a\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u8017\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "ENACHI\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control.

Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization.

Code can be found at: https://github.com/glam-imperial/AffectEffect", "summary": "Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316CL\u5728EEG\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56e0\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u529f\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u524d\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3EEG\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u672a\u77e5\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u6cdb\u5316\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7c7b\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5(EWC\u3001SI\u3001MAS)\u5728DREAMER\u548cSEED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u2011\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u6298\u8877\u4e0a\u504f\u5411\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u589e\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u8861\u7f3a\u5931\u53ca\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u5747\u9650\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6b63\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u578b\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9EEG\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7684\u7b56\u7565"}}

The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models.

Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers.

However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers.

To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\\mathbf H\\in\\mathbb F_2^{r\\times n}$ such that $\\mathbf H\\mathbf H^\\top = \\mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.\n  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.\n  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce \\textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning.

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs.

Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \\textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers.

NOVAK adopts a dual-mode architecture consisting of a streamlined fast path designed for production. The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers.

Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.\n  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware.

Results demonstrate that freezing significantly enhances the dynamic strength and brittleness of saturated sandstone.The pore structure undergoes substantial evolution with decreasing temperature, with the porosity increasing by 63.15%.Based on PFC3D microscopic simulations, the mechanism of frost heave damage and the regulatory effect of water-ice phase transition on rock mechanical behaviors are elucidated.A quantitative analysis method for energy dissipation is proposed, revealing that the energy absorption increment of frozen rocks is higher than that of room-temperature samples.The findings provide a theoretical basis and technical support for optimizing blasting parameters, realizing directional energy release,and promoting green construction of frozen rock masses in high-altitude areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f4e\u6e29\u4f1a\u4f7f\u9ad8\u539f\u51b0\u51bb\u7802\u5ca9\u66f4\u8106\u3001\u5b54\u9699\u589e\u5927\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5438\u6536\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u539f\u77ff\u4e1a\u7206\u7834\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u65bd\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u539f\u5730\u533a\u77ff\u4ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u6e29\u542b\u6c34\u51bb\u5ca9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7206\u7834\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u65bd\u5de5\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u573a\u53d6\u6837\u3001\u4f4e\u538b\u4f4e\u6e29\u6a21\u62df\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u51b2\u51fb\u52a0\u8f7d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u53cd\u6f14\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PFC3D\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u542b\u6c34\u7387\uff085%-15%\uff09\u5bf9\u9ad8\u539f\u51b0\u51bb\u7802\u5ca9\u7684\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u53d8\u5f62-\u7834\u88c2\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u8026\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u51bb\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8106\u6027\uff0c\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u589e\u52a063.15%\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u5438\u6536\u589e\u91cf\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5e38\u6e29\u6837\u54c1\u3002PFC3D\u6a21\u62df\u9610\u91ca\u4e86\u971c\u51bb\u81a8\u80c0\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u6c34\u51b0\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u5ca9\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u539f\u51b0\u51bb\u7802\u5ca9\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u6e29\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8106\u6027\uff0c\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u5438\u6536\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u539f\u5730\u533a\u77ff\u4ea7\u5f00\u91c7\u7684\u7206\u7834\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u65bd\u5de5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The proposed solution addresses common limitations of traditional certification models, such as susceptibility to forgery, reliance on centralized infrastructures, and inefficient verification processes. The system is built on the TRON blockchain and integrates smart contracts written in Solidity, a decentralized web application (dApp) for user interaction, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage of certificate metadata. The methodology comprised architectural design, smart contract development, and the implementation of a web-based interface, followed by functional, security, performance, and usability evaluations. Experimental results show that the system correctly supports certificate issuance and public verification, enforces access control, and resists common misuse scenarios. Performance analysis indicates low confirmation latency and negligible transaction costs, making the solution suitable for large-scale academic environments. Additionally, usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS) resulted in a score of 76.67, indicating good user acceptance. Overall, the results demonstrate the technical feasibility and practical viability of the proposed approach, highlighting the TRON blockchain as an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure for decentralized academic certification systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link.

Provenance-graph analysis has become a prominent approach for APT detection. However, its practical deployment is hampered by (i) the scarcity of APT samples, (ii) the cost and difficulty of fine-grained APT sample labeling, and (iii) the diversity of attack tactics and techniques. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposes APT-MCL, an intelligent APT detection system based on Multi-view Collaborative provenance graph Learning. It adopts an unsupervised learning strategy to discover APT attacks at the node level via anomaly detection. After that, it creates multiple anomaly detection sub-models based on multi-view features and integrates them within a collaborative learning framework to adapt to diverse attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world APT datasets validate the approach: (i) multi-view features improve cross-scenario generalization, and (ii) co-training substantially boosts node-level detection under label scarcity, enabling practical deployment on diverse attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAPT-MCL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9APT\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4ee5\u53ca\u653b\u51fb\u624b\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u771f\u5b9eAPT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "APT-MCL\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u653b\u51fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684APT\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods.

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection.

In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u8fde\u4e58\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u727a\u7272\u5c11\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u5e45\u5b58\u50a8\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd0\u7b97\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u5230\u201c\u62d6\u5c3e\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u6700\u6162\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\u51b3\u5b9a\u6574\u4f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u77e9\u9635\u76f8\u4e58\uff0c\u867d\u7f13\u89e3\u62d6\u5c3e\uff0c\u5374\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u9762\u4e34\u957f\u94fe\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u653e\u5927\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8fde\u4e58\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u662f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u964d\u7ef4\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u6d41\u5f62\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u91cf\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff08RF\uff09\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRF\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff08RF\uff09\u4e3a\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u826f\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u53ca\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.", "AI": {"tldr": "LRC\u5728\u591a\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728BEC/BSC\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u53ea\u9700\u8f7b\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u53ef\u8d8b\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6700\u574f\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u968f\u673a\u901a\u9053\u8868\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136LRC\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u8bef\u7801\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u53d8\u52a8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236LRC\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u64e6\u9664\u901a\u9053\uff08BEC\uff09\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5bf9\u79f0\u901a\u9053\uff08BSC\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u591a\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u89e3\u7801\uff08MLD\uff09\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff08BER\uff09\u548c\u5757\u8bef\u7801\u7387\uff08BLER\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6d53\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u4e0bBER\u4e0eBLER \u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u589e\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5757\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u968f\u5757\u957f\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e14MLD\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6240\u6709\u4e0e\u5757\u957f\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bef\u7801/\u64e6\u9664\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8f7b\u5fae\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ebf\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7801\uff08LRC\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5757\u957f\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5176\u5757\u89e3\u7801\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u8d8b\u4e8e\u96f6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u6821\u9a8c\u4e0b\u7684\u826f\u597d\u533a\u5206\u3002"}}

However, the reliability of these detectors remains fragile against adversarial evasions. Existing attack strategies often rely on white-box assumptions or demand prohibitively high computational and interaction costs, rendering them ineffective under practical black-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose Multi-stage Alignment for Style Humanization (MASH), a novel framework that evades black-box detectors based on style transfer. MASH sequentially employs style-injection supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and inference-time refinement to shape the distributions of AI-generated texts to resemble those of human-written texts. Experiments across 6 datasets and 5 detectors demonstrate the superior performance of MASH over 11 baseline evaders.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information.

Each user reports an automatic random alteration of their true value to the analytics server, which then estimates the histogram of the true unseen values of all users using a debiasing rule to compensate for the added randomness. A known issue is that the standard debiasing rule can yield a vector with negative values (which can not be interpreted as a histogram), and there is no consensus on the best fix.

While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \\times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control.

Therefore, the training's outcome - the DNN weights - represents a significant intellectual property asset to protect. Side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently appeared as an effective approach to recover this confidential asset from DNN implementations. In response, researchers have proposed to defend DNN implementations through classic side-channel countermeasures, at the cost of higher energy consumption, inference time, and resource utilisation. Following a different approach, Ding et al. (HOST'25) introduced MACPRUNING, a novel SCA countermeasure based on pruning, a performance-oriented Approximate Computing technique: at inference time, the implementation randomly prunes (or skips) non-important weights (i.e., with low contribution to the DNN's accuracy) of the first layer, exponentially increasing the side-channel resilience of the protected DNN implementation. However, the original security analysis of MACPRUNING did not consider a control-flow dependency intrinsic to the countermeasure design. This dependency may allow an attacker to circumvent MACPRUNING and recover the weights important to the DNN's accuracy. This paper describes a preprocessing methodology to exploit the above-mentioned control-flow dependency. Through practical experiments on a Chipwhisperer-Lite running a MACPRUNING-protected Multi-Layer Perceptron, we target the first 8 weights of each neuron and recover 96% of the important weights, demonstrating the drastic reduction in security of the protected implementation. Moreover, we show how microarchitectural leakage improves the effectiveness of our methodology, even allowing for the recovery of up to 100% of the targeted non-important weights.

However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa LVICL\uff0c\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08LVICL\uff09\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5411\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u53d6\u793a\u4f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u65f6\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u8be5\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6fc0\u53d1\u51bb\u7ed3 LLM \u7684\u5185\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684 ICL\uff0cLVICL \u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5411\u91cf\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LVICL \u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684 LLM \u6ce8\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9 LLM4TSF \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules.

Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability.

We first perform a fuzzing campaign and show that many mainstream processors (X86/Arm/Apple CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD/Apple GPUs) are susceptible to cross-process signals. We then show how the vulnerability can be used to implement classic attacks, including a covert channel, achieving up to 16 bits/second with 95% accuracy on an Apple M3 GPU, and application fingerprinting, achieving reliable closed-world DNN architecture fingerprinting on several CPUs and an Apple M3 GPU. Finally, we explore how low-level system details can be exploited to increase re-orderings, showing the potential for a covert channel to achieve nearly 30K bits/second on X86 CPUs.

The efficiency of roll-to-roll slot die coating depends on the precise control of various input parameters such as pump rate, substrate velocity and coating gap. However, these inputs are sensitive to disturbances in process conditions, leading to inconsistencies in the various characteristics of the produced film. To address this challenge, a \\gls{DO} is utilized for detecting disturbances, which may occur in the same or different channels as the control signal within the system. A generalized compensator is then implemented to mitigate the impact of these disturbances on the output, thereby enhancing uncertainty suppression. Additionally, integrating the disturbance rejection system with an output tracking controller enables the coating system to maintain the desired thickness under varying input conditions and disturbances. The effectiveness of this approach is then validated using a test rig equipped with a camera system, which facilitates the development of a data-driven model of the dynamic process, represented by state-space equations.

This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \\ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\\times$ less communication.

In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a \"Knowledge-Preservation Plugin\", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference.

However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions.

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RFM \u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u63a8\u7406\u53ca Stein \u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0/\u68af\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf RL \u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u53ca\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u662f\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u662f\u672a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684 Boltzmann \u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ec5\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7 Q \u51fd\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u9006\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Reverse Flow Matching\uff0cRFM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165 Langevin Stein \u64cd\u4f5c\u6784\u9020\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u7c7b\u901a\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u539f\u5148\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u671f\u671b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u65e2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528 Q \u503c\u4e0e Q \u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528 RFM \u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u653f\u7b56\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RFM \u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e2\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u76ee\u6807 Boltzmann \u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf RL \u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting.

Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \\texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines.

In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present.

Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts.

However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures.

Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models.

To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures.

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model.

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns.

This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u8239\u53ea\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u4ece\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8239\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u900f\u8fc7\u8239\u53ea\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d77\u6d0b\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u9700\u76d1\u6d4b\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u624b\u5de5\u5206\u6790\u6d77\u91cf\u5f55\u97f3\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8239\u53ea\u58f0\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6291\u5236\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u5f55\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u8239\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8239\u53ea\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u8239\u53ea\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548UATR\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset.

Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics.

While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns.

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\u66ff\u4ee3\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece54%\u63d0\u5347\u81f383.5%\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u964d\u7ef4\u540e\u7684MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a(QBM)\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a(CBM)\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u8bc4\u4f30QBM\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u8bc4\u4f30CBM\u3002", "result": "QBM\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738783.5%\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCBM\u768454%\uff1bQBM\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u71b5\u66f4\u4f4e\uff081.27 vs 1.39\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u3001\u66f4\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones.

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728k\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u901f\u7387f(k)=k/(k+1)\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfNLHF\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8d28\u4e14\u51b2\u7a81\u504f\u597d\u65f6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49(k,f(k))-\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0eU-\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a(k+1)-\u73a9\u5bb6\u5bf9\u79f0\u9f50\u5e73\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u5229\u7528Nash\u5747\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u610fk\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0e\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u4e2d\u7684\u80dc\u7387\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u65cf\uff0c\u5176k\u6837\u672c\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0U-\u5bf9\u9f50\u901f\u7387f(k)=k/(k+1)\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u73b0\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u5927k\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6k/(k+1)\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}
