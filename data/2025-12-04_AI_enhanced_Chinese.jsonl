Among the transmission technologies operating in unlicensed bands available to this purpose, Wi-Fi is certainly one of the most interesting, because of its high performance and the relatively low deployment costs. Unfortunately, its dependability is often deemed unsuitable for real-time control systems. In this paper, the use of parallel redundancy is evaluated from a quantitative viewpoint, by considering a number of performance indices that are relevant for soft real-time applications. Analysis is carried out on a large dataset acquired from a real setup, to provide realistic insights on the advantages this kind of approaches can provide. As will be seen, deferred parallel redundancy provides clear advantages in terms of the worst-case transmission latency, at limited costs concerning the amount of consumed spectrum. Hence, it can be practically exploited every time a wireless connection is included in a control loop.", "AI": {"tldr": "Deferred parallel redundancy improves worst-case latency in Wi-Fi-based industrial control with modest spectrum cost, as shown by real-world data.", "motivation": "Industrial wireless links must be dependable with low latency for soft real-time control; while Wi-Fi offers high performance, reliability concerns limit its use in control loops.", "method": "Quantitative evaluation using a large real-world dataset, comparing parallel redundancy schemes and focusing on deferred redundancy.", "result": "Deferred parallel redundancy reduces worst-case transmission latency with limited spectrum overhead, enabling practical use in control loops.", "conclusion": "Parallel redundancy, especially deferred redundancy, can make Wi-Fi viable for soft real-time industrial control."}}

However, classical RL suffers from limitations in generalization, learning feedback, interpretability, and sample efficiency in dynamic wireless environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm with exceptional capabilities in knowledge generalization, contextual reasoning, and interactive generation, which have demonstrated strong potential to enhance classical RL. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize the roles of LLMs into four critical functions: state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. Then, we review existing studies exploring how each role of LLMs enhances different stages of the RL pipeline. Moreover, we provide a series of case studies to illustrate how to design and apply LLM-enhanced RL in low-altitude economy networking, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground integrated networks. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for LLM-enhanced RL and offer insights into its future development in wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks: a taxonomy of four roles (state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, generator) to augment RL, a survey of existing studies, case studies across low-altitude economy networks, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground networks, and future directions.", "motivation": "Address RL limitations in generalization, sample efficiency, interpretability, and learning feedback in dynamic wireless environments by leveraging LLMs' knowledge, reasoning, and contextual generation.", "method": "Propose a taxonomy of four LLM roles, review existing work mapping these roles to stages of the RL pipeline, and present case studies across diverse wireless network settings to illustrate design and deployment.", "result": "A comprehensive tutorial that structures how LLMs can augment RL in wireless networks, offering a practical framework and illustrative case studies to guide future research and applications.", "conclusion": "LLM-enhanced RL is a promising direction for wireless networks, with potential to improve generalization, adaptability, and efficiency; future work should address integration challenges, evaluation methodologies, and domain-specific considerations."}}

In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects.

Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings. On the other hand, the proposed CFO-aware detector delivers improved robustness under severe CFO conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u745e\u5229\u8870\u843d\u4e0b\u7684PRACH\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387-\u65f6\u5ef6\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u529f\u7387\u53e0\u52a0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u9608\u503c\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u691c\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eCFO\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u529f\u7387\u53e0\u52a0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e25\u91cdCFO\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "5G/6G\u521d\u59cb\u63a5\u5165\u5bf9PRACH\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u4e0d\u540c\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u548cCFO\u7b49\u7efc\u5408 impairments \u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u745e\u5229\u8870\u843d\u4e0b\u7684\u63a5\u6536 PDP \u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9608\u503c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u95ed\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u7c7b\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u95f4\u60c5\u5f62\uff08\u91cd\u590d\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u540c/\u72ec\u7acb\uff09\uff1b\u5229\u7528CFO\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684PDP\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0eCFO\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9608\u503c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u76f8\u5e72\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u91cd\u590d\u95f4\u4fe1\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u529f\u7387\u53e0\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CFO\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5f3aCFO\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548cCFO\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u63d0\u5347PRACH\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CFO-aware\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 \u00b0C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 \u00b0C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u7684ML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u94a2\u94c1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u51b7\u5374\u8f6c\u5316\uff08CCT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684CCT\u56fe\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8f6c\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684ML\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u6750\u6599\u5982\u94a2\u94c1\u7684\u666e\u9002ML\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u5316\u5b66\u6210\u5206\u3001\u52a0\u5de5\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u7684ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u6d1e\u89c1\u4e0eML\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u51b7\u5374\u8f6c\u5316\uff08CCT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4ee5\u5305\u542b4,100\u4e2aCCT\u56fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u8c03\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u91d1\u94a2\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684100\u6761\u51b7\u5374\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684CCT\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684CCT\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff08100\u6761\u51b7\u5374\u66f2\u7ebf\u57285\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff09\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u5747\u8d85\u8fc788%\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u7684MAE\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e20\u00b0C\uff0c\u552f\u72ec\u8d1d\u6c0f\u4f53\u7684MAE\u7a0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3a27\u00b0C\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5408\u91d1\u94a2\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ML\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u53ca\u5b9a\u5411\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u652f\u6301\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

A novel PASS-based multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework is proposed by exploiting the waveguide-division (WD) transmission characteristic. Specifically, each NOMA user cluster is served by one dedicated waveguide, and the corresponding pinching beamforming is exploited to enhance the intra-cluster performance while mitigating the inter-cluster interference. Based on this framework, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing power allocation, pinching beamforming, and user scheduling. To solve this problem, a two-step algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems. For the joint power allocation and pinching beamforming design, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm is proposed to obtain the locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the coupling constraints are alleviated through augmented Lagrangian relaxation, and the resulting augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem is decomposed into four subproblems, which are solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. For the user scheduling, a low-complexity matching algorithm is developed to solve the user-to-waveguide assignment problem. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-based NOMA framework under the WD transmission structure achieves significant sum-rate gain over conventional fixed-position antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; and 2) the proposed matching-based user scheduling algorithm achieves near-optimal user-waveguide association with low computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePinching-antenna\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PASS\uff09\u7684WD\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0b\u591a\u7528\u6237NOMA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5e76\u5229\u7528pinching\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u63d0\u5347\u7c07\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6291\u5236\u7c07\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u5165\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9PASS\u5728WD\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684NOMA\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2aNOMA\u7528\u6237\u7c07\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u6ce2\u5bfc\u627f\u8f7d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528pinching\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u63d0\u5347\u7c07\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6291\u5236\u7c07\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u5c06\u603b\u548c\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3001pinching\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e09\u5927\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6b65\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u7528\u60e9\u7f5a\u5bf9\u5076\u5206\u89e3(PDD)\u6c42\u89e3\u8054\u5408\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548cpinching\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u589e\u5e7f\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u677e\u5f1b\u5e76\u5c06AL\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a4\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528BCD\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u6ce2\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8ePASS\u7684WD\u4f20\u8f93\u7ed3\u6784\u7684NOMA\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\u4e0eOMA\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7528\u6237-\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8ePASS\u7684WD\u4f20\u8f93NOMA\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7PDD-BCD\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks from misaligned systems that subvert other control efforts, for instance, by disabling automated monitors or self-exfiltrating to external data centres. PAS protocols supplement other safety efforts, such as alignment fine-tuning or monitoring, contributing to defence-in-depth against AI risk. We provide a concrete demonstration in SHADE-Arena, a benchmark for AI monitoring and subversion capabilities, in which PAS protocols supplement monitoring to increase safety with little cost to performance. Next, PAS protocols should be robust to malicious actors who want to bypass shutdown. Therefore, we conduct a red-team blue-team game between the developers (blue-team), who must implement a robust PAS protocol, and a red-team trying to subvert the protocol. We conduct experiments in a code-generation setting, finding that there are effective strategies for the red-team, such as using another model to filter inputs, or fine-tuning the model to prevent shutdown behaviour. We then outline key challenges to implementing PAS protocols in real-life systems, including: security considerations of the password and decisions regarding when, and in which systems, to use them. PAS protocols are an intuitive mechanism for increasing the safety of frontier AI. We encourage developers to consider implementing PAS protocols prior to internal deployment of particularly dangerous systems to reduce loss-of-control risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u7801\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u505c\u673a\u534f\u8bae PAS\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 SHADE-Arena \u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u7ea2\u84dd\u961f\u5bf9\u6297\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1 PAS \u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u73af\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ca\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5f15\u5165 PAS \u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u53ef\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u6cbb\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u505c\u673a\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u63a7\u65f6\u8fc5\u901f\u963b\u65ad\u5371\u9669\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\u3002PAS \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9047\u5230\u5bc6\u7801\u89e6\u53d1\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u505c\u673a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5171\u540c\u6784\u7b51\u9632\u5fa1\u94fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa PAS \u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f4\u89c2\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u51fa\u73b0\u5931\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u505c\u673a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 SHADE-Arena \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a PAS \u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u4e92\u8865\u3001\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002\u5f00\u5c55\u7ea2\u84dd\u5bf9\u6297\uff1a\u84dd\u961f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2 PAS\uff0c\u7ea2\u961f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7ed5\u8fc7\uff1b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u624b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5982\u7528\u53e6\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u505c\u673a\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5bc6\u7801\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u4f55\u65f6/\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8868\u660e PAS \u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u88ab\u89c4\u907f\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86 PAS \u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PAS \u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u524d\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u73b0 PAS\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5931\u63a7\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u673a\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, the significant resource requirements of FL often exclude centres with limited computational infrastructure, further widening existing healthcare disparities. To address this issue, we propose a Green AI-oriented adaptive layer-freezing strategy designed to reduce energy consumption and computational load while maintaining model performance. We tested our approach using different federated architectures for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-to-Computed Tomography (CT) conversion. The proposed adaptive strategy optimises the federated training by selectively freezing the encoder weights based on the monitored relative difference of the encoder weights from round to round. A patience-based mechanism ensures that freezing only occurs when updates remain consistently minimal. The energy consumption and CO2eq emissions of the federation were tracked using the CodeCarbon library. Compared to equivalent non-frozen counterparts, our approach reduced training time, total energy consumption and CO2eq emissions by up to 23%. At the same time, the MRI-to-CT conversion performance was maintained, with only small variations in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Notably, for three out of the five evaluated architectures, no statistically significant differences were observed, while two architectures exhibited statistically significant improvements.

Inf. Theory", "summary": "This paper addresses the reconstruction of sparse signals from generalized linear measurements. Signal sparsity is assumed to be sublinear in the signal dimension while it was proportional to the signal dimension in conventional research. Approximate message-passing (AMP) has poor convergence properties for sensing matrices beyond standard Gaussian matrices. To solve this convergence issue, generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP) is proposed for signals with sublinear sparsity. The main feature of GOAMP is the so-called Onsager correction to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors. The Onsager correction in GOAMP is designed via state evolution for orthogonally invariant sensing matrices in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity and measurement dimension tend to infinity at sublinear speed in the signal dimension. When the support of non-zero signals does not contain a neighborhood of the origin, GOAMP using Bayesian denoisers is proved to achieve error-free signal reconstruction for linear measurements if and only if the measurement dimension is larger than a threshold, which is equal to that of AMP for standard Gaussian sensing matrices. Numerical simulations are also presented for linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. When ill-conditioned sensing matrices are used, GOAMP for sublinear sparsity is shown to outperform existing reconstruction algorithms, including generalized AMP for sublinear sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOAMP \u9488\u5bf9\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 AMP \u6536\u655b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Onsager \u4fee\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\u6e10\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e0d\u53d8\u77e9\u9635\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65e0\u8bef\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e 1-bit CS \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf AMP \u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6216\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u77e9\u9635\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e9f\u9700\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Onsager \u4fee\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\uff1b\u5728 sublinear sparsity \u7684\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1 Onsager \u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c 1-bit CS \u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u652f\u96c6\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u539f\u70b9\u90bb\u57df\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8bef\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u75c5\u6001/\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u4e0b\uff0cGOAMP \u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684 Sublinear AMP\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u82e5\u975e\u96f6\u652f\u96c6\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u539f\u70b9\u90bb\u57df\u4e14\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5219 GOAMP \u5b9e\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\u65e0\u635f\u91cd\u6784\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e 1-bit CS\uff09\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e0d\u53d8\u77e9\u9635\u53ca\u75c5\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cGOAMP \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf AMP \u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GOAMP \u5c06 AMP \u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b50\u7ebf\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e0d\u53d8\u77e9\u9635\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdDoppler\u9c81\u68d2\u7684ISAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u611f\u77e5\u540e\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CDMM\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u6da1\u65cb\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u7528VCM-EM\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684Doppler\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684CSI\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e0e\u6ce2\u675f\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u5206\u6790 pilots \u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5bf9\u51c6\u4e0e\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e sensing \u4e0e communication \u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u654f\u611f\u7684OAM\u6da1\u65cb\u6ce2\u524d\u3002\u9700\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u6291\u5236Doppler\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7CDMM\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u9001\u591a\u6da1\u65cb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faVCM-EM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u611f\u77e5\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u65b9\u4f4d\u3001\u4fef\u4ef0\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3Doppler\u8bf1\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u901a\u4fe1\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684CSI\u8fdb\u884c\u53d1\u9001\u7aef\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u6ce2\u675f\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u8054\u5408\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30 pilots \u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u4e0e\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cVCM-EM \u4e0eISAC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Doppler\u9c81\u68d2ISAC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236Doppler\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793apilot\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1/\u5bf9\u51c6/\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, these adaptation components are tightly coupled to a specific base model, making them difficult to reuse when the base model is upgraded (e.g., from SD 1.x to 2.x) due to substantial changes in model parameters and architecture. In this work, we propose Delta Sampling (DS), a novel method that enables knowledge transfer across base models with different architectures, without requiring access to the original training data. DS operates entirely at inference time by leveraging the delta: the difference in model predictions before and after the adaptation of a base model. This delta is then used to guide the denoising process of a new base model. We evaluate DS across various SD versions, demonstrating that DS achieves consistent improvements in creating desired effects (e.g., visual styles, semantic concepts, and structures) under different sampling strategies. These results highlight DS as an effective, plug-and-play mechanism for knowledge transfer in diffusion-based image synthesis.

When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e26\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684FIS\u5bf9\u6bd4RIS\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u53cd\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u7684FIS\uff08beyond-diagonal FIS\uff09\u5728\u53d1/\u6536\u6781\u5316\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u53474\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7c7b\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\u4e0eFIS\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5bf9\u89d2\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u541e\u5410\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbRIS\u4e0eFIS\u7684\u4fe1\u9053/\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u89d2\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u53cd\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u5728\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982SNR/\u901f\u7387\uff09\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u53d1/\u6536\u6781\u5316\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u540c\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e26\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684FIS\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8eRIS\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u83b7\u5f974\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u5f53\u4f20\u8f93\u7aef\u548c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u6781\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0cbeyond-diagonal FIS\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0cFIS\u5728\u53cc\u6781\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4RIS\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u53cd\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\uff08beyond-diagonal\uff09\u5728\u6781\u5316\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u91cd\u89c6FIS\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u53cd\u5c04\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However finding new sources of such data is getting harder: most publicly-available human generated data will soon have been used. Additionally, publicly available data often is not representative of users of a particular system -- for example, a research speech dataset of contractors interacting with an AI assistant will likely be more homogeneous, well articulated and self-censored than real world commands that end users will issue. Therefore unlocking high-quality data grounded in real user interactions is of vital interest. However, the direct use of user data comes with significant privacy risks. Differential Privacy (DP) is a well established framework for reasoning about and limiting information leakage, and is a gold standard for protecting user privacy. The focus of this work, \\emph{Differentially Private Synthetic data}, refers to synthetic data that preserves the overall trends of source data,, while providing strong privacy guarantees to individuals that contributed to the source dataset. DP synthetic data can unlock the value of datasets that have previously been inaccessible due to privacy concerns and can replace the use of sensitive datasets that previously have only had rudimentary protections like ad-hoc rule-based anonymization.\n  In this paper we explore the full suite of techniques surrounding DP synthetic data, the types of privacy protections they offer and the state-of-the-art for various modalities (image, tabular, text and decentralized). We outline all the components needed in a system that generates DP synthetic data, from sensitive data handling and preparation, to tracking the use and empirical privacy testing. We hope that work will result in increased adoption of DP synthetic data, spur additional research and increase trust in DP synthetic data approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u539f\u7406\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u8868\u683c\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7b49\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u91ca\u653e\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5168\u8c31\u7cfb\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u68b3\u7406\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u8868\u683c\u3001\u6587\u672c\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7b49\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u73b0\u6709DP\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u7aef\u5230\u7aefDP\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u52a8DP\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9DP\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The proposed control method can effectively suppress swing and achieve precise positioning. Firstly, by enhancing the coupling relationship between the trolley displacement and swing angle, a composite signal with an error term was designed. Then, an energy-based Lyapunov function was constructed using the composite error signal, which incorporated a new formulation of the inertia matrix and potential energy function. Subsequently, using the backstepping method in conjunction with the hyperbolic tangent function, a controller with partial performance constraints was designed. In addition, to further enhance the system's dynamic performance, a fuzzy control scheme with online adjustable system parameters was designed. Finally, the stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory combined with LaSalle's invariance principle. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits superior performance and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5e26\u53cc\u6446\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6865\u5f0f\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u626d\u77e9\u6296\u52a8\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6291\u632f\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u7efc\u5408\u80cc\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u80fd\u91cfLyapunov\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u8c03\u6a21\u7cca\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6865\u5f0f\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u6446\u89d2\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u626d\u77e9\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u6446\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u96be\u70b9\u3002\u9700\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u8026\u5408\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0e\u6446\u89d2\u7684\u590d\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u91cfLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u60ef\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0e\u52bf\u80fd\u9879\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5728\u56de\u9000\u63a7\u5236\uff08backstepping\uff09\u4e0e\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528Lyapunov\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408LaSalle\u4e0d\u53d8\u96c6\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5168\u5c40\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u626d\u77e9\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6446\u632f\u6291\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u5e26\u53cc\u6446\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6865\u5f0f\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u626d\u77e9\u6296\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, optimizing EB charging schedules to minimize operational costs while ensuring safe operation without battery depletion remains challenging - especially under real-world conditions, where uncertainties in PV generation, dynamic electricity prices, variable travel times, and limited charging infrastructure must be accounted for. In this paper, we propose a safe Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) framework for solving the EB Charging Scheduling Problem (EBCSP) under multi-source uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with options to enable temporally abstract decision-making. We develop a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Lagrangian (DAC-MAPPO-Lagrangian), which integrates Lagrangian relaxation into the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) framework.

Graphical threat models are a recommended tool to analyze and communicate threat information. However, the comparison of different graphical threat models, and the acceptability of these threat models for an audience with a limited technical background, is not well understood, despite these users making up a sizable portion of the cybersecurity industry. We seek to compare the acceptability of three general, graphical threat models, Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs), Attack Graphs (AGs), and CORAS, for users with a limited technical background. We conducted a laboratory study with 38 bachelor students who completed tasks with the three threat models across three different scenarios assigned using a Latin square design. Threat model submissions were qualitatively analyzed, and participants filled out a perception questionnaire based on the Method Evaluation Model (MEM). We find that both ADTs and CORAS are broadly acceptable for a wide range of scenarios, and both could be applied successfully by users with a limited technical background; further, we also find that the lack of a specific tool for AGs may have impacted the perceived usefulness of AGs. We can recommend that users with a limited technical background use ADTs or CORAS as a general graphical TM method.

Our design leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and Analytic Quantum Gradient Descent (AQGD) to secure data preparation, model sharing, and training stages.

To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa CaFTRA \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684 CSI \u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u5757\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548 6G \u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u9988\u74f6\u9888\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u652f\u6491 AI-native 6G \u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528 Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network \u9884\u6d4b\u9891\u57df CSI\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u591a\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9-\u591a RB \u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e5G\u3002", "conclusion": "CaFTRA \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u4f20\u8f93+AI \u539f\u751f 6G \u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002"}}

However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684MitM\u653b\u51fb\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684DiR\u518d\u7f16\u7801\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684TTA-LM\u65f6\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6f5c\u5728 manip\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u89e3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49 latent \u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u64cd\u63a7\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "method": "1) DiR\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e0eSemCom\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u30022) TTA-LM\uff1a\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1/\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u62e6\u622a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5230\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6307\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u90fd\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u89e3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684SemCom\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6548\u529b\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ca\u4e24\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9SemCom\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u5f00\u5c55\u9632\u62a4\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a fixed-initial-state constant-input dynamical system (FISCIDS) representation, which provides an exact and parametric model for a broad class of nonlinear functions. A FISCIDS representation of a given nonlinear function consists of an input-affine dynamical system with a fixed initial state and constant input. The argument of the function is applied as the constant input to the input-affine system, and the value of the function is the output of the input-affine system at a fixed terminal time.

Within this landscape, mixed-data clustering has become a critical challenge, requiring innovative methods that can effectively exploit heterogeneous data types, including numerical and categorical variables. Traditional clustering techniques, typically designed for homogeneous datasets, often struggle to capture the additional complexity introduced by mixed data, underscoring the need for approaches specifically tailored to this setting. Hierarchical and explainable algorithms are particularly valuable in this context, as they provide structured, interpretable clustering results that support informed decision-making.

There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy\" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u7387\u5931\u771f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u5bf9\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5931\u771f\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\uff09\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f8b\u5b50\u8bc1\u660e\u754c\u9650\u7684\u7d27\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u62bd\u8c61\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u9650\u62bd\u8c61\u5728\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u201c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u201d\u4e0b\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u968f\u7ef4\u6570\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u7ef4\u6570\u707e\u96be\u201d\u3002\u5c1a\u65e0\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6743\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u5957\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u89c6\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7801\u7387\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u5931\u771f\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7387\u5931\u771f\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u5c3a\u5bf8\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5931\u771f\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u4e0b\u754c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u754c\u9650\u7684\u7d27\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u9020\u5728\u5c3a\u5bf8-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5931\u771f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8be5\u4e0b\u754c\u8fbe\u5230\u7d27\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5c3a\u5bf8-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c06\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u62bd\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, their application raises significant fairness concerns, as GNNs can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases against protected groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. These biases are often inherent in the node features, structural topology, and message-passing mechanisms of the graph itself. A critical limitation of existing fairness-aware GNN methods is their reliance on the strong assumption that sensitive attributes are fully available for all nodes during training--a condition that poses a practical impediment due to privacy concerns and data collection constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel, model-agnostic fairness regularization framework designed for the realistic scenario where sensitive attributes are only partially available. Our approach formalizes a fairness-aware objective function that integrates both equal opportunity and statistical parity as differentiable regularization terms. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates bias across key fairness metrics while maintaining competitive node classification performance. Results show that our framework consistently outperforms baseline models in achieving a favorable fairness-accuracy trade-off, with minimal degradation in predictive accuracy.

In this work, our aim is to interpret its structure for Flow Matching (FM). FM learns a velocity field that transports samples from a simple source distribution to data by integrating an ODE. In rectified FM, training pairs are obtained by linearly interpolating between a source sample and a data sample, and a neural velocity field is trained to predict the straight line displacement using a mean squared error loss. This squared loss collapses all velocity targets that reach the same space-time point into a single conditional mean, thereby ignoring higher order conditional information (variance, skewness, multi-modality) that encodes fine geometric structure about the data manifold and minority branches. We apply the standard risk-sensitive (log-exponential) transform to the conditional FM loss and show that the resulting tilted risk loss is a natural upper-bound on a meaningful conditional entropic FM objective defined at each space-time point. Furthermore, we show that a small order expansion of the gradient of this conditional entropic objective yields two interpretable first order corrections: covariance preconditioning of the FM residual, and a skew tail term that favors asymmetric or rare branches. On synthetic data designed to probe ambiguity and tails, the resulting risk-sensitive loss improves statistical metrics and recovers geometric structure more faithfully than standard rectified FM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u573a\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\u635f\u5931\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u6307\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u7684 tilted \u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u6761\u4e00\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u504f\u5c3e\u9879\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6 FM\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u77e9\u5f62\u5316 FM \u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u5ffd\u7565\u9ad8\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u504f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u5cf0\u6027\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u628a\u63e1\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u601d\u60f3\u5f15\u5165 FM \u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7a00\u6709/\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6 FM \u635f\u5931\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u6307\u6570\u53d8\u6362\uff08tilted \u98ce\u9669\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u5f0f FM \u76ee\u6807\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c0f\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e24\u6761\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\uff1aFM \u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u504f\u5c3e\u9879\uff0c\u504f\u5411\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6216\u7a00\u6709\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u4e0e\u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u635f\u5931\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u77e9\u5f62\u5316 FM\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u6570\u6307\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u5f15\u5165 FM \u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5c3e\u90e8\u548c\u7a00\u6709\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members.

We propose ECLIPSE, a framework that treats hallucination as a mismatch between a model's semantic entropy and the capacity of available evidence. We combine entropy estimation via multi-sample clustering with a novel perplexity decomposition that measures how models use retrieved evidence. We prove that under mild conditions, the resulting entropy-capacity objective is strictly convex with a unique stable optimum. We evaluate on a controlled financial question answering dataset with GPT-3.5-turbo (n=200 balanced samples with synthetic hallucinations), where ECLIPSE achieves ROC AUC of 0.89 and average precision of 0.90, substantially outperforming a semantic entropy-only baseline (AUC 0.50). A controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku, which lacks token-level log probabilities, shows AUC dropping to 0.59 with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 95% - demonstrating that ECLIPSE is a logprob-native mechanism whose effectiveness depends on calibrated token-level uncertainties. The perplexity decomposition features exhibit the largest learned coefficients, confirming that evidence utilization is central to hallucination detection.

While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol.

However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

First, the canonical Shapley framework assumes that the worth function is additive, yet real-world payoff constructions--driven by non-Gaussian distributions, heavy tails, feature dependence, or domain-specific loss scales--often violate this assumption, leading to distorted attributions. Secondly, achieving sparse explanations in high dimensions by computing dense Shapley values and then applying ad hoc thresholding is prohibitively costly and risks inconsistency. We introduce Sparse Isotonic Shapley Regression (SISR), a unified nonlinear explanation framework. SISR simultaneously learns a monotonic transformation to restore additivity--obviating the need for a closed-form specification--and enforces an L0 sparsity constraint on the Shapley vector, enhancing computational efficiency in large feature spaces. Its optimization algorithm leverages Pool-Adjacent-Violators for efficient isotonic regression and normalized hard-thresholding for support selection, yielding implementation ease and global convergence guarantees. Analysis shows that SISR recovers the true transformation in a wide range of scenarios and achieves strong support recovery even in high noise. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate that irrelevant features and inter-feature dependencies can induce a true payoff transformation that deviates substantially from linearity. Experiments in regression, logistic regression, and tree ensembles demonstrate that SISR stabilizes attributions across payoff schemes, correctly filters irrelevant features while standard Shapley values suffer severe rank and sign distortions. By unifying nonlinear transformation estimation with sparsity pursuit, SISR advances the frontier of nonlinear explainability, providing a theoretically grounded and practical attribution framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "SISR \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u548c L0 \u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7684 Shapley \u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 PAV \u7b49\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "Shapley \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684 payoff \u5e38\u975e\u52a0\u6027\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6216\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9 Shapley \u5411\u91cf\u65bd\u52a0 L0 \u7a00\u758f\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7 Pool-Adjacent-Violators (PAV) \u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u5355\u8c03\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u786c\u9608\u503c\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4 payoff \u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSISR \u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c payoff \u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b5b\u9009\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6807\u51c6 Shapley \u7684\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u5931\u771f\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u5171\u540c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u624e\u5b9e\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff0cSISR \u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8 payoff \u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027 explainability \u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u91ca\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them.

However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses.

Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN) \u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u534f\u8bae R-HTLC\uff0c\u7528\u5c0f\u65f6\u6c99\u6f0f\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u9000\u6b3e\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8df3\u8de8\u94fe\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7ed3\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u534f\u8c03\u4fdd\u969c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u94fe\u63a5\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u94fe\u591a\u8df3\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u79bb\u7ebf\u8282\u70b9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CCN \u53ca R-HTLC\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5c0f\u65f6\u6c99\u6f0f\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u9000\u6b3e\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u94fe\u4e0b\u534f\u8c03\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u79bb\u7ebf\u65f6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7ed3\u7b97\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u7c7b\u79bb\u7ebf\u5931\u8d25\uff1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u79bb\u7ebf\uff1bR-HTLC \u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e9b\u8282\u70b9\u79bb\u7ebf\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u7b97\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u9762\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0e\u94fe\u4e0b\u534f\u8c03\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53ef\u94fe\u63a5\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CCN \u4e0e R-HTLC \u4e3a\u591a\u8df3\u8de8\u94fe\u4ea4\u6613\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206\u8282\u70b9\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e5f\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their ability to continually learn new tasks is severely hindered by catastrophic forgetting, both within a modality (intra-modal) and across modalities (inter-modal). While intra-modal forgetting has been studied in prior continual learning (CL) work, inter-modal forgetting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify and empirically validate this phenomenon in UMGMs and provide a theoretical explanation rooted in gradient conflict between modalities. To address both intra- and inter-modal forgetting, we propose Modality-Decoupled Experts (MoDE), a lightweight and scalable architecture that isolates modality-specific updates to mitigate the gradient conflict and leverages knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting and preserve pre-trained capabilities. Unlike previous CL methods that remain modality-coupled and suffer from modality gradient conflict, MoDE explicitly decouples modalities to prevent interference. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoDE significantly mitigates both inter- and intra-modal forgetting, outperforming prior CL baselines in unified multimodal generation settings.

Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products.

However, this approach faces significant computational challenges stemming from high sequencing noise, low viral coverage, fragmented reads, and the complete absence of labeled variant annotations. Traditional reference-based variant calling pipelines struggle with novel mutations and require extensive computational resources. We present a comprehensive framework for unsupervised viral variant detection using Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) that learns discrete codebooks of genomic patterns from k-mer tokenized sequences without requiring reference genomes or variant labels. Our approach extends the base VQ-VAE architecture with masked reconstruction pretraining for robustness to missing data and contrastive learning for highly discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing data comprising approximately 100,000 reads, our VQ-VAE achieves 99.52% mean token-level accuracy and 56.33% exact sequence match rate while maintaining 19.73% codebook utilization (101 of 512 codes active), demonstrating efficient discrete representation learning. Contrastive fine-tuning with different projection dimensions yields substantial clustering improvements: 64-dimensional embeddings achieve +35% Silhouette score improvement (0.31 to 0.42), while 128-dimensional embeddings achieve +42% improvement (0.31 to 0.44), clearly demonstrating the impact of embedding dimensionality on variant discrimination capability. Our reference-free framework provides a scalable, interpretable approach to genomic surveillance with direct applications to public health monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA) \u53ef\u9006\u8f6c finetuning-based unlearning \u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM) \u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a DiMRA \u80fd\u9006\u8f6c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c DiMUM \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9 DiMRA \u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u6d89\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u201c\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u62b9\u53bb\u201d\uff08unlearning\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684 unlearning \u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6216\u9488\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u522b/\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5 finetuning \u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u88ab\u53cd\u5411\u653b\u51fb\u53cd\u590d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DiMRA\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u4e8b\u5148\u77e5\u6653\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u9006\u5411\u8fd8\u539f\u66fe\u7ecf\u88ab\u6e05\u9664\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa DiMUM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u672a\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362\u76ee\u6807\u672a\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6216\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u5907\u9009\uff0c\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiMRA \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9006\u8f6c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e finetuning \u7684\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u62b9\u53bb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002DiMUM \u5219\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9 DiMRA \u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684 finetuning-based unlearning \u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002DiMUM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u672a\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e2\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u5c3d\u91cf\u51cf\u5c0f\u5bf9\u539f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9006\u5411\u9057\u5fd8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u5e76\u5b8c\u5584\u76f8\u5173\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

In the meantime, they do not give the user any hints as to whether their reasoning is on the right track, and do not give the user any recourse to stop and correct them if their reasoning is flawed. This creates a frustrating, but unfortunately common, experience: the user's time is wasted while the model reasons from a false premise that could have easily been corrected. In contrast, human speakers typically perform lightweight, incremental grounding acts to ensure that participants in the conversation are on the same page; here we ask if language models can learn to leverage a similar type of behavior? With this motivation, we propose interleaved reasoning (IR), in which the model alternates between thinking and surfacing intermediate responses, as an alternative to the standard \"think-then-answer\" approach. By providing useful information to the user earlier, IR reduces perceived latency, the time a user waits for an initial output, without compromising the quality of the final response. We further introduce a specialization of interleaved reasoning, Plantain (Plan-Thought-Answer Interleaving), where the first intermediate response is an explicit, step-by-step plan for executing the task. This plan-first strategy allows for user intervention and early feedback for subsequent reasoning steps.

Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper.

However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training.

Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets.

However, many VLMs exhibit reduced factual recall performance compared to their LLM backbones, raising the question of how effective multimodal fine-tuning is at extending existing mechanisms within the LLM to visual inputs. We argue that factual recall based on visual inputs requires VLMs to solve a two-hop problem: (1) forming entity representations from visual inputs, and (2) recalling associated factual knowledge based on these entity representations. By benchmarking 14 VLMs with various architectures (LLaVA, Native, Cross-Attention), sizes (7B-124B parameters), and training setups on factual recall tasks against their original LLM backbone models, we find that 11 of 14 models exhibit factual recall degradation. We select three models with high and two models with low performance degradation, and use attribution patching, activation patching, and probing to show that degraded VLMs struggle to use the existing factual recall circuit of their LLM backbone, because they resolve the first hop too late in the computation. In contrast, high-performing VLMs resolve entity representations early enough to reuse the existing factual recall mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate two methods to recover performance: patching entity representations from the LLM backbone into the VLM, and prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning. Our results highlight that the speed of early entity resolution critically determines how effective VLMs are in using preexisting LLM mechanisms.

We introduce BlendedNet++, a large-scale aerodynamic dataset and benchmark focused on blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. The dataset contains over 12,000 unique geometries, each simulated at a single flight condition, yielding 12,490 aerodynamic results for steady RANS CFD. For every case, we provide (i) integrated force/moment coefficients CL, CD, CM and (ii) dense surface fields of pressure and skin friction coefficients Cp and (Cfx, Cfy, Cfz). Using this dataset, we standardize a forward-surrogate benchmark to predict pointwise fields across six model families: GraphSAGE, GraphUNet, PointNet, a coordinate Transformer (Transolver-style), a FiLMNet (coordinate MLP with feature-wise modulation), and a Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT). Finally, we present an inverse design task of achieving a specified lift-to-drag ratio under fixed flight conditions, implemented via a conditional diffusion model. To assess performance, we benchmark this approach against gradient-based optimization on the same surrogate and a diffusion-optimization hybrid that first samples with the conditional diffusion model and then further optimizes the designs. BlendedNet++ provides a unified forward and inverse protocol with multi-model baselines, enabling fair, reproducible comparison across architectures and optimization paradigms. We expect BlendedNet++ to catalyze reproducible research in field-level aerodynamics and inverse design; resources (dataset, splits, baselines, and scripts) will be released upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "BlendedNet++ \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u573a\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6df7\u5408\u7ffc\u8eab\uff08BWB\uff09\u673a\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7ea612,000+ \u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u548c 12,490 \u6761\u7a33\u6001 RANS CFD \u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u79ef\u5206\u529b\u77e9\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8868\u9762\u573a\uff08\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u5b8c\u6210\u70b9\u573a\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u5b9a\u5347\u963b\u6bd4\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\u4ee5\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u524d\u5411/\u53cd\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8d44\u6e90\u5c06\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u573a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9 BWB \u673a\u578b\u7684\u573a\u7ea7\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb BlendedNet++ \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u7ea6 12,000 \u591a\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u98de\u884c\u5de5\u51b5\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa 12,490 \u6761\u7a33\u6001 RANS CFD \u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7efc\u5408\u529b/\u529b\u77e9\u7cfb\u6570(CL, CD, CM)\u53ca\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u573a Cp \u4e0e Cfx, Cfy, Cfz\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u524d\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516d\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\uff1aGraphSAGE\u3001GraphUNet\u3001PointNet\u3001\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u5668 Transolver \u98ce\u683c\u3001FiLMNet\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca Graph Neural Operator Transformer (GNOT)\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347/\u963b\u529b\u6bd4\uff08L/D\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u540c\u7b49 surrogate \u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5148\u91c7\u6837\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6269\u6563-\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u524d\u5411 Surrogate \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516d\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8ba1\u5212\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u5212\u5206\u3001\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "BlendedNet++ \u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u573a\u7ea7\u6c14\u52a8\u5b66\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u524d\u5411/\u53cd\u5411\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8d44\u6e90\u5c06\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\u540e\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u3002"}}

Traditional HAR involves constructing pipelines reliant on centralized user data, which can pose privacy concerns as they necessitate the uploading of user data to a centralized server. This work proposes multi-frequency Federated Learning (FL) to enable: (1) privacy-aware ML; (2) joint ML model learning across devices with varying sampling frequency. We focus on head-worn devices (e.g., earbuds and smart glasses), a relatively unexplored domain compared to traditional smartwatch- or smartphone-based HAR. Results have shown improvements on two datasets against frequency-specific approaches, indicating a promising future in the multi-frequency FL-HAR task.

Across synthetic and real datasets, conformalized forecasters achieve near-nominal coverage with competitive accuracy and generally improved band efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff08ACI/AgACI\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4fdd\u5f62\u5305\u88c5\u5668\u4ee5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u914d\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e26\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u540d\u4e49\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u5747\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684 regime\u5207\u6362\u7ecf\u5e38\u7834\u574f\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08Deep Switching State Space Models\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u5f62\u63a8\u65ad\uff08Adaptive Conformal Inference, ACI\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u805a\u5408\u7248\u672c AgACI \u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4fdd\u5f62\u5305\u88c5\u5668\uff08conformal wrapper\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u53e0\u52a0\u5728\u5305\u62ec S4\u3001MC-Dropout GRU\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u66f4\u70b9\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff08bands\uff09\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4fdd\u5f62\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u540d\u4e49\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\uff08\u7a84\u533a\u95f4\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u5f62\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002"}}

Domain generalization (DG) solutions aim to address this issue by extracting domain-invariant representations that mitigate errors in unseen domains. However, in hydrological settings, each reservoir exhibits unique inflow patterns, while some metadata beyond observations like spatial information exerts indirect but significant influence. This mismatch limits the applicability of conventional DG techniques to many-domain hydrological systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose HydroDCM, a scalable DG framework for cross-reservoir inflow forecasting. Spatial metadata of reservoirs is used to construct pseudo-domain labels that guide adversarial learning of invariant temporal features. During inference, HydroDCM adapts these features through light-weight conditioning layers informed by the target reservoir's metadata, reconciling DG's invariance with location-specific adaptation. Experiment results on 30 real-world reservoirs in the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art DG baselines under many-domain conditions and remains computationally efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8de8\u6c34\u5e93\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6 HydroDCM\uff0c\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u4f2a\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u6c34\u5e93\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6761\u4ef6\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u57df\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u6587\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6c34\u5e93\u4f17\u591a\u4e14\u5165\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff08DG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u57df\u6c34\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9664\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5916\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u5bf9\u6c34\u6587\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u95f4\u63a5\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfDG\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6c34\u5e93\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u6c34\u5e93\u5143\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5c42\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9002\u914d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0a\u79d1\u7f57\u7eb3\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df\u768430\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5177\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 HydroDCM \u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6c34\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c34\u6587\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key finding is that TFMs can be pretrained entirely on synthetic datasets, opening opportunities to design data generators that encourage desirable model properties. Prior work has mainly focused on crafting high-quality priors over generators to improve overall pretraining performance. Our insight is that parameterizing the generator distribution enables an adversarial robustness perspective: during training, we can adapt the generator to emphasize datasets that are particularly challenging for the model. We formalize this by introducing an optimality gap measure, given by the difference between TFM performance and the best achievable performance as estimated by strong baselines such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forests. Building on this idea, we propose Robust Tabular Foundation Models (RTFM), a model-agnostic adversarial training framework. Applied to the TabPFN V2 classifier, RTFM improves benchmark performance, with up to a 6% increase in mean normalized AUC over the original TabPFN and other baseline algorithms, while requiring less than 100k additional synthetic datasets.

Analytic FL (AFL) provides a single-round, data distribution invariant solution, but is limited to linear models. Subsequent non-linear approaches, like DeepAFL, regain accuracy but sacrifice the single-round benefit. In this work, we break this trade-off. We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law. Empirically, SAFLe establishes a new state-of-the-art for analytic FL, significantly outperforming both linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL in accuracy across all benchmarks, demonstrating a highly efficient and scalable solution for federated vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance. This work contributes the first practical and validated framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, offering an efficient alternative to costly and risky online experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a \"momentum-like\" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "VS-Graph \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Spike Diffusion \u548c Associative Message Passing\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7 GNN \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe 450x \u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08D=128\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u800c\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1bGNNs \u867d\u5177\u5f3a\u5927\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1 HDC/VSA \u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684 HDC \u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e GNN\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u7f29\u5c0f HDC \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e GNN \u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Spike Diffusion\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Associative Message Passing\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u90bb\u57df\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 D=128 \u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3 GNN \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u5728 MUTAG \u4e0e DD \u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7684 HDC \u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 4\u20135%\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7 GNN \u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe\u7ea6 450 \u500d\uff1b\u4e14\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08D=128 \u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\uff0cVS-Graph \u5c06 HDC \u4e4b\u8f7b\u91cf\u6027\u4e0e\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u7684 ultra-efficient \u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u5728\u66f4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD).

We ask whether this training regime also helps with machine unlearning, i.e., removing the influence of specified data without full retraining. We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting.

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent.

To capture this structured heterogeneity, the Subtype and Stage Inference Event-Based Model (SuStaIn) estimates the number of subtypes, the order of disease progression for each subtype, and assigns each patient to a subtype from primarily cross-sectional data. It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn.", "AI": {"tldr": "BEBMS\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83SuStaIn\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u75c5\u7a0b\u5171\u8bc6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u7a0b\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u914d\u5230\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SuStaIn\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5206\u671f\u548c\u5206\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u5c11\u6570\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e9a\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u8fdb\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBEBMS\u5e76\u4e0eSuStaIn\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBEBMS\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5206\u671f\u3001\u5206\u578b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cBEBMS\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u5206\u671f\u548c\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8eSuStaIn\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cBEBMS\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7684\u516c\u8ba4\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u914d\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8eSuStaIn\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u79d1\u5b66\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u578b JPM\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u75c5\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\u4f5c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Pairwise\u3001Bradley-Terry\u3001Plackett-Luce\u3001Mallows \u7b49\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728 calibration\u3001separation\u3001sharpness \u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u6bd4 SA-EBM \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 21%\uff0c\u5728 NACC \u6570\u636e\u4e2d Mallows JPM \u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e AD/VaD \u7684\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u7ed3\u8bba\u543b\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\uff08EBM\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u53ea\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u75be\u75c5\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u56db\u79cd JPM \u53d8\u4f53\uff08Pairwise\u3001Bradley-Terry\u3001Plackett-Luce\u3001Mallows\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6807\u5b9a\u6027\uff08calibration\uff09\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff08separation\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u9510\u5ea6\uff08sharpness\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf SA-EBM\uff08\u5c06\u8054\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 NACC \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u4f53\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u9510\u5ea6\u968f\u53d8\u4f53\u53ca\u8f93\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d JPM \u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e SA-EBM \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 21% \u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728 NACC \u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cMallows \u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e SA-EBM \u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5173\u4e8e AD \u4e0e VaD \u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u65e2\u6709\u6587\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "JPM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u75c5\u7406\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176 Mallows \u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u8de8\u4e2a\u4f53\u8fdb\u5c55\u65f6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$.

Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency.

Interpretable Neural Networks for Time Series Regression by Learning to Mask and Aggregate", "comment": "12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables", "summary": "Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data.\n  To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa MAGNETS\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5916\u63a8\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u76d2 TSER \u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u7c97\u7cd9\u3001\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1 MAGNETS \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7ec4\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5bf9\u9009\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u523b\uff1b\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u6982\u5ff5\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdb\u884c\u63ed\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "MAGNETS \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684 TSER \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u660e\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Because these frameworks are computationally expensive, large-scale applications often rely on closed-form solutions for Gaussian distributions under quadratic cost. This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint.

This paper introduces a unified deep learning framework that integrates cyclical temporal encoding with hybrid LSTM-CNN architectures to enhance multistep energy forecasting. We systematically transform calendar-based attributes using sine cosine encodings to preserve periodic structure and evaluate their predictive relevance through correlation analysis. To exploit both long-term seasonal effects and short-term local patterns, we employ an ensemble model composed of an LSTM, a CNN, and a meta-learner of MLP regressors specialized for each forecast horizon. Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods. These findings confirm the benefit of combining cyclical temporal representations with complementary deep learning structures.

However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSAS \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53 steering \u6280\u672f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u4e5f\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u624d\u4ecb\u5165\u3001\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4ecb\u5165\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "DSAS \u5728\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5c42/\u8f93\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b83\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684 Pareto \u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDSAS \u5728\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 Pareto \u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u6709\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6298\u4e2d\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u52a0\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u4ecb\u5165\u7684 token \u53ca\u4ecb\u5165\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DSAS \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u201c\u4f55\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "While tabular machine learning has achieved remarkable success, temporal distribution shifts pose significant challenges in real-world deployment, as the relationships between features and labels continuously evolve. Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability.

However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u540c\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u5927\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1a\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d8b\u540c\uff0c\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8d70\u5411\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u53bb\u751a\u8fdc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5177\u5907\u666e\u904d\u7684\u201c universal structure\u201d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7ea7\u901a\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u652f\u6491\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6536\u655b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd160\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u201c\u7269\u8d28\u201d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8986\u76d6\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3001\u56fe\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8fd160\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5316\u5b66\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8d8b\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8fd8\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5728\u4e92\u539f\u6f5c\u5728\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u9010\u6e10\u6536\u655b\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f62\u6210\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7ea7\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u666e\u9002\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6311\u9009\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \\to B \\ne B \\to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities.

In particular, digital traces derived from the phone's embedded movement sensors present an opportunity for a forensic investigator to gain insight into a person's physical activities. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to translate digital traces into likelihood ratios (LRs) for different types of physical activities.

They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications.

Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types.

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($\u03bb$,$\u03bb$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations.

However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using \u010cech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u96c6\u89c6\u4e3a\u9762\u504f\u5e8f\u4e0a\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793aUMAP\u6743\u91cd\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684Vietoris\u2013Rips\u6ee4\u6ce1\u91c7\u6837\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u5e03CDF\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u53ef\u884d\u751f\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u5408\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u96c6\u4e0e\u5e38\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00KL\u6563\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91caUMAP\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u9762\u504f\u5e8f\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ee5\u968f\u673a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9Vietoris\u2013Rips\u6ee4\u6ce1\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5c06KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5e03\u5c14\u8fd0\u7b97\u5728\u5e95\u5c42\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u5bfc\u51fat-norm/t-conorm\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u010cech\u6ee4\u6ce1\u4e0e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u6d3e\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u7cca\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u7531\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684t-norm/t-conorm\u76f8\u5bb9\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u4ece\u8be5\u6982\u7387\u89c6\u89d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u5bfcUMAP\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u010cech\u6ee4\u6ce1\u4e0e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u91c7\u6837\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u7cca\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u96c6\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05UMAP\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Text dataset distillation initially grew as an adaptation of efforts from the vision universe, as the particularities of the modality became clear obstacles, it rose into a separate branch of research. Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications.

Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models.

Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields. This PEGP framework combines physical priors, uncertainty quantification, which can provide reliable support for TSE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff08PEGP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6d41\u91cf\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u6784\u9020\u4e24\u7c7b\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u6838\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5165\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u7a7f\u900f\u7387\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7eaf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u628a\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u7ecf\u5178\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 ARZ\u3001LWR\uff09\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u6838\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8D/NGSIM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u542b\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684PEGp \u4e0e\u65e0\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b9\u5dee\u573a\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u975e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPEGP \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1bPEGP-ARZ \u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0cPEGP-LWR \u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bc6\u96c6\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a PEGP-ARZ \u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u800c PEGP-LWR \u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e38\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u7684 PEGP \u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework.

However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Eval Factsheets \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e AI \u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u95ee\u5377\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u51b3\u7b56\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u6a21\u578b\u62e5\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u6846\u67b6\uff08Datasheets\u3001Model Cards\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6587\u6863\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6587\u6863\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u4e3a Context/Scope/Structure/Method/Alignment \u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u7efc\u8ff0\u5f0f\u3001\u5305\u542b\u5f3a\u5236\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u95ee\u5377\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u5230\u201c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u201d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "Eval Factsheets \u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff1b\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u5230 LLM \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06 Eval Factsheets \u7eb3\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u53ca\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002"}}

Users often face difficulties in choosing the most appropriate and efficient ride that would lead to both cost-effective and would take us to our destination in less time. This project provides you with the web application that helps you to select the most beneficial ride for you by providing users with the fare comparison between Ola, Uber, Rapido for the destination entered by the user. The backend is use to fetch the data, providing users with the fare comparison for the ride and finally providing with the best option using Python. This research paper also addresses the problem and challenges faced in accessing the data using APIs, Android Studios emulator, Appium and location comparison. Thus, the aim of the project is to provide transparency to the users in ride-hailing services and increase efficiency and provide users with better experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4 Ola\u3001Uber\u3001Rapido \u8f66\u8d39\u7684\u7f51\u9875/\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u540e\u53f0\u7528 Python \u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u9879\uff1b\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\u7684\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u51fa\u884c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u524d\u7aef/\u540e\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u524d\u7aef\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f93\u5165\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u7684 API \u83b7\u53d6\u4ef7\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6bd4\u4ef7\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u9879\uff1b\u8003\u8651 API \u8bbf\u95ee\u96be\u70b9\u3001Android Studio \u4eff\u771f\u3001Appium \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6bd4\u5bf9\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ef7\u683c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u9879\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347 ride-hailing \u670d\u52a1\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
