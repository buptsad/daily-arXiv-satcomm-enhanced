Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions.

First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability.

While existing defenses effectively counter obvious threats such as out-of-context trigger words and safety alignment violations, they fail against sophisticated attacks using contextually-appropriate triggers that blend seamlessly into natural language. This paper introduces three novel contextually-aware attack scenarios that exploit domain-specific knowledge and semantic plausibility: the ViralApp attack targeting social media addiction classification, the Fever attack manipulating medical diagnosis toward hypertension, and the Referral attack steering clinical recommendations. These attacks represent realistic threats where malicious actors exploit domain-specific vocabulary while maintaining semantic coherence, demonstrating how adversaries can weaponize contextual appropriateness to evade conventional detection methods. To counter both traditional and these sophisticated attacks, we present \\textbf{SCOUT (Saliency-based Classification Of Untrusted Tokens)}, a novel defense framework that identifies backdoor triggers through token-level saliency analysis rather than traditional context-based detection methods. SCOUT constructs a saliency map by measuring how the removal of individual tokens affects the model's output logits for the target label, enabling detection of both conspicuous and subtle manipulation attempts. We evaluate SCOUT on established benchmark datasets (SST-2, IMDB, AG News) against conventional attacks (BadNet, AddSent, SynBkd, StyleBkd) and our novel attacks, demonstrating that SCOUT successfully detects these sophisticated threats while preserving accuracy on clean inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSCOUT\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9SST-2\u3001IMDB\u3001AG News\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u89e6\u53d1\u8bcd\u7b49\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684 token \u7ea7\u522b\u5206\u6790\u6765\u63ed\u9732\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOUT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u8bcd\u79fb\u9664\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6765\u751f\u6210 token \u5c42\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\uff1b\u5728 SST-2\u3001IMDB\u3001AG News \u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4 BadNet\u3001AddSent\u3001SynBkd\u3001StyleBkd \u53ca\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "SCOUT\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u89e6\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4e14\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eToken\u7ea7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684SCOUT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Firstly, the equivalent sphere decoding (ESD) is proposed, which is essentially the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst sphere decoding but characterizes the sphere radius $D>0$ with two new parameters named as initial searching size $K>1$ and deviation factor $\u03c3>0$. By fixing $\u03c3$ properly, we show that given the sphere radius $D\\triangleq\u03c3\\sqrt{2\\ln K}$, the complexity of ESD in terms of the number of visited nodes is upper bounded by $|S|<nK$, thus resulting in an explicit and tractable decoding trade-off solely controlled by $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the complexity of sphere decoding is exactly specified, where considerable decoding potential can be explored from it. After that, two enhancement mechanisms named as normalized weighting and candidate protection are proposed to further upgrade the ESD algorithm. On one hand, given the same setups of $K$ and $\u03c3$, a larger sphere radius is achieved, indicating a better decoding trade-off. On the other hand, the proposed ESD algorithm is generalized, which bridges suboptimal and optimal decoding performance through the flexible choice of $K$. Finally, further performance optimization and complexity reduction with respect to ESD are also derived, and the introduced tractable and flexible decoding trade-off is verified through large-scale MIMO detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b49\u4ef7\u7403\u68c0\u6d4bESD\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\uff0cK\u4e0e\u03c3\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7403\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u5c3a\u5bf8K\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u56e0\u5b50\u03c3\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7403\u534a\u5f84 D = \u03c3 sqrt(2 ln K)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ecf\u5178Fincke-Pohst\u7403\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bbf\u95ee\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c |S| < nK\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u5019\u9009\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55ESD\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ed9\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u540c\u4e00K\u3001\u03c3\u4e0b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5927\u534a\u5f84\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u53ef\u63a7\u89e3\u7801\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7403\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06SD\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

First, we establish a Gibbs-type variational formulation of the rate-distortion function and show that optimal test channels form an exponential family, with Fullback-Leibler divergence acting as a Bregman divergence. This yields a generalized Pythagorean theorem for projections and a Legendre duality that couples distortion constraints with inverse temperature parameters. Second, the reverse water-filling metaphor is extended to distributed lattice quantization, deriving distortion allocation bounds across eigenmodes of conditional covariance matrices. Third, inference is formalized as decoding by showing that belief propagation in LDPC ensembles and polarization in polar codes can be interpreted as recursive variational inference procedures. These results unify compression, quantization, and decoding as convex projections of continuous information onto discrete manifolds. Extensions to neural compression and quantum information are sketched as corollaries, illustrating the universality of the framework.

Do"], "title": "A Unified Theory of Dynamic Programming Algorithms in Small Target Detection", "comment": "11 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Small target detection is inherently challenging due to the minimal size, lack of distinctive features, and the presence of complex backgrounds. Heavy noise further complicates the task by both obscuring and imitating the target appearance. Weak target signals require integrating target trajectories over multiple frames, an approach that can be computationally intensive. Dynamic programming offers an efficient solution by decomposing the problem into iterative maximization. This, however, has limited the analytical tools available for their study. In this paper, we present a robust framework for this class of algorithms and establish rigorous convergence results for error rates under mild assumptions. We depart from standard analysis by modeling error probabilities as a function of distance from the target, allowing us to construct a relationship between uncertainty in location and uncertainty in existence. From this framework, we introduce a novel algorithm, Normalized Path Integration (NPI), that utilizes the similarity between sequential observations, enabling target detection with unknown or time varying features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5728\u8f83\u5f31\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5f15\u5165 Normalized Path Integration (NPI) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u666e\u9002\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u5173\u7cfb\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Normalized Path Integration (NPI) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u89c2\u6d4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd9\u7c7bDP\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 NPI \u80fd\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bNPI \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5/\u65f6\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5608\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Additionally, the presence of both natural and anthropogenic acoustic sources, including shipping traffic, marine life, and geological activity, further complicates the underwater acoustic landscape. Addressing these challenges requires advanced underwater sensors and robust signal processing techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system combined with a broadband generalized sparse covariance-fitting framework for underwater target direction sensing, particularly focusing on robustness against non-uniform noise. The DAS system incorporates a newly developed spiral-sensitized optical cable, which significantly improves sensitivity compared to conventional submarine cables. This innovative design enables the system to capture acoustic signals with greater precision. Notably, the sensitivity of the spiral-wound sensitized cable is around -145.69 dB re: 1 rad / (uPa*m), as measured inside the standing-wave tube. Employing simulations, we assess the performance of the algorithm across diverse noise levels and target configurations, consistently revealing higher accuracy and reduced background noise compared to conventional beamforming techniques and other sparse techniques. In a controlled pool experiment, the correlation coefficient between waveforms acquired by the DAS system and a standard hydrophone reached 0.973, indicating high fidelity in signal capture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u7ea4DAS\u7684\u6d77\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u52a0\u4e4b\u81ea\u7136\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e3a\u58f0\u6e90\uff08\u8239\u8236\u3001\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u7269\u3001\u5730\u8d28\u6d3b\u52a8\u7b49\uff09\u4f7f\u6c34\u4e0b\u58f0\u573a\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5411\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5149\u7ea4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u58f0\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\uff08DAS\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u589e\u654f\u7535\u7f06\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9488\u5bf9\u6c34\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u62df\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u87ba\u65cb\u589e\u654f\u7535\u7f06\u63d0\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff08\u7ea6-145.69 dB re: 1 rad/(\u03bcPa\u00b7m)\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u7a00\u758f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u4eff\u771f\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u53d7\u63a7\u6c34\u6c60\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eDAS\u83b7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6c34\u58f0\u6c34\u542c\u5668\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.973\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6355\u83b7\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\u5c06DAS\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u62df\u5408\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6d77\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u87ba\u65cb\u589e\u654f\u7535\u7f06\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining \"good\" or \"bad\" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days.

However, pedestrians can become occluded by vehicles or infrastructure, creating significant safety risks due to limited visibility. Vehicle-to-everything communication enables the sharing of perception data between connected road-users, allowing for a more comprehensive awareness. The main challenge is how to fuse perception data when measurements are inconsistent with the true locations of pedestrians. Inconsistent measurements can occur due to sensor noise, false positives, or communication issues. This paper employs set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes to compute a confidence metric for the measurement set from each sensor. These sets and their confidences are then fused using hybrid zonotopes. This method can account for inconsistent measurements, enabling reliable and robust fusion of the sensor data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in both simulation and real experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Set-based perception fusion for occluded pedestrians in V2X using constrained and hybrid zonotopes.", "motivation": "Pedestrian occlusions by vehicles/infrastructure degrade perception; sharing perception data across connected road-users aims to improve situational awareness.", "method": "Employ constrained zonotopes to compute per-sensor confidence sets around measurements; fuse these sets using hybrid zonotopes to handle inconsistencies from noise, false positives, and communication issues.", "result": "Validation through simulations and real experiments shows robust and reliable fusion under inconsistent measurements.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework enables robust situational awareness by fusing set-based perception data in the presence of inconsistencies."}}

In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive--via rank analysis--the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u7684\u9006\u5411\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5355RIS\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u591aRIS\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u529f\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b97\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7684RoI\u2013\u5143\u7d20\u2013\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76 RIS \u5728\u53cd\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f90\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5355RIS\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230/\u79bbRIS\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u7f6e\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u5355\u5143\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591aRIS\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79e9\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc RoI \u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5355\u5143\u6570\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6b21\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u5b50\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u79e9\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591aRIS\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9LS\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8bef\u5dee\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u591aRIS\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u529f\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 RIS \u9006\u5411\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5f15\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

We present MiniScope, a framework that enables tool calling agents to operate on user accounts while confining potential damage from unreliable LLMs. MiniScope introduces a novel way to automatically and rigorously enforce least privilege principles by reconstructing permission hierarchies that reflect relationships among tool calls and combining them with a mobile-style permission model to balance security and ease of use. To evaluate MiniScope, we create a synthetic dataset derived from ten popular real-world applications, capturing the complexity of realistic agentic tasks beyond existing simplified benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that MiniScope incurs only 1-6% latency overhead compared to vanilla tool calling agents, while significantly outperforming the LLM based baseline in minimizing permissions as well as computational and operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiniScope is a framework that enables tool-calling agents to operate on user accounts with automatic, rigorous least-privilege enforcement by reconstructing permission hierarchies and applying a mobile-style permission model, achieving low overhead.", "motivation": "Tool-calling agents in LLM deployments pose security risks due to unreliable LLMs; existing approaches (manual policies or confinement loops) lack rigorous guarantees or are hard to use.

In this work, we close this gap by establishing recovery guarantees for (exact and approximate) $3$-designs that parallel the best-known results for $4$-designs.

While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation.

Recent works proposed ASICs to accelerate FHE, but require expensive advanced manufacturing processes that constrain their accessibility. GPUs are a far more accessible platform, but achieving ASIC-level performance using GPUs has remained elusive. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on small models that fit comfortably within a single device. Supporting large models such as LLMs in FHE introduces a dramatic increase in computational complexity that requires optimized GPU kernels, along with managing terabyte-scale memory footprints that far exceed the capacity of a single GPU. This paper presents Cerium, a multi-GPU framework for FHE inference on large models. Cerium integrates a domain-specific language, an optimizing compiler, and a runtime system to automatically generate high-performance GPU kernels, manage terabyte-scale memory footprints, and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. It introduces new IR constructs, compiler passes, sparse polynomial representations, memory-efficient data layouts, and communication-aware parallelization techniques that together enable encrypted inference for models ranging from small CNNs to Llama3-8B. We build Cerium on NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrate significant performance gains. For small models, Cerium outperforms expert-written hand-optimized GPU libraries by up to 2.25 times. Cerium achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art FHE ASICs, outright matching prior FHE ASIC CraterLake.

However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly.

Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems.

When these connections differ, the resulting trajectory discrepancy--termed the Latent Error Dynamic Response (LEDR)--acquires an intrinsic dynamical structure governed by curvature. We show that the LEDR satisfies a Jacobi-type equation, where curvature mismatch acts as an explicit forcing term. In the important case of a flat model connection, the LEDR reduces to a classical Jacobi field on the true manifold, causing Model Error Resonance (MER) to emerge under positive sectional curvature. The theory is extended to a discrete-time analogue, establishing that this geometric structure and its resonant behavior persist in sampled systems. A closed-form analysis of a sphere--plane example demonstrates that curvature can be inferred directly from the LEDR evolution.

Its ability to penetrate lightweight materials such as packaging or thin walls enables non-visual sensing in industrial and automated environments and can provide robotic platforms with enhanced environmental perception when used alongside optical sensors. Recent work with MIMO mmWave radar has demonstrated its ability to penetrate cardboard packaging for occluded object classification. However, existing models leave room for improvement and warrant a more thorough evaluation across different sensing frequencies. In this paper, we propose ACCOR, an attention-enhanced complex-valued contrastive learning approach for radar, enabling robust occluded object classification. We process complex-valued IQ radar signals using a complex-valued CNN backbone, followed by a multi-head attention layer and a hybrid loss. Our proposed loss combines a weighted cross-entropy term with a supervised contrastive term. We further extend an existing 64 GHz dataset with a 67 GHz subset of the occluded objects and evaluate our model using both center frequencies. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms prior radar-specific models and image classification models with adapted input, achieving classification accuracies of 96.60% at 64 GHz and 93.59% at 67 GHz for ten different objects.

However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity.

Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our model also automatically rediscovers three classes of known attacks, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in the protocol design. To bridge the model-to-reality gap, we validate our findings through targeted testing of mainstream DNS software and a large-scale measurement study of over 2.2 million open resolvers, confirming the real-world impact of these flaws.

In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of inference time reasoning methods applied across both open-source and closed-source VLMs on different benchmarks. Our results reveal that while closed-source models consistently benefit from structured reasoning and iterative Self-Refinement, open-source VLMs show inconsistent behavior: external verification provides the most reliable gains, whereas iterative refinement often degrades performance. We further find that the effectiveness of TTS is dataset-dependent, yielding clear improvements on multi-step reasoning tasks but offering only limited gains on perception-focused benchmarks.

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that enables project maintainers to create custom workflows -- collections of jobs composed of sequential steps -- using reusable components known as actions. Wary of the security risks introduced by fully-privileged actions, GitHub provides a job-level permission model for controlling workflow access to repository resources. Unfortunately, this model is too coarse-grained to reduce the attack surface pertaining to permission misuse attacks: All actions within a job share the same permissions granted to the job. This violates the principle of least privilege and can lead to broader software supply chain attacks, whenever a compromised action exploits the granted permissions to compromise the repository resources. In this paper, we present Granite, a runtime proxy-based system that enforces fine-grained permissions for GitHub Actions at the step-level granularity within a job. Granite transparently monitors requests made by JavaScript and composite actions during workflow execution and checks them against predefined step-level policies at runtime. We evaluate Granite in terms of compatibility, security, and performance overhead using a dataset of 500 workflows comprising 12,916 jobs from the most-starred GitHub repositories that use GitHub Actions. Our analysis reveals that 52.7% of the jobs can be protected by Granite against permission misuse attacks. We evaluate Granite on 20 top-starred repositories (63 actions, 58 workflows), validate attack prevention using 10 permission misuse attacks across 42 overprivileged jobs, and measure an average overhead of 55% (3.67 seconds) per job, concluding that Granite effectively reduces CI/CD attack surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Granite introduces runtime, step-level permission enforcement for GitHub Actions to mitigate permission misuse, protecting about half of jobs in real-world datasets, at the cost of ~55% average per-job overhead (\u22483.67s).", "motivation": "Coarse-grained job-level permissions in GitHub Actions expose the CI/CD attack surface.

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design.", "AI": {"tldr": "BNN surrogate models can outperform GP surrogates for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional, dense controller parameterizations, enabling efficient learning in closed-loop control (hundreds to thousands of parameters).", "motivation": "Improve BO performance for dense, high-dimensional controller parameterizations where standard surrogates (e.g., Matern GP) struggle to capture structure and scale.", "method": "Systematic comparison of three surrogate models (Gaussian process with Matern kernel, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks) as surrogates in Bayesian optimization on a cart-pole task; evaluate convergence of closed-loop cost across varying parameter dimensions.", "result": "BNN surrogates achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost; can optimize parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions; infinite-width BNNs maintain performance for >1000 parameters; Matern GP deteriorates in high dimensions.", "conclusion": "Bayesian neural network surrogates are suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and provide guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design."}}

A plausible approach to protecting this metadata is to have senders post encrypted messages on a public bulletin board and receivers scan it for relevant messages. Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to improve user experience in this solution by delegating the scan to a resource-rich server while preserving privacy. A key process in OMR is the homomorphic detection of pertinent messages for the receiver from the bulletin board. It relies on a specialized matrix-vector multiplication algorithm, which involves extensive multiplications between ciphertext vectors and plaintext matrices, as well as homomorphic rotations. The computationally intensive nature of this process limits the practicality of OMR. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication algorithm. The building homomorphic operators in this algorithm are implemented using high-level synthesis, with design parameters for different parallelism levels. These operators are then deployed on a field-programmable gate array platform using an efficient design space exploration strategy to accelerate homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr":

Our results demonstrate that the VL achieves machine precision ($\\text{MSE} \\approx 10^{-33}$) on exact reconstruction tasks and exhibits superior stability in the presence of incoherent sensor noise ($\\text{MSE} \\approx 0.03$), effectively acting as a physics-informed spectral filter.

LLMs are increasingly being used to process untrusted text inputs and even generate executable code, often while having access to sensitive system controls. To address these security concerns, several companies have introduced guard models, which are smaller, specialized models designed to protect text generation models from adversarial or malicious inputs. In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal that Llama Prompt Guard 2 can be compromised through joint optimization.\n  Additionally, by analyzing the changing similarity of a model's internal state to specific concept directions during token sequence processing, we propose an effective and lightweight method to detect Super Suffix attacks. We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent. Our proposed countermeasure, DeltaGuard, significantly improves the detection of malicious prompts generated through Super Suffixes. It increases the non-benign classification rate to nearly 100%, making DeltaGuard a valuable addition to the guard model stack and enhancing robustness against adversarial prompt attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Super Suffixes\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u5e76\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u653b\u51fb Llama Prompt Guard 2 \u7b49\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa DeltaGuard\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5939\u89d2\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1 100%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u843d\u5730\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b88\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\uff08guard models\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u9762\u524d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u201cSuper Suffixes\u201d\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd tokenize \u65b9\u6848\u7684\u540e\u7f00\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ed5\u8fc7 Llama Prompt Guard 2 \u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u968f token \u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5 DeltaGuard\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u6307\u7eb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSuper Suffixes \u80fd\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e94\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9632\u62a4\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a Llama Prompt Guard 2 \u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002DeltaGuard \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u901a\u8fc7 Super Suffixes \u751f\u6210\u7684\u975e\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1 100%\u3002", "conclusion": "DeltaGuard \u4e3a\u5b88\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u6808\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b88\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u5206\u8bcd\u67b6\u6784\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8584\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features.

However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains. This research advances the goal of building data-informed urban systems in a scalable way, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in smart city analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u57df\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u65b0\u57ce\u5e02\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u6784\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u540e\u7528\u4e8e\u9762\u5411\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u57df\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u65f6\u7a7a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u7a7a\u95f4-\u53d8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u672c\u5730\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7ea650\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u3001\u72af\u7f6a\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\uff09\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5bf9\u65b0\u5730\u533a/\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u91cd\u6784\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u57ce\u591a\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u5730\u533a/\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u6781\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4e9f\u9700\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Hendryx", "Vaskar Nath"], "title": "Progress over Points: Reframing LM Benchmarks Around Scientific Objectives", "comment": null, "summary": "Current benchmarks that test LLMs on static, already-solved problems (e.g., math word problems) effectively demonstrated basic capability acquisition. The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems.

Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLU\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u88ab\u8bef\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\u5bfc\u81f4\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cReLU\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728PINN\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0cReLU\u7b49\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u843d\u540e\u4e8esigmoid\u3001tanh\u3001swish\u7b49\u5e73\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u65f6\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408PyTorch\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u9519\u4f4d\uff1b\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1ReLU\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "ReLU\u5728\u4ee5\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAD\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u88ab\u9519\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLU\u5728PINN\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u7a33\u5065\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u5904\u7406\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6539\u7528\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u6539\u8fdbAD\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6b63\u786e\u6355\u6349\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\uff09"}}

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction.

We make an attempt by studying rank constraints, which, as a generalization to conditional independence constraints, exploits the ranks of covariance submatrices in linear Gaussian models. We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms. We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of such rank constraints. Using this tool, we demonstrate that the one-factor model, a classical latent variable model, can be identified under selection bias.

Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand.

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRLR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u63a8\u65adPLC\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728ICS\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea639%\u3002", "motivation": "PLC\u5e38\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u9700\u6c42\u89c4\u8303/\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6216\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ICS\u7279\u6027\uff1a1) \u5c06\u91cd\u8981\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u4ee5\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u65f6\u57df\uff1b2) \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u4e0d\u9891\u7e41\uff1b3) \u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u8f93\u5165\u6709\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b4) \u5c06\u4ee5\u4e0a\u56e0\u7d20\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u516c\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u641c\u7d22\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdICS\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cSRLR\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea639%\uff1b\u5728\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ICS\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\uff0cSRLR\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u6062\u590d\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6/\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "QGEC using Golay code with Transformer decoding; Golay code (23 data qubits, d=7) decodes more accurately than toric code (50 data qubits, d=5) under certain noise models, suggesting efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation.", "motivation": "Explore whether a classical Golay code combined with Transformer-based decoding can improve quantum error correction efficiency and fault-tolerance.", "method": "Propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC) using the Golay code; evaluate Transformer-based decoders trained on Golay and toric codes under multiple noise models.

While continual learning has been extended to dynamic graphs, existing methods overlook the effects of topological changes on existing nodes. To address it, we propose a novel framework for continual learning on dynamic graphs, named Condensation-Concatenation-based Continual Learning (CCC). Specifically, CCC first condenses historical graph snapshots into compact semantic representations while aiming to preserve the original label distribution and topological properties.

Effective battery health management is essential for battery system safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. In this paper, we propose Pace, a physics-aware attentive temporal convolutional network for battery health estimation. Pace integrates raw sensor measurements with battery physics features derived from the equivalent circuit model. We develop three battery-specific modules, including dilated temporal blocks for efficient temporal encoding, chunked attention blocks for context modeling, and a dual-head output block for fusing short- and long-term battery degradation patterns. Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions. In a large public dataset, Pace performs much better than existing models, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.5 and 2.0x compared to two best-performing baseline models. We further demonstrate its practical viability with a real-time edge deployment on a Raspberry Pi.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "EDPs\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660eEDP\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0MDP\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6269\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a principled \u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u7b49\u53d8\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684RL\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u53d1\u6563\u6291\u5236\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u9650\u6f14\u793a\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u7b49\u53d8RL\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u6548\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u8bc1\u660e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u8bc1\u660eEDP\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0MDP\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u7b49\u53d8\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8RL\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684RL\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff1a\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u907f\u514d\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53d1\u6563\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u6781\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7eb3\u5165EDP\u8c03\u63a7\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u7406\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.\n  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAT is a context-aware GNN model for trust prediction that handles dynamicity, heterogeneity, and context-awareness, using continuous-time dynamics, dual attention, and meta-path-based context features to achieve superior performance and robustness.", "motivation": "Current GNN-based trust prediction models struggle to capture trust dynamics, often ignore network heterogeneity, and lack context-aware capabilities, leading to less accurate or coarse predictions.", "method": "CAT architecture with four layers: graph construction, embedding, heterogeneous attention, and prediction.

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks.

In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data.

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario.

However, achieving such cross-dataset, fully inductive inference is difficult in graph-structured data where feature spaces vary widely in both dimensionality and semantics. Any transformation in the feature space can easily violate the inductive applicability to unseen datasets, strictly limiting the design space of a graph model. In this work, we introduce the view space, a novel representational axis in which arbitrary graphs can be naturally encoded in a unified manner.

However, interpretability requires both sensible linguistic partitions and small rule-base sizes, which are not guaranteed by many existing fuzzy rule-mining algorithms. Evolutionary approaches can produce high-quality models but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while neural-based methods like ANFIS have problems retaining linguistic interpretations. In this work, we propose an adaptation of classical tree-based splitting algorithms from crisp rules to fuzzy trees, combining the computational efficiency of greedy algoritms with the interpretability advantages of fuzzy logic. This approach achieves interpretable linguistic partitions and substantially improves running time compared to evolutionary-based approaches while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Our experiments on tabular classification benchmarks proof that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers with significantly lower computational cost and produces more interpretable rule bases with constrained complexity.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations.

We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u975e\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5728-context\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d4b\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651i.i.d.\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u6781\u9650\u4e0bsoftmax\u6536\u655b\u4e3a\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165- token\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728sub-Gaussian\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5c06\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7528\u4e8e\u5728-context\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8be5\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u4e0bsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ee7\u627f\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u4e0bsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u5957\u539f\u7406\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC). The method is metric--agnostic and broadly applicable to any domain where performance can be evaluated incrementally over non-repeating element sequences, providing a unified geometric approach to uncovering interaction structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4e14\u5ea6\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u9010\u6b65\u52a0\u5165\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u7ed8\u5236\u5176\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684L\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7528L-score\u5728-1\u52301\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u5b9a\u91cf\u533a\u5206\u534f\u540c\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1a\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u884c\u52a8\u5f7c\u6b64\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u72ec\u7acb\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5143\u7d20\u4ee5\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u9010\u4e2a\u6dfb\u52a0\uff0c\u8de8\u5927\u91cf\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed8\u5236\u5176\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u5c06\u6210\u5bf9\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u82e5\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u5219\u5f62\u6210\u53ea\u6709\u524d\u8005\u8d21\u732e\u7684L\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u82e5\u5b58\u5728\u534f\u540c\u5219\u5f62\u6210\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u8005\u5171\u540c\u8d21\u732e\u7684L\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7L-score\u5c06\u4e24\u70b9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u503c\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u4ece-1\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u5982Y=X1X2\uff09\u52300\uff08\u72ec\u7acb\uff09\u5230+1\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5982X1\u2248X2\uff09\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9L\u5f62\u4e24\u81c2\u7684\u523b\u5ea6\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u652f\u914d\u6027\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5ea6\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u5728\u975e\u91cd\u590d\u5143\u7d20\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684L\u5f62\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u4e24\u81c2\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u957f\u5ea6/\u89d2\u5ea6\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\uff1b\u72ec\u7acb\u5143\u7d20\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ea\u662f\u6210\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8de8\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e09\u5143\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002", "conclusion": "L-score\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u523b\u753b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u534f\u540c\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5747\u5177\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6210\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}
