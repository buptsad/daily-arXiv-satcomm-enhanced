However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility. Extensive validation across diverse protein design scenarios demonstrates PepBridge's efficacy in generating structurally viable proteins, representing a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "PepBridge \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5\u53d7\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u70b9\u4e91\u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u53d7\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u914d\u4f53\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u7531\u591a\u6a21\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 Shape-Frame Matching Network \u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u9762\u4e92\u8865\u3001\u6784\u8c61\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u86cb\u767d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u884c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u9876\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08PPIs\uff09\u53d7\u8868\u9762\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u758f\u6c34\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53d7\u4f53\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4e92\u8865\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u53d7\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff08DDBMs\uff09\u5c06\u53d7\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u914d\u4f53\u8868\u9762\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528 Shape-Frame Matching Networks \u786e\u4fdd\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4e3b\u94fe\u9aa8\u67b6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b5) \u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u9762\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3001\u6784\u8c61\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9 PepBridge \u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u884c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8868\u9762-\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "PepBridge \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d7\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u9762-\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily.

A new design technique based on a Goldberg discretization and unit cell scaling technique is introduced to accommodate the curved profile of the FSS. The FSS is additively manufactured by sequentially printing dielectric layers and metallic patterns until 3 patterned silver-ink surfaces are integrated within a 4.5 mm (${\u03bb_0}/6$ at 10 GHz) thick ABS hemispherical radome. The diameter and the height of the realized hemispherical FSS are around $5{\u03bb_0}$ and $3{\u03bb_0}$ respectively. Measurements demonstrate a roughly 1.7 dB insertion loss in the passband and 15-20 dB rejection in the stop-band. Additionally, a new postprocessing technique is used to suppress the effects of edge diffraction in the measured transmission spectrum.

UL-MIMO enables the transmission of two data streams on one frequency band in strong RF conditions, theoretically doubling throughput and efficiency. On the other hand, UL-CA allows for simultaneous upload on greater channel widths, allowing more resources to be assigned to a single UE for higher throughput. In the United States, T-Mobile USA, a mobile network operator (MNO), has deployed network-wide 5G Standalone (SA), along with UL-MIMO on Time Division Duplex (TDD) band n41 and UL-CA between TDD and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) NR bands.

While it is well known that the Gaussian prior uniquely induces linear conditional means under Gaussian noise, the analogous question for the conditional median (i.e., the optimal estimator under absolute-error loss) has only recently been settled. Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the L\u00e9vy metric.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs.

However, due to the inflexibility of the minimum error entropy (MEE), this algorithm demonstrates limited robustness when confronted with more complex noise environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a generalized mixture minimum error entropy-based (GMMEE) square-root cubature Kalman filter (GMMEE-SRCKF). The square-root algorithm ensures improved numerical stability and avoids covariance degeneration, while the GMMEE criterion with two flexible kernels adapts effectively to non-Gaussian noise. Moreover, a hybrid tree seed and genetic algorithm (TSGA) is introduced to optimize the kernel parameters automatically.

We show that asymptotically in both the field size q and the dimensions of the two codes, the expected dimension reaches its maximum. Lastly, we discuss some implications related to private information retrieval, secure distributed matrix multiplication, quantum error correction, and the potential for exploiting the results in cryptanalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7684\u661f\u79ef\uff08star product\uff09\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u671f\u671b\u503c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7801\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u4e0d\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u661f\u79ef\u4e0e\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u661f\u79ef\u7ef4\u6570\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u5728\u57df\u5927\u5c0f q \u4ee5\u53ca\u7801\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u5747\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u7ef4\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u4ee5\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u5206\u6790\u5229\u7528\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u79ef\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u661f\u79ef\u7684\u7ef4\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u661f\u79ef\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u661f\u79ef\u4e0e\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed9\u51fa\u661f\u79ef\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u5bf9\u57df\u5927\u5c0f q \u4e0e\u4e24\u7801\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u6781\u9650\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u671f\u671b\u7ef4\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u5176\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u661f\u79ef\u7ef4\u6570\u671f\u671b\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 q \u4e0e\u7801\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u7ef4\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u5927\u57df\u548c\u5927\u7801\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u4e24\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7684\u661f\u79ef\u7ef4\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u7801\u7684\u661f\u79ef\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u661f\u79ef\u7ef4\u6570\u7684\u6781\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u653b\u51fb/\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation.

While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rond\u00f4nia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%).

However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u6620\u5c04\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u7ef4\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u9ad8\u7ef4CSI\uff0c\u5728NLOS\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee5\u5927\u91cf\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684CSI\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u524d\u63d0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fCSI\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758fCSI\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u89d2\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ca\u76f8\u90bb\u6837\u672c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u7684RNN-CNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6784\u5b8c\u6574CSI\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfKalman\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc730%\uff0c\u5728NLOS\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea620%\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u548cCSI\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Both problems are computationally challenging because the structural constraints are difficult to enforce directly. We show that both tasks can be solved efficiently and optimally by applying the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm for spectral estimation. For a rank $r$ Toeplitz matrix ${\\boldsymbol T}\\in {\\mathbb C}^{n\\times n}$ that satisfies a regularity assumption and is corrupted by an arbitrary ${\\boldsymbol E}\\in {\\mathbb C}^{n\\times n}$ such that $\\|{\\boldsymbol E}\\|_2\\leq \u03b1n$, our algorithm outputs a Toeplitz matrix $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol T}$ of rank exactly $r$ such that $\\|{\\boldsymbol T}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol T}\\|_2 \\leq C \\sqrt r \\, \\|{\\boldsymbol E}\\|_2$, where $C,\u03b1>0$ are absolute constants.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83FedAvg\u3001FedProx\u4e0eScaffold\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CICIoT2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u591a\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u662fFL\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5bf9FedAvg\u3001FedProx\u4e0eScaffold\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff08IID\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u975eIID\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CICIoT2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21IoT\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u975eIID\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aFedAvg\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bFedProx\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\uff1bScaffold\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5728IoT\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684FL\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize).

Traditional controllers provide only limited adaptability, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), though promising, suffers from sample inefficiency, weak long-term planning, and lacks stability guarantees, leading to unreliable behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-prior Lyapunov actor-critic framework that unifies exploration, stability, and semantic adaptability. Specifically, a diffusion model generates smooth, multimodal, and disturbance-resilient candidate actions; a Lyapunov critic further imposes dual constraints that ensure stability; and a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven outer loop adaptively selects and refines Lyapunov functions based on task semantics and training feedback. This \"generation-filtering-optimization\" mechanism not only enhances sample efficiency and planning capability but also aligns stability guarantees with diverse mission requirements in the multi-objective optimization task. Extensive simulations under complex ocean dynamics demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves more accurate trajectory tracking, higher task completion rates, improved energy efficiency, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional RL and diffusion-augmented baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u7684Lyapunov\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eAUV\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001Lyapunov\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5916\u73af\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "AUV\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8bed\u4e49\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e14\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Lyapunov\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u4ee5\u53cc\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5916\u73af\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e refinement Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u201c\u751f\u6210-\u7b5b\u9009-\u4f18\u5316\u201d\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u6d0b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684 extensive simulations \u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfRL\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AUV\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6d77\u6d0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing designs sit at two costly extremes: dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer fine beam control but require dense cabling, continuous power consumption, and substantial signaling overhead, whereas low-cost static surfaces require no control lines or electronics but are limited to a single beam pattern. This disparity leaves a practical gap for quasi-static environments, such as industrial Internet-of-things and smart agriculture scenarios, where channels are stable with user demands changing only occasionally or periodically, and neither extreme is sufficiently economical or flexible. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel movable intelligent surface (MIS) architecture, whose beam patterns are switched not by electronic phase tuning but by mechanically sliding a small, pre-phased secondary metasurface layer across a larger, likewise static primary layer. We develop an MIS signal model that characterizes the interaction between static phase elements with dynamic geometry via binary selection matrices. Based on this model, we formulate a new type of optimization problems that jointly design static phase shifts and the overlapping position selection of MS2 (equal to beam pattern scheduling). Efficient algorithms based on the penalty method, block coordinate descent, and Riemannian manifold optimization are proposed to tackle these mixed-integer non-convex problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIS architecture substantially narrows the performance gap between single-layer static surfaces and dynamic RISs, providing a practical and flexible solution for quasi-static wireless applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08MIS\uff09\u4ee5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u4e3b\u5c42\u4e0a\u6ed1\u52a8\u6b21\u7ea7\u9884\u76f8\u4f4d\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u6ce2\u675f\uff0c\u4ecb\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u8868\u9762\u548c\u52a8\u6001RIS\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709 RIS \u7684\u4e24\u7aef\u6210\u672c/\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6781\u7aef\uff1a\u52a8\u6001 RIS \u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e03\u7ebf\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u4f9b\u7535\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u9762\u677f\u867d\u7136\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4f46\u4ec5\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6ce2\u675f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u3001\u667a\u6167\u519c\u4e1a\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MIS \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e3b\u9759\u6001\u5c42\u4e0a\u6ed1\u52a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u9884\u76f8\u4f4d\u6b21\u7ea7\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u6ce2\u675f\u6a21\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u77e9\u9635\u5207\u6362\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb MIS \u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u4f4d\u5143\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u8026\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9759\u6001\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c MS2 \u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5373\u6ce2\u675f\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u6cd5\u3001\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a MIS \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u5355\u5c42\u9759\u6001\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001 RIS \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "MIS \u4e3a\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u6298\u4e2d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ecb\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u65e0\u63a7\u5236\u7ebf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001 RIS \u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This work introduces a new paradigm with a core objective: to perform fast, data-efficient, and high-fidelity RF reconstruction of occluded 3D static scenes, using only a single, brief human walk. We argue that this unstructured motion is not noise, but is in fact an information-rich signal available for reconstruction. To achieve this, we design a factorization framework based on composite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that learns to model the dynamic effects of human motion from the persistent static scene geometry within a raw RF stream. Trained on just a single 60-second casual walk, our model reconstructs the full static scene with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, remarkably outperforming heavily-sampled state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 12%. By transforming the human movements into its valuable signals, our method eliminates the data acquisition bottleneck and paves the way for on-the-fly 3D RF mapping of unseen environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b2160\u79d2\u6b65\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u590d\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u70b9\u7684\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa3D\u5c04\u7ebf\u573a\uff0c\u8fbe\u52300.96\u7684SSIM\uff0c\u8f83SOTA\u63d0\u5347\u7ea612%\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u6709\u906e\u6321\u76843D\u5c04\u7ebf\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u9759\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u70b9\u7684\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff083DGS\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u539f\u59cbRF\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4ec5\u5728\u5355\u6b2160\u79d2\u7684\u968f\u610f\u6b65\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SSIM 0.96\uff0c\u8f83 heavily-sampled SOTA\u63d0\u5347\u7ea612%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5373\u65f63D RF\u6620\u5c04\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although all of these approaches increase the trust in the application at runtime, an often overlooked aspect is the integrity and confidentiality protection at build time, which is equally important as maliciously injected code during compilation can compromise the entire application and system.In this paper, we present Tical, a practical framework for trusted compilation that provides integrity protection and confidentiality in build pipelines from source code to the final executable. Our approach harnesses TEEs as runtime protection but enriches TEEs with file system shielding and an immutable audit log with version history to provide accountability. This way, we can ensure that the compiler chain can only access trusted files and intermediate output, such as object files produced by trusted processes.

Existing damping strategies based on power modulation of high voltage DC (HVDC) or energy storage, are often limited by fixed control architectures, leaving some modes poorly damped. This paper introduces a state-derivative feedback (SDF) damping controller that uses both frequency and its rate of change as feedback signals. Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme.

Concurrently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are integral to future networks, necessitating channel models that capture both multipath fading and shadowing. This letter presents a novel performance analysis of a UAV-to-ground link, where the receiver is equipped with an $N$-port FAS operating over the challenging double-shadowing fading channel. By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function. Based on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally, a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a multiplicative diversity order of $G_d = M \\times d$, which is precisely the product of the FAS spatial rank $M$ and the intrinsic channel diversity order $d$.

The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization.

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, under packet-based communication protocols, any error typically results in the loss of an entire packet, making semantic communication particularly vulnerable to packet loss. Since high-dimensional semantic features must be partitioned into one-dimensional transmission units during packetization. A critical open question is how to partition semantic features to maximize robustness. To address this, we systematically investigate the performance of two mainstream architectures, Transformer and Convolutional neural networks (CNN), under various feature partitioning schemes. The results show that the Transformer architecture exhibits inherent robustness to packet loss when partitioned along the channel dimension. In contrast, the CNN-based baseline exhibits imbalanced channel utilization, causing severe degradation once dominant channels are lost. To enhance the CNN resilience, we propose a lightweight Semantic Equalization Mechanism (SEM) that balances channel contributions and prevents a few channels from dominating. SEM consists of two parallel approaches: a Dynamic Scale module that adaptively adjusts channel importance, and a Broadcast module that facilitates information interaction among channels. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN equipped with SEM achieve graceful degradation under packet loss (retaining about 85% of lossless PSNR at 40% packet loss), comparable to that of Transformer models. Our findings indicate that, under an appropriate partitioning strategy, maintaining a balanced semantic representation is a fundamental condition for achieving intrinsic robustness against packet loss. These insights may also extend to other modalities such as video and support practical semantic communication design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u51b3\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1bTransformer\u5bf9\u6309\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5206\u533a\u7684\u5305\u4e22\u5931\u5177\u6709\u5929\u7136\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1bCNN\u82e5\u914d\u5408SEM\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eTransformer\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5206\u7ec4\u5305\u65f6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u533a\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5bf9\u5305\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83Transformer\u4e0eCNN\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8CNN\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684SEM\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30Transformer\u4e0eCNN\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff08SEM\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e7f\u64ad\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CNN\u5bf9\u5305\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u8010\u53d7\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cfPSNR\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u5728\u6309\u7167\u901a\u9053\u5206\u533a\u65f6\u5bf9\u5305\u4e22\u5931\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1bCNN\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u5bfc\u901a\u9053\u4e22\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bSEM\u4f7fCNN\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u964d\u89e3\uff0c\u572840%\u5305\u4e22\u5931\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6lossless PSNR\u768485%\uff0c\u4e0eTransformer\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5305\u4e22\u5931\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1bSEM\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u89c2\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u6001\u3002"}}

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers.

Preprint on cryptographic evidence and compliance for regulated AI workflows", "summary": "This paper introduces constant-size cryptographic evidence structures, a general abstraction for representing verifiable audit evidence for AI workflows in regulated environments. Each evidence item is a fixed-size tuple of cryptographic fields, designed to (i) provide strong binding to workflow events and configurations, (ii) support constant-size storage and uniform verification cost per event, and (iii) compose cleanly with hash-chain and Merkle-based audit constructions. We formalize a simple model of regulated AI workflows, define syntax and algorithms for evidence structures, and articulate security goals such as audit integrity and non-equivocation. We present a generic hash-and-sign construction that instantiates this abstraction using a collision-resistant hash function and a standard digital signature scheme. We then show how to integrate the construction with hash-chained logs, Merkle-tree anchoring, and optionally trusted execution environments, and we analyze the asymptotic complexity of evidence generation and verification. Finally, we implement a prototype library and report microbenchmark results on commodity hardware, demonstrating that the per-event overhead of constant-size evidence is small and predictable. The design is informed by industrial experience with regulated AI systems at Codebat Technologies Inc., while the paper focuses on the abstraction, algorithms, and their security and performance characteristics, with implications for clinical trial management, pharmaceutical compliance, and medical AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u54c8\u5e0c\u94fe/ Merkle \u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u683c\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u53ef\u62b5\u8d56\u7684\u3001\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u5bb9\u54c8\u5e0c\u94fe\u548cMerkle\u7b49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u62b5\u649e\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u9879\uff08\u6052\u5b9a\u5143\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e0e\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6765\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u54c8\u5e0c\u94fe\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001Merkle\u951a\u5b9a\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u96c6\u6210\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5426\u8ba4\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e0e\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e38\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5546\u54c1\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5fae\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6bcf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u533b\u836f\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u533b\u7597AI\u6cbb\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u4eca\u540e\u5c06\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Dynamic, continuously adaptable resilience is required to ensure their functionality under variable conditions. However, existing resilience architectures usually only deal with adaptation implicitly and thus remain predominantly static. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a new Adaptive Coordination Layer (ACL) and conceptually redefining the Adaptation & Learning Layer (AL). The ACL acts as an operational control layer that detects risks in real time, prioritises countermeasures and coordinates them dynamically. The AL is reinterpreted as a strategic-cooperative layer that evaluates the operational decisions of the ACL, learns from them, and derives long-term adjustments at the policy, governance, and architecture levels. Together, both layers operationalise the resilience principle of adaptation and combine short-term responsiveness with long-term learning and development capabilities. The paper describes various implementation variants of both levels - from rule-based and KPI-driven approaches to AI-supported and meta-learning mechanisms - and shows how these can be combined depending on system complexity, data availability and degree of regulation. The proposed architecture model no longer understands resilience as a static system property, but as a continuous, data-driven process of mutual coordination and systemic learning. This creates a methodological basis for the next generation of adaptive and resilient CPSoS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411CPSoS\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u97e7\u6027\u67b6\u6784\uff1aACL\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\uff0cAL\u7528\u4e8e\u6218\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u6cbb\u7406\uff1b\u5c06\u97e7\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u77ed\u671f\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "CPSoS \u73af\u5883\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u97e7\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49 ACL\uff08\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\uff09\u4e0e AL\uff08\u6218\u7565\u2014\u5408\u4f5c\u5c42\uff09\u7684\u804c\u8d23\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ece\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u3001KPI \u9a71\u52a8\u5230 AI \u652f\u6301\u3001\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5 ACL \u548c AL \u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u77ed\u671f\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c06\u97e7\u6027\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u97e7\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 ACL \u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u534f\u540c\u4e0e AL \u7684\u6218\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684 CPSoS \u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Given the site-specific spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel, non-RF sensor inputs and environment awareness can be leveraged to greatly enhance beam management decisions, e.g. via machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the current literature lacks open platforms to gather datasets for the training of such ML techniques and to evaluate novel beam management approaches in real-time, real-world scenarios and full-stack endto-end networks. In this work, we present our SDR-based experimental platform based on OpenAirInterface and are the first to integrate popular low-cost antenna array transceivers, beam sweeping capabilities, and a highly-modular sensor framework and associated interfaces into such a full-stack experimental platform.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b conformal prediction\uff08ordinal-CP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u77ed\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u7ea615%\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e8f\u6570\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e8f\u6570 CP \u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7ed9\u51fa\u8986\u76d6-\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6743\u8861\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u6570 CP \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e8f\u6570 CP \u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u5b9a\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u5019\u9009\u6570 K \u7ebf\u6027\uff1b\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5728\u671f\u671b\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002\u53e6\u7ed9\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u957f\u5ea6\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea615%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u6570 CP \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We show that intermediate activations in decoder-only LLMs form a vulnerable attack surface for behavioral control. Building on recent findings on attention sinks and compression valleys, we identify a high-gain region in the residual stream where small, well-aligned perturbations are causally amplified along the autoregressive trajectory--a Causal Amplification Effect (CAE). We exploit this as an attack surface via Sensitivity-Scaled Steering (SSS), a progressive activation-level attack that combines beginning-of-sequence (BOS) anchoring with sensitivity-based reinforcement to focus a limited perturbation budget on the most vulnerable layers and tokens. We show that across multiple open-weight models and four behavioral axes, SSS induces large shifts in evil, hallucination, sycophancy, and sentiment while preserving high coherence and general capabilities, turning activation steering into a concrete security concern for white-box and supply-chain LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f0f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff08CAE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6270\u52a8\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u653e\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff08SSS\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9LLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u524d\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u7136\u800c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\u901a\u9053\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7aef\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90/\u767d\u76d2\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u589e\u76ca\u533a\uff08CAEs\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c0f\u7684\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9014\u4e2d\u88ab\u653e\u5927\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08SSS\uff09\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7ea7\u522b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BOS\u951a\u5b9a\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u6309\u9884\u7b97\u805a\u7126\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5c42\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u56db\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u8f74\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u56db\u4e2a\u884c\u4e3a\u8f74\u4e0a\uff0cSSS\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1 evil\u3001hallucination\u3001sycophancy\u3001sentiment \u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6210\u4e3a\u767d\u76d2\u4e0e\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u524d\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9632\u62a4\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the non-linear Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) for modeling the underlying energy dynamics of EEG in three representative tasks: motor imagery, emotion recognition, and epilepsy detection. To accommodate the narrowband nature of the operator, we employ Gabor filterbanks to isolate canonical frequency bands, followed by the Energy Separation Algorithm to decompose the TKEO output into amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency components. We then derive a set of energy descriptors based on this demodulation and compare their classification performance against established signal energy and power spectrum features. TKEO features outperform the respective baselines in motor imagery and epilepsy detection, whereas they perform on par in emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that the proposed TKEO-based pipeline provides an intuitive framework for extracting EEG signal dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06TKEO\u7528\u4e8eEEG\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548cEnergy Separation Algorithm(ESA)\u5c06TKEO\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u632f\u5e45\u5305\u7edc\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\u548c\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf/\u529f\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8fb9\u7f18\u52a8\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Teager-Kaiser\u80fd\u91cf\u7b97\u5b50(TKEO)\u6765\u5efa\u6a21EEG\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e26\u901a\u7684Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4ee5\u805a\u7126\u7a84\u5e26\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528ESA\u5206\u89e3\u51fa\u5305\u7edc\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5148\u7ecfGabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u82e5\u5e72\u5178\u578b\u9891\u5e26\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5e26\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e94\u7528TKEO\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u79bb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06TKEO\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u632f\u5e45\u5305\u7edc\u4e0e\u77ac\u65f6\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u7ec4\u80fd\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b\u5c06\u6240\u63d0\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u60f3\u8c61\uff08MI\uff09\u548c\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08 epilepsy\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTKEO\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTKEO\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TKEO-based\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3aEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7a84\u5e26\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u5347\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

When a tracker shuts down (whether by operator choice, technical failure, or legal action) users lose their contribution history and cannot prove their standing to new communities. We address these problems by storing reputation in smart contracts and replacing self-reports with cryptographic attestations. Receiving peers sign receipts for transferred pieces, which the tracker aggregates and verifies before updating on-chain reputation. Trackers run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee correct aggregation and prevent manipulation of state. If a tracker is unavailable, peers use an authenticated Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for discovery: the on-chain reputation acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), so peers can verify each other and maintain access control without the tracker. This design persists reputation across tracker failures and makes it portable to new instances through single-hop migration in factory-deployed contracts. We formalize the security requirements, prove correctness under standard cryptographic assumptions, and evaluate a prototype on Intel TDX. Measurements show that transfer receipts adds less than 6\\% overhead with typical piece sizes, and signature aggregation speeds up verification by $2.5\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5757\u94fe+TEE\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u7b7e\u540d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u4fe1\u8a89\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79c1\u6709BitTorrent\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u7684\u4fe1\u8a89\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5355\u70b9\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u81ea\u62a5\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u79c1\u6709 BitTorrent \u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u75db\u70b9\uff1a\u8de8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u4fe1\u8a89\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5355\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u62a5\u4fe1\u8a89\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u8a89\uff1b\u63a5\u6536\u65b9\u4e3a\u4f20\u8f93\u7684Piece\u7b7e\u540d\u6536\u636e\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u5728TEE\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u4e0a\u94fe\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u8a89\uff1b\u5728\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684DHT\u8fdb\u884c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4fe1\u8a89\u4f5c\u4e3aPKI\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5382\u90e8\u7f72\u5408\u7ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8df3\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u5728Intel TDX\u4e0a\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8de8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5668\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5728\u5931\u6548\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u7ee7\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u8bc1\u660e\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u4e8e6%\uff0c\u7b7e\u540d\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea62.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4fe1\u8a89\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging a comprehensive approximately 30-year dataset encompassing multiple renewable energy sources, our research evaluates two distinct approaches: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Non-Linear Autoregressive distributed called with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast total power generation using the solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources. The framework uses high temporal resolution and multiple parameters of the environment to improve the predictions. The fact that both the models in terms of error metrics were equally significant and had some unique tendencies at certain circumstances. The long history allows for better model calibration of temporal fluctuations and seasonal and climatic effects on power generation.

The densities for Bayesian transfer learning are approximated with the sum of weighted particles to improve the tracking performance of the primary sensor, which experiences a higher noise intensity compared to the source sensor. We present simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to an isolated particle filter and transfer learning applied to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter. Furthermore, increasing the number of particles shows an improvement in the performance of transfer learning applied to the particle filter with a higher rate compared to the isolated particle filter. However, increasing the number of particles raises computational time per step. Moreover, the performance gain from incorporating Bayesian transfer learning is approximately linearly proportional to the absolute difference value between the noise intensities of the sensors in the dual-tracking system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e3b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e3b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5927\u3001\u6e90\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u53cc\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u7c92\u5b50\u4e4b\u548c\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08UKF\uff09\u548c\u7acb\u65b9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08CKF\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u8003\u5bdf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5728\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53caUKF/CKF\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u968f\u7740\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u5927\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e5f\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u4e24\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u5448\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u6e90\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u5dee\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u542c\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u7684\u8111\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u5426\u4f34\u968f\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8111-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf936\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u7ec4\u72ec\u7acb\u7684fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u4f53\u7d20/\u7ec4\u5206\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08RSA\uff09\uff1b\u5728HEAREval\u57fa\u51c6\u76846\u9879\u542c\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5e76\u5206\u6790EnCodecMAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u542c\u89c9\u76ae\u5c42\u6d3b\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u65e7\u3001\u66f4\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08HEAREval\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u8111\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\uff0cr>0.7\uff09\uff1b\u5728EnCodecMAE\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u5df2\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\u4f46\u81ea\u7136\u800c\u7136\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8111\u6837\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd9\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u526f\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u8111\u7c7b\u4f3c\u201d\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8111-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002"}}

Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy.

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa CroTad\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u9608\u503c\u5728\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u4e0e\u70b9\u7ea7\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u8c03\u9608\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u9608\u503c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u6253\u5206\u5e76\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u70b9\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CroTad \u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u70b9\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9608\u503c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0/\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3 ITS \u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Sampson", "Peter Melchior"], "title": "A novel approach to classification of ECG arrhythmia types with latent ODEs", "comment": "Accepted into NeurIPS 2025 Learning from Time Series for Health workshop", "summary": "12-lead ECGs with high sampling frequency are the clinical gold standard for arrhythmia detection, but their short-term, spot-check nature often misses intermittent events. Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz.

Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions.

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684MTS\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6EMTC\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7IVM\u4e0eMEV\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "MTS\u805a\u7c7b\u53d7\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001/\u96f6\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5224\u522b\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u591a\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u9010\u53d8\u63a9\u7801(IVM)\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u89d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60(MEV)\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u3002IVM\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1bMEV\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u63a9\u7801\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e8\u4e2aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53474.85%\u3002", "conclusion": "EMTC\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8MTS\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations.

We find that using exact fingerprints yields a small yet consistent improvement in predictive accuracy on five molecular property prediction benchmarks from the DOCKSTRING dataset.

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e retain \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9 retain \u96c6\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u4e00\u9636 retain \u4e0d\u53d8\u79fb\u52a8\u4e2d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u9057\u5fd8-\u4fdd\u7559\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728 TOFU\u3001MUSE\u3001WMDP \u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u9762\u4e34\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u201c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u201d\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89e3\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u82e5\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u68af\u5ea6\u5f20\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u5219\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\u5728\u4e00\u9636\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08retain-invariant\uff09\u3002\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5207\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\uff0cGU \u4ec5\u6267\u884c\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u4e00\u9636 retain-invariant \u79fb\u52a8\u4e2d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u9057\u5fd8-\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u201d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728 TOFU\u3001MUSE\u3001WMDP \u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cGU \u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u8026\u5408\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u5907\u666e\u9002\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GU \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u53bb\u8026\u5408\uff08\u5207\u5411\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5411\uff09\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps.

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexiFlow\u6269\u5c55\u6d41\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u53ca\u591a\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u53ca\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6784\u8c61\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u6784\u8c61\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u53bb\u65b0/\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u914d\u4f53-\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6784\u8c61\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexiFlow\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u4e0e\u591a\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f/\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528QM9\u4e0eGEOM Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u4e14\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u6784\u8c61\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709\u9759\u6001\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u65e0\u5e94\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6784\u8c61\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u6240\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u77ed\uff1b\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u914d\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u591a\u6784\u8c61\u7684FlexiFlow\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning.

We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration.

While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "InTAct stabilizes shared representations in prompt-based continual learning to mitigate representation drift under domain shifts by constraining activation ranges of important neurons, improving domain-incremental performance without freezing parameters or storing past data.", "motivation": "Continual learning suffers from representation drift when domain shifts occur; prompts alone cannot prevent forgetting as shared layers\u2019 activations drift; need a method that preserves functional behavior without sacrificing plasticity.", "method": "InTAct preserves activation-range constraints for previously learned task representations; it monitors activation ranges of important neurons and constrains updates to keep network within those regions while allowing adaptation elsewhere; architecture-agnostic, integrates with prompt-based CL.", "result": "Across domain-incremental benchmarks (DomainNet, ImageNet-R), InTAct reduces representation drift and improves performance, achieving up to 8 percentage points higher average accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.", "conclusion": "Stabilizing the functional roles of key neurons in shared layers provides a principled stability-plasticity balance, enabling robust continual learning under domain shifts without data storage or parameter freezing."}}

Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine", "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions.
