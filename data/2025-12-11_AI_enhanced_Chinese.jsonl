To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Then a lower bound on lengths of projective $s$-minimal codes is also obtained. It is proved that $(s+1)$-minimal codes are certainly $s$-minimal codes. We generalize the Ashikhmin-Barg condition for minimal codes to $s$-minimal codes.

A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Tyche\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping\uff08MCTS-BH\uff09\u548c\u8d2a\u5a6a Beam Hopping\uff08G-BH\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u536b\u661f\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u526a\u679d\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u6b21\u5bf937\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u81f312\u79d2\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe\u7ea698.76%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u536b\u661f\uff08HTS\uff09\u5728\u5149\u675f\u8df3\u53d8\uff08beam hopping\uff09\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u6548\u7167\u660e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf937\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u9700\u8d85\u8fc7300\u79d2\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9300\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5355\u5143\u6570\u8d85\u8fc740\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Tyche \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528 MCTS-BH \u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u53f0\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728 MCTS-BH \u8ba1\u7b97\u5b8c\u6210\u524d\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u89e3\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a Beam Hopping\uff08G-BH\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a provisional \u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u572837\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u4e0a\uff0cMCTS-BH \u4ec5\u9700\u7ea612\u79d2\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cTyche \u53ef\u4f7f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe 98.76%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "Tyche \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 HTS \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 MCTS-BH \u7684\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e G-BH \u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5355\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5149\u675f\u8df3\u53d8\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u6563\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7684 ATM \u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b49\u4ef7\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u56de\u62a5\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684 mHealth \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af ATM \u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a ATM \u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9519\u914d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u5411\uff1a\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684 RL \u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\uff08mHealth\uff09\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6743\u8861\u3002\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7a00\u758f/\u5608\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u7684 Q \u5b66\u4e60\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u56e0\u800c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9 ATM \u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\uff1a\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u7684 TD\u2011Q \u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u5bf9 Q \u503c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 Action\u2011Contingent Noiselessly Observable MDP\uff08ACNO\u2011MDP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728 toy \u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u79bb\u6563\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af ATM \u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684 mHealth \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af ATM \u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8868\u660e ATM \u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u771f\u5b9e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684 RL \u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5883\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709 ATM \u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684 mHealth \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684 RL \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u3002"}}

Among numerous anti-counterfeiting techniques, leveraging inherent, unclonable microscopic irregularities of paper surfaces is an accurate and cost-effective solution. Prior work of this approach has focused on enabling ubiquitous acquisition of these physically unclonable features (PUFs). However, we will show that existing authentication methods relying on paper surface PUFs may be vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in a gap between technological feasibility and secure real-world deployment. This gap is investigated through formalizing an operational framework for paper-PUF-based authentication. Informed by this framework, we reveal system-level vulnerabilities across both physical and digital domains, designing physical denial-of-service and digital forgery attacks to disrupt proper authentication. The effectiveness of the designed attacks underscores the strong need for security countermeasures for reliable and resilient authentication based on paper PUFs. The proposed framework further facilitates a comprehensive, stage-by-stage security analysis, guiding the design of future counterfeit prevention systems. This analysis delves into potential attack strategies, offering a foundational understanding of how various system components, such as physical features and verification processes, might be exploited by adversaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7eb8\u9762\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u4eff\u5236\u7279\u5f81\uff08Paper-PUF\uff09\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u4f2a\u9020\u653b\u51fb\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9632\u4f2a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f2a\u9020\u54c1\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb8\u9762\u8868\u9762\u4e0d\u53ef\u514b\u9686\u7ec6\u5fae\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9632\u4f2a\u624b\u6bb5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u53ef\u666e\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u843d\u5730\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u7eb8-PUF\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5c42\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u7ed9\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u9632\u4f2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb8-PUF\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u7834\u574f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u7b56\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7eb8-PUF\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7eb8-PUF\u9632\u4f2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9632\u4f2a\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u63d0\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\u6f5c\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We consider the impact of these interactions on the policies drivers employ when navigating unsigned intersections in a driving simulator. The simulator allows the collection of naturalistic decision-making and behavior data in a controlled environment. Using these data, we model the human driver responses as state-based feedback controllers learned via Gaussian Process regression methods. We compute the feedback gain of the controller using a weighted combination of linear and nonlinear priors. We then analyze how the individual gains are reflected in driver behavior. We also assess differences in these controllers across populations of drivers.

In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller's FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters.

Motivated by an optimization-centric interpretation of Bayes' rule, this article addresses these challenges by proposing a new particle filtering framework that evaluates each hypothesized state using a tailored cost function, rather than relying on an explicit likelihood relation. The framework yields substantial reductions in both running time and tracking error compared to existing schemes. In addition, we examine the implementation of the proposed particle filter in MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, aiming to equip modern communication infrastructure with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities.

Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling clinician-supervised humanoid pilots.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This system enables DNA synthesizers to screen order requests against a database of hazards. By applying novel cryptography, the system aims to keep order requests and the database of hazards secret. Discerning the detailed operation of the system in part from source code (Version 1.0.8), our analysis examines key management, certificate infrastructure, authentication, and rate-limiting mechanisms. We also perform the first formal-methods analysis of the mutual authentication, basic request, and exemption-handling protocols.\n  Without breaking the cryptography, our main finding is that SecureDNA's custom mutual authentication protocol SCEP achieves only one-way authentication: the hazards database and keyservers never learn with whom they communicate. This structural weakness violates the principle of defense in depth and enables an adversary to circumvent rate limits that protect the secrecy of the hazards database, if the synthesizer connects with a malicious or corrupted keyserver or hashed database. We point out an additional structural weakness that also violates the principle of defense in depth: inadequate cryptographic bindings prevent the system from detecting if responses, within a TLS channel, from the hazards database were modified. Consequently, if a synthesizer were to reconnect with the database over the same TLS session, an adversary could replay and swap responses from the database without breaking TLS.

This manuscript develops a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that generates feasible controls for a servicer satellite to achieve zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning target satellite. The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u4f7f\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u5728\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u76ee\u6807\u536b\u661f\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u534f\u8c03\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u77e9\u52a8\u529b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8f68\u9053\u670d\u52a1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u536b\u661f\u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u65cb\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4e4b\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u8026\u5408\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u51b2\u51fb\u63a5\u89e6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u65cb\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027MPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u5176\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "MPC\u53ef\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5176\u4ed6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u81ea\u65cb\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u96f6\u51b2\u51fb\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u66f4\u7b49\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MPC\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0OOS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6\u51b2\u51fb\u63a5\u89e6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u534f\u8c03\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u8f68\u670d\u52a1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u76ee\u6807\u63a5\u89e6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a non-invasive method to collect heart activities, is used to diagnose cardiac conditions. Analyzing the ECG typically requires domain expertise, which is a roadblock to applying artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare. Through advances in self-supervised learning and foundation models, AI systems can now acquire and leverage domain knowledge without relying solely on human expertise. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses over the foundation models' performance on ECG. This study aims to answer the research question: \"Are Foundation Models Useful for ECG Analysis?\" To address it, we evaluate language/general time-series/ECG foundation models in comparison with time-series deep learning models. The experimental results show that general time-series/ECG foundation models achieve a top performance rate of 80%, indicating their effectiveness in ECG analysis.

We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7535\u5f27\u7089(EAF)\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7535\u4ef7\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5MILP\u5f62\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5229\u7528Q\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5355\u5143EAF\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5728NY\u5dde\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c4\u5219\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684MILP\u57fa\u51c6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cRL\u4ec5\u9700\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea690%\u5229\u6da6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3EAF\u5728\u7535\u4ef7\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfMILP\u5728\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u540e\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e14\u5177\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027EAF\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aMILP\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u5355\u5143EAF\u7684Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u8d77\u52a8\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1b\u4ee5\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c4\u5219\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4ef7\u683c\u7684MILP\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u5355\u5143\u548c\u5355\u5355\u5143\u573a\u666f\u7684\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u6da6\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8c\u7f8eMILP\u57fa\u51c6\u7ea690%\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9EAF\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18MILP\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u5171\u4eab\u5582\u7ed9\u5bb9\u91cf\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e24\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u76f8\u63a7\u9635\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u65b9\u5411SER\u4f4e\u3001\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u53ef\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u805a\u7126\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u672a\u6388\u6743\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4e24\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u5143\u7d20\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u76f8\u63a7\u9635\uff1b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u53d1\u9001\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u4e24\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5904\u76f8\u5e72\u53e0\u52a0\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u7b26\u53f7\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5c06\u80fd\u91cf\u805a\u7126\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u572850\u03bb\u9635\u5217\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u9891\u73873 GHz\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9519\u8bef\u7387SER\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u9001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4eSER\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u5916SER\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e7f\u4fa7\uff08broadside\uff09SER\u4e3a0.0082\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4d\u7f6eSER>0.25\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6eSER\u4e3a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u76f8\u63a7\u9635\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e72\u805a\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6570\u636e\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5728\u6291\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite these advantages, the coexistence of near-field and far-field effects in hybrid-field channels presents significant challenges for accurate estimation, where traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.\n  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency.

In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data.\n  In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ObliInjection\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6e90\u6bb5\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u90e8\u5206\u6e90\u4e14\u4e0d\u77e5\u6bb5\u843d\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6e90\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u6b64\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 order-oblivious loss \u6765\u8861\u91cf\u65e0\u8bba\u6bb5\u843d\u987a\u5e8f\u5982\u4f55\u90fd\u503e\u5411\u5b8c\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa orderGCG \u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6c61\u67d3\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5f53\u4ec5\u6709 1/6 \u5230 1/100 \u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6e90\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u4e0a\u884cPinching-antenna\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237OFDM\u8054\u5408\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528CP\u5c06\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u6563\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9891\u57df\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "PASS\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u91cd\u6784\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u9053\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u65f6\u5ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u7528\u6237OFDM\u4e0a\u884cPASS\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ee5\u671f\u671b\u4f20\u64ad\uff08EP\uff09\u51cf\u5c0f\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u5339\u914d\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08OMP\uff09\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f20\u64ad-\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\uff08BP-VI\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u8def\u5f84\u65f6\u5ef6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u901a\u9053\u77e9\u9635\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9EP\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83CRLB\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u63a5\u8fd1CRLB\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eRF\u94fe\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002"}}

This enables instance-level interpretability, suppresses noisy or mislabeled samples, and reduces hyperparameter sensitivity.\n  Comprehensive evaluation on 9 data-sets helps to demonstrate that DW-KNN achieves 0.8988 accuracy on average.

The source-IRS and IRS-destination links are subject to various challenges, including atmospheric attenuation, asymmetric $\u03b1$-$\u03bc$ distributed small-scale fading, and beam misalignment-induced pointing errors. The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $\u03b1$-$\u03bc$ fading channels. Furthermore, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP), average channel capacity (ACC), and average symbol error rate (ASER) for rectangular QAM (RQAM) and hexagonal QAM (HQAM) schemes over the end-to-end (e2e) link. The impact of random co-phasing and phase quantization errors are also examined. In addition to the theoretical analysis, deep neural network-based frameworks are developed to predict key performance metrics, facilitating fast and accurate system evaluation without computationally intensive analytical computations. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime yields closed-form expressions for coding gain and diversity order, providing further insights into performance trends. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical formulations and present a comprehensive assessment of system behavior under practical conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aIRS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684THz\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u94fe\u8def\u7684OP\u3001ACC\u3001ASER\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u77e9\u5f62QAM\u548c\u516d\u89d2QAM\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Laguerre\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\u5bf9IRS\u4fe1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6e90\u7aef-IRS\u4e0eIRS-\u76ee\u7684\u7aef\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u03b1-\u03bc\u8870\u843d\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8SNR\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\uff08THz\uff09\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u6613\u53d7\u5f3a\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5bf9\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cIRS\u53ef\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u6e90\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5bf9IRS\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5c06IRS\u4fe1\u9053\u7528Laguerre\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u6e90\u7aef-IRS\u4e0eIRS-\u76ee\u7684\u7aef\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u03b1-\u03bc\u8870\u843d\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684OP\u3001ACC\u3001ASER\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u77e9\u5f62QAM\u4e0e\u516d\u89d2QAM\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u76f8\u4f4d\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8SNR\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7f16\u7801\u589e\u76ca\u4e0e\u5206\u96c6\u9636\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u95ed\u5f0fOP\u3001ACC\u3001ASER\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8986\u76d6RQAM\u548cHQAM\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8SNR\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5206\u96c6\u9636\u6570\uff1b\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DNN\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aIRS\u8f85\u52a9THz\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6574\u5957\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8SNR\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering. This is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise and therefore not scalable. We present LUMOS (Large User MOdel Series), a transformer-based architecture that eliminates task-specific models and manual feature engineering by learning multiple tasks jointly using only raw user activity data. LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behaviour patterns like \"how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?\" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user transactions, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways.\n  Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 275 billion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks.

PoW anchors security in heavy computation, inflating energy use and imposing high confirmation latency. PoS improves efficiency but introduces stake concentration, long-range and \"nothing-at-stake\" vulnerabilities, and a hard performance ceiling shaped by slot times and multi-round committee voting. In this paper, we propose Proof of Trusted Execution (PoTE), a consensus paradigm where agreement emerges from verifiable execution rather than replicated re-execution. Validators operate inside heterogeneous VM-based TEEs, each running the same canonical program whose measurement is publicly recorded, and each producing vendor-backed attestations that bind the enclave code hash to the block contents. Because the execution is deterministic and the proposer is uniquely derived from public randomness, PoTE avoids forks, eliminates slot.time bottlenecks, and commits blocks in a single round of verification.

However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u514b\u5e03\u52d2\u89d2\u5ea6\u56fe(CLAM)\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6742\u6ce2\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408OFDM ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7CLAM\u5efa\u7acb\u533a\u57df\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6742\u6ce2\u89d2\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u524d\u6291\u5236\u6742\u6ce2\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6b65\u5f0fCLAM\u5728\u65f6\u57df-\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6162\u901f\u4f4e\u7a7aUAV\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\uff08\u57ce\u5e02/\u5c71\u533a\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6742\u6ce2\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u76ee\u6807\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5dee\u5206\u6216\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6742\u6ce2\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u533a\u57df\u6027\u3001\u573a\u666f\u9002\u914d\u7684\u6742\u6ce2\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u50cf/\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CLAM\uff08\u6742\u6ce2\u89d2\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u6027\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6742\u6ce2\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u8986\u76d6\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6742\u6ce2\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002\u5229\u7528CLAM\u5728\u611f\u6d4b\u524d\u5bf9\u6742\u6ce2\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6291\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6742\u6ce2\u65b9\u5411\u63a5\u8fd1\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u6b65\u5f0fCLAM\u8054\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u57df\u6742\u6ce2\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u6742\u6ce2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6162\u901f\u4f4e\u7a7aUAV\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCLAM\u7684\u6742\u6ce2\u6291\u5236\u4e3aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u6027\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e-altitude\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6162\u901f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6742\u6ce2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The benchmark spans 11 well-defined diagnostic tasks across 14 publicly available EEG datasets, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, OCD, and mild traumatic brain injury.

Recent studies have revealed that recommender systems are prone to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an attacker aims to infer whether or not a user's data has been used for training a target recommender system. However, existing MIAs fail to exploit the unique characteristic of recommender systems, and therefore are only applicable to mixed recommender systems consisting of two recommendation algorithms. This leaves a gap in investigating MIAs against hybrid-based recommender systems where the same algorithm utilizing user-item historical interactions and attributes of users and items serves and produces personalised recommendations. To investigate how the personalisation in hybrid-based recommender systems influences MIA, we propose a novel metric-based MIA. Specifically, we leverage the characteristic of personalisation to obtain reference recommendation for any target users. Then, a relative membership metric is proposed to exploit a target user's historical interactions, target recommendation, and reference recommendation to infer the membership of the target user's data. Finally, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed metric-based MIA on hybrid-based recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u63a8\u8350\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MIAs\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ee5\u540c\u4e00\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u8d44\u683c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u7f3a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08relative membership metric\uff09\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u8def\u662f\uff1a1) \u4f9d\u636e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u8350\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u5f97\u5206\uff1b3) \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684MIAs\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709MIAs\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5224\u65ad\u76ee\u6807\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5426\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ea6\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684MIA\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u578b\uff08\u540c\u4e00\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u6210\u5458\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9632\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Most existing structure-based attacks rely on gradient-based heuristics or local connectivity patterns, and treat edges as equally important candidates for manipulation. In this paper, we propose Spectral Edge Attacks (SEA), a new family of adversarial attacks that explicitly leverage spectral robustness evaluation to guide structural perturbations. Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space.

Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "PA\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9OFDM ISAC\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e0a\u9650\uff0cPSK\u4e0eQAM\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0b\u5747\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u5931\u771f\u626d\u66f2\u91cd\u5851AF\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u529f\u7387\u653e\u5927\u5668\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u7efc\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1(ISAC)\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e38\u6a21PSK\u4e0e\u6052\u6a21QAM\u5728OFDM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684S&C\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8PAPR\u5bf9\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u5931\u771f\u6bd4SDR\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8f90\u5c04/\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9AF\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u5728\u96f6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u65c1\u74e3\u548c\u96f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65c1\u74e3\u5904\u7684\u5931\u771f\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "PA\u5931\u771f\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8c03\u5236\u4e0b\u5747\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u626d\u66f2\u91cd\u5851AF\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u5355\u5cf0/\u7edf\u4e00\u5e45\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7fOFDM\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5305\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5728ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u628aPA\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53caPAPR\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7eb3\u5165\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u91c7\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u8c03\u5236/\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5931\u771f\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We introduce FIFE, a novel, high-difficulty benchmark designed to assess LM instruction-following capabilities for financial analysis tasks. FIFE comprises 88 human-authored prompts and employs a verification system with chainable, verifiable constraints for fine-grained reward signals. We evaluate 53 models (proprietary, open-weight, open-source) in a zero-shot setting.

These pitfalls span the entire computation process, from data collection, pre-training, and fine-tuning to prompting and evaluation.\n  We assess the prevalence of these pitfalls across all 72 peer-reviewed papers published at leading Security and Software Engineering venues between 2023 and 2024. We find that every paper contains at least one pitfall, and each pitfall appears in multiple papers. Yet only 15.7\\% of the present pitfalls were explicitly discussed, suggesting that the majority remain unrecognized.

This paper presents a real-time feasible non-smooth model predictive control scheme for a physical three-tank process, implemented without mixed-integer formulations. The approach combines Filippov system modeling with finite elements and switch detection for time discretization, leading to a finite-dimensional optimal control problem formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. The mathematical program is solved via a homotopy of smooth nonlinear programs. We introduce modeling adjustments that make the three-tank dynamics numerically tractable, including additional modes to avoid non-Lipschitz points and undefined function values. Hardware experiments demonstrate efficient handling of switching events, mode-consistent tracking across reference changes, correct boundary handling, and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of model mismatch and show that the tracking performance and computation times remain within real-time limits for the chosen sampling time.

Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u7ee7\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u5408\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u5f0f\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u3001SN\u5206\u7ec4\u3001\u4e2d\u7ee7\u9009\u62e9\u4e0eSPCA\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u81f3ICSI\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65f6\u5ef6\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u6548\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8SN\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u4f20\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u8f6c\u53d1\u7684\u4e2d\u7ee7\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u4e2d\u7ee7\u5728\u8f6c\u53d1\u524d\u6267\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u8df3/\u4e24\u8df3\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u7ee7\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316EE\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528SPCA\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8054\u5408\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u8f6e\u6b21\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684SN\u6570\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5355\u8df3\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684 outage\u4ece10^-2\u964d\u81f310^-6\uff1b\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\uff0cSPCA\u76f8\u8f83\u672a\u805a\u5408\u5408\u4f5c\u81f3\u5c11\u8282\u77012\u500d\u3001\u76f8\u8f83\u5355\u8df3\u6700\u9ad8\u8282\u77016\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u7ee7\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u805a\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728IIoT\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684FL\uff0cSPCA\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177\uff0cICSI\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer program are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation techniques.

Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u6027\u9635\u5217\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u636e\u53ef\u67e5\u7684GLRT\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u786e\u8ba4\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u63a5\u6536\u9635\u5217\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5728Lp\u8303\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9DL\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u79cdLp\u754c\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9635\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eDoA\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u5177\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u800cGLRT\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6298\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u731c\u6d4b\u6027\u9635\u5217\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684DL\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684GLRT\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5bf9DL\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u63a5\u6536\u9635\u5217\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff08\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7b49\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aGLRT\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5bf9Lp\u8303\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9DL\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdLp\u754c\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdLp bounds\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u731c\u6d4b\u6027\u9635\u5217\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b/DoA\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9635\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e3aDL\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.\n  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms.

This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses.

The framework faces critical challenges in motor rehabilitation due to accessibility, cost, and continuity of care, with over 50% of patients inability to attend regular clinic sessions. The system enables post-stroke patients to undergo personalized therapy in immersive virtual reality at home, while being monitored by clinicians. The core is a nonlinear, human-in-the-loop control strategy, where the avatar adapts in real time to the patient's performance.

In response, the research community has proposed defenses based on randomized and (de)randomized smoothing. However, these techniques remain susceptible to attacks that insert large adversarial payloads. To address these limitations, we propose a novel defense mechanism designed to harden end-to-end malware detectors by leveraging masking at the byte level. This mechanism operates by generating multiple masked versions of the input file, independently classifying each version, and then applying a threshold-based voting mechanism to produce the final classification. Key to this defense is a deterministic masking strategy that systematically strides a mask across the entire input file. Unlike randomized smoothing defenses, which randomly mask or delete bytes, this structured approach ensures coverage of the file over successive versions. In the best-case scenario, this strategy fully occludes the adversarial payload, effectively neutralizing its influence on the model's decision. In the worst-case scenario, it partially occludes the adversarial payload, reducing its impact on the model's predictions. By occluding the adversarial payload in one or more masked versions, this defense ensures that some input versions remain representative of the file's original intent, allowing the voting mechanism to suppress the influence of the adversarial payload. Results achieved on the EMBER and BODMAS datasets demonstrate the suitability of our defense, outperforming randomized and (de)randomized smoothing defenses against adversarial examples generated with a wide range of functionality-preserving manipulations while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u906e\u853d\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7248\u672c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u9608\u503c\u6295\u7968\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728 EMBER \u4e0e BODMAS \u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5316/\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u5316\u548c\u53bb/\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f7d\u8377\u4ecd\u6709\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u6297\u8f7d\u8377\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b57\u8282\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u4ef6\u6309\u6b65\u957f\u6ed1\u52a8\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u906e\u853d\u7248\u672c\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u9608\u503c\u6295\u7968\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u5224\u5b9a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8986\u76d6\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u853d\u5bf9\u6297\u8f7d\u8377\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u90e8\u5206\u7248\u672c\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u610f\u56fe\u4ee5\u4f9b\u6295\u7968\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u6297\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728 EMBER \u4e0e BODMAS \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u906e\u853d\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5316\u4e0e(\u53bb)\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5e73\u6ed1\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7ef4\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8f7d\u8377\u8fdb\u884c\u906e\u853d\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making.

Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history.

Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants.

While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths.

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEDONet uses a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary as the trunk input to DeepONet, replacing coordinate-based MLP trunks to better capture non-periodic, bounded-domain features.

Multiple transcatheter heart valves (THV) have been approved for use in TAVR, but current guidelines regarding valve type prescription remain an active topic of debate. We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates. The final prescriptive model shows a reduction in PPI rates of 26% and 16% compared with the current standard of care in our internal U.S. population and external Greek validation cohort, respectively.

However, their reliability and robustness in real-world engineering domains remain largely unexplored, limiting their practical utility in human-centric workflows. In this work, we investigate the applicability and consistency of LLMs for analog circuit design -- a task requiring domain-specific reasoning, adherence to physical constraints, and structured representations -- focusing on AI-assisted design where humans remain in the loop.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds.

Accepted at MCSoC 2025", "summary": "The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points.

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family.

While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Node-anchored Subgraph GNNs with expressive power below 3-WL can approximate Strong Branching scores, but practical costs are high; current methods favor MPNNs/heuristics; need efficiency-preserving expressivity.", "motivation": "Investigate the expressivity-efficiency trade-off for GNN-based MILP branching to bridge theory and practice.", "method": "Theoretical proof showing node-anchored Subgraph GNNs with expressivity strictly below 3-WL can approximate Strong Branching scores; comprehensive empirical evaluation on four MILP benchmarks comparing against MPNNs and heuristics.", "result": "Theoretically, subgraph GNNs with sub-3-WL expressivity suffice to approximate Strong Branching scores.

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions. Beyond MPI prediction, our approach provides a new paradigm for leveraging diverse biological data sources to tackle problems traditionally constrained by single- or bi-modal learning, paving the way for future advances in computational biology and drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u548c\u901a\u8def\u7b49\u591a\u6e90\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MPI\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u96f6-shot\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "MPI\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5206\u5b50/\u86cb\u767d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u3001\u4ee3\u8c22\u901a\u8def\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u5408\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u548c\u901a\u8def\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MPI\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMPI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u96f6-shot\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u751f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

Single-Call LLM Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability.

It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead.

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Cauchy\u2013Schwarz \u53d1\u6563\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CS \u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u5236\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u63a7\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u9002\u7528\u6027\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CS \u516c\u5e73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c CS \u53d1\u6563\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b CS \u53d1\u6563\u7684\u754c\u9650\u6bd4 KL\u3001MMD\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e Demographic Parity \u7684\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9 Demographic Parity \u548c Equal Opportunity \u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u516c\u5e73-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u90e8\u5206\uff0cCS \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 Demographic Parity \u4e0e Equal Opportunity \u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCS \u6b63\u5219\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u826f\u597d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6298\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "CS \u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5bf9\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We develop a contextual pricing algorithm based on optimistic posterior sampling with regret $\\widetilde{O}(K_{\\star}\\sqrt{dT})$, which we prove to be tight in $d$ and $T$ up to logarithmic terms. Finally, we refine our analysis for the non-contextual pricing case, proposing a variance-aware zooming algorithm that achieves the optimal dependence on $K_{\\star}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction.

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training.

Current data-driven methods are generally applied within specific domains, such as design or manufacturing, with limited exploration of integrating design features and manufacturing process data. Since design decisions significantly affect manufacturing outcomes, such as error rates, energy consumption, and processing times, the lack of such integration restricts the potential for data-driven product design improvements. This paper presents a data-driven approach to mapping and analyzing the relationship between design features and manufacturing process data.

This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{DivMorph}, a modular training paradigm that leverages knowledge diversion to learn decomposable controllers.

In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain.

In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models.

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 kNN \u548c epsilon-neighborhood \u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7b5b\u9009\u9636\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u52a8\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u9020\u56fe\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u56fe\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5e73 kNN \u548c\u516c\u5e73 epsilon-neighborhood \u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u6784\u56fe\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5236\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u7b49\uff08demographic parity\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5404\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u4e2d\u6309\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5f97\u5230\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e03\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u3002"}}

These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u91ce\u706b\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u3001LSTM\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728FRAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aXGBoost\u5728\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u6700\u4f73\uff0cLSTM\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u8513\u5ef6\uff0c\u8f83\u5c11\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4efdFRAP\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u96c6\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLSTM\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "XGBoost\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1bLSTM\u8868\u73b0 inferior\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91ce\u706b\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e94\u6025\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Conformal Bandits \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06 Conformal Prediction \u878d\u5408\u8fdb bandit \u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e regret \u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a/\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982 Thompson Sampling\u3001UCB\uff09\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u60c5\u5f62\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 Conformal Prediction \u878d\u5165 bandit \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e regret\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u85cf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5e02\u573a\u7684 regime-switching\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u5c55\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f-gap \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u5177\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178 UCB\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Conformal Bandits \u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 regret \u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u7684 regime-switching\uff09\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8986\u76d6\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5bf9\u6570\u8f93\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f4d\u79e9\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1a\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4e0d\u540c token \u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u63a7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e API \u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u8f93\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u5bf9\u6570\u8f93\u51fa(query)\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u201c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f4d\u79e9\u201d\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u5bf9\u6570\u8f93\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u79e9\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u610f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f4d\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4/\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5bf9\u63a5\u8fd1\u73b0\u4ee3 LMs \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a plausibly \u6355\u6349\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f4d\u79e9\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Boltzmann Generators tackle this problem by pairing a generative model, capable of exact likelihood computation, with importance sampling to obtain consistent samples under the target distribution. Current Boltzmann Generators primarily use continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) trained with flow matching for efficient training of powerful models. However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility. We show FALCON outperforms state-of-the-art normalizing flow models for molecular Boltzmann sampling and is two orders of magnitude faster than the equivalently performing CNF model.", "AI": {"tldr": "FALCON \u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5b50 Boltzmann \u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5904\u4e8e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u62bd\u6837\u4e00\u76f4\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6b63\u5219\u5206\u5e03\u6d41(CNF)\u7684 Boltzmann Generators \u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa FALCON\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5b50 Boltzmann \u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "FALCON \u5728\u5206\u5b50 Boltzmann \u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709 CNF \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff08\u7ea6100\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 Boltzmann \u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c11\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models. At test time, our approach outperforms or matches the classical gradient-free cross-entropy method (CEM) across a variety of object manipulation and navigation tasks in 10% of the time budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u4e0b\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aCEM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e00\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9700\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u4e3a\u5f25\u5408\u6b64train-test gap\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68af\u5ea6\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u68af\u5ea6-free\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5CEM\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5\u4ec510%\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u8fbe\u5230\u8be5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
