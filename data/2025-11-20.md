TL;DR: Open-source models can approach proprietary models in security incident classification, offering privacy, cost, and data-sovereignty advantages despite some accuracy gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether open-source, locally deployed models can match or approach the performance of proprietary models in security incident classification while highlighting trade-offs in privacy, cost, and data governance.

Method: Evaluate open-source vs proprietary models on a dataset of anonymized real security incidents labeled per NIST SP 800-61r3 taxonomy, using five prompt-engineering techniques (PHP, SHP, HTP, PRP, ZSL) to elicit model performance.

Result: Proprietary models retain higher accuracy, but open-source, locally deployed models offer clear benefits in privacy, cost savings, and data sovereignty; the gap in performance may be acceptable depending on deployment and governance requirements.

Conclusion: Open-source models are viable alternatives for security incident classification when privacy, cost, and data-control are priorities, though organizations must weigh potential accuracy trade-offs against governance needs and risk tolerance.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate open-source models for security incident classification, comparing them with proprietary models. We utilize a dataset of anonymized real incidents, categorized according to the NIST SP 800-61r3 taxonomy and processed using five prompt-engineering techniques (PHP, SHP, HTP, PRP, and ZSL). The results indicate that, although proprietary models still exhibit higher accuracy, locally deployed open-source models provide advantages in privacy, cost-effectiveness, and data sovereignty.

### [2] [CIMemories: A Compositional Benchmark for Contextual Integrity of Persistent Memory in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14937)
*Niloofar Mireshghallah,Neal Mangaokar,Narine Kokhlikyan,Arman Zharmagambetov,Manzil Zaheer,Saeed Mahloujifar,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CIMemories评估表明LLMs在持久记忆中信息流控制方面存在显著泄露风险，属性级泄露可达69%；提示改进不足，需上下文感知的推理能力来合理控制记忆信息的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越依赖历史交互中的持久记忆来实现个性化和任务性能提升，若未能在上下文中正确控制信息流，敏感信息可能被错误披露，因此需要一个系统化的基准来评估模型在不同任务上下文下对记忆信息的控制能力。

Method: 构建CIMemories基准：使用包含每位用户100+属性的合成用户画像，以及在每个任务情境中对某些属性的必要性与不当性之间的对比，评估边界模型在任务上下文中信息流的控制。通过多任务多轮（1到40任务、同一提示重复N次）评估属性级泄露率，记录随任务与重复次数的泄露趋势。

Result: 在前沿模型中存在高达69%的属性级泄露，且降低泄露率往往以牺牲任务效用为代价。泄露在任务与运行中累积：随着任务数从1增至40，GPT-5的泄露率从0.1%升至9.6%，同一提示重复5次时达到25.1%。模型表现出任意且不稳定的行为，对相同提示泄露不同属性。隐私友好提示无效，模型要么“全泄露”要么“全不泄露”。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了需要上下文感知的推理能力来合理管理记忆信息流；仅靠提示优化或模型规模扩展不足以解决问题，需要从模型架构、训练目标或信息流控制机制等方面进行改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly use persistent memory from past interactions to enhance personalization and task performance. However, this memory introduces critical risks when sensitive information is revealed in inappropriate contexts. We present CIMemories, a benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs appropriately control information flow from memory based on task context. CIMemories uses synthetic user profiles with over 100 attributes per user, paired with diverse task contexts in which each attribute may be essential for some tasks but inappropriate for others. Our evaluation reveals that frontier models exhibit up to 69% attribute-level violations (leaking information inappropriately), with lower violation rates often coming at the cost of task utility. Violations accumulate across both tasks and runs: as usage increases from 1 to 40 tasks, GPT-5's violations rise from 0.1% to 9.6%, reaching 25.1% when the same prompt is executed 5 times, revealing arbitrary and unstable behavior in which models leak different attributes for identical prompts. Privacy-conscious prompting does not solve this - models overgeneralize, sharing everything or nothing rather than making nuanced, context-dependent decisions. These findings reveal fundamental limitations that require contextually aware reasoning capabilities, not just better prompting or scaling.

### [3] [LFreeDA: Label-Free Drift Adaptation for Windows Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14963)
*Adrian Shuai Li,Elisa Bertino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出LFreeDA，一种端到端的无标注漂移自适应框架，结合无监督域适应与CFG表示，无需人工标注即可提升恶意软件检测鲁棒性，接近完全监督水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件检测容易因概念漂移而性能下降，标注与沙箱分析成本高，现有方法多依赖漂移检测与部分标注，缺乏完全无标注的自适应方案，需要充分挖掘未标注数据的信息。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段对恶意软件图像进行无监督域自适应，联合有标注与无标注样本，推断伪标签并去噪；第二阶段在CFG表示上以有标注数据和筛选后的伪标签对分类器进行自适应训练，融合图像级伪标签的可扩展性与CFG的丰富语义。

Result: 在MB-24+数据集上，相较无适应基线，准确率提升最高12.6%，F1提升11.1%；接近有监督上限，准确率仅比上限低4%，F1低3.4%；对300目标样本的有监督方法表现一致；在两组受控漂移基准测试中也证实在无标签情形下维持较好检测性能。

Conclusion: 证明了无标注漂移自适应的可行性与有效性，通过同时利用图像伪标签和CFG语义进行端到端自适应，显著缩小与有监督方法的差距并提高对抗漂移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based malware detectors degrade over time as concept drift introduces new and evolving families unseen during training. Retraining is limited by the cost and time of manual labeling or sandbox analysis. Existing approaches mitigate this via drift detection and selective labeling, but fully label-free adaptation remains largely unexplored. Recent self-training methods use a previously trained model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then train a new model on these labels. The unlabeled data are used only for inference and do not participate in training the earlier model. We argue that these unlabeled samples still carry valuable information that can be leveraged when incorporated appropriately into training. This paper introduces LFreeDA, an end-to-end framework that adapts malware classifiers to drift without manual labeling or drift detection. LFreeDA first performs unsupervised domain adaptation on malware images, jointly training on labeled and unlabeled samples to infer pseudo-labels and prune noisy ones. It then adapts a classifier on CFG representations using the labeled and selected pseudo-labeled data, leveraging the scalability of images for pseudo-labeling and the richer semantics of CFGs for final adaptation. Evaluations on the real-world MB-24+ dataset show that LFreeDA improves accuracy by up to 12.6% and F1 by 11.1% over no-adaptation lower bounds, and is only 4% and 3.4% below fully supervised upper bounds in accuracy and F1, respectively. It also matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods provided with ground truth labels for 300 target samples. Additional results on two controlled-drift benchmarks further confirm that LFreeDA maintains malware detection performance as malware evolves without human labeling.

### [4] [Towards Classifying Benign And Malicious Packages Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15033)
*Thanh-Cong Nguyen,Ngoc-Thanh Nguyen,Van-Giau Ung,Duc-Ly Vu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 利用动态分析特征和机器学习对 npm 包进行恶意检测，取得较高性能；AUC 0.91，FPR 接近0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全扫描多聚焦已知 CVE，缺乏对恶意包的自动检测方法。动态分析可揭示运行时行为，但现有工具缺乏自动化的恶意/良性区分方法。

Method: 从动态分析中提取特征（如实际执行的命令、运行行为等），训练机器学习分类器以区分善意与恶意包；在近2000个 npm 包上进行评估。

Result: 所训练的分类器在评估中达到 AUC 0.91，假阳性率接近0%。

Conclusion: 动态分析结合机器学习在恶意开源包检测中具有潜力，但需关注可扩展性、泛化性及阈值依赖等局限。

Abstract: Recently, the number of malicious open-source packages in package repositories has been increasing dramatically. While major security scanners focus on identifying known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in open-source packages, there are very few studies on detecting malicious packages. Malicious open-source package detection typically requires static, dynamic analysis, or both. Dynamic analysis is more effective as it can expose a package's behaviors at runtime. However, current dynamic analysis tools (e.g., ossf's package-analysis) lack an automatic method to differentiate malicious packages from benign packages. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract the features from dynamic analysis (e.g., executed commands) and leverage machine learning techniques to automatically classify packages as benign or malicious. Our evaluation of nearly 2000 packages on npm shows that the machine learning classifier achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a false positive rate of nearly 0%.

### [5] [Towards Practical Zero-Knowledge Proof for PSPACE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15071)
*Ashwin Karthikeyan,Hengyu Liu,Kuldeep S. Meel,Ning Luo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 首次给出可在PSPACE内实现的零知识协议，用于QBF求值的证明验证，核心是对Q-Res证明的高效多项式编码及知晓策略的ZK协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将零知识证明从NP扩展到PSPACE，解决QBF等PSPACE-complete问题的隐私验证需求，提升实际可用性。

Method: 提出Q-Res证明的多项式编码以便在ZK中进行低开销算术验证，同时设计证明对QBF‘知晓胜利策略’的ZK协议，配合实现与评估。

Result: 在QBFEVAL上实现并评估：对72%的QBF评估可通过Q-Res证明验证，对82%的实例的胜利策略在100秒内可验证（前提是存在相应证明或策略）。

Conclusion: 首次展示将可在PSPACE的QBF问题上实现实用ZK协议的可行性，证明与策略证明具有实际应用潜力，但结果受限于可获得的证明/策略实例。

Abstract: Efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been restricted to NP statements so far, whereas they exist for all statements in PSPACE. This work presents the first practical zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols for PSPACE-complete statements by enabling ZK proofs of QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) evaluation. The core idea is to validate quantified resolution proofs (Q-Res) in ZK. We develop an efficient polynomial encoding of Q-Res proofs, enabling proof validation through low-overhead arithmetic checks. We also design a ZK protocol to prove knowledge of a winning strategy related to the QBF, which is often equally important in practice. We implement our protocols and evaluate them on QBFEVAL. The results show that our protocols can verify 72% of QBF evaluations via Q-Res proof and 82% of instances' winning strategies within 100 seconds, for instances where such proofs or strategies can be obtained.

*Jingzhuo Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdapT-Bench 提出一个面向学术环境的统一框架与基准，评估多模态大语言模型在动态钓鱼攻击中的防御能力，聚焦学术背景信息与跨语言情境因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术机构和研究人员是高价值目标，攻击常利用研究背景、学术协作关系和个人信息进行定制化；现有安全基准缺乏对学术背景信息的覆盖，难以捕捉学术场景中的攻击模式和人因脆弱性。

Method: 提出一个统一的方法论框架与基准套件，用于系统性评估 MLLM 在学术环境中对动态钓鱼攻击的防御能力，结合学术场景的多模态输入、跨语言与情境依赖性。

Result: 摘要未给出具体实验结果，重点在框架与基准的构建与提出，为后续评估提供平台。

Conclusion: AdapT-Bench 为学术环境的动态钓鱼防御研究提供统一评测工具，有助于提升对学术相关攻击的理解与防御能力。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced unprecedented security challenges, particularly in phishing detection within academic environments. Academic institutions and researchers are high-value targets, facing dynamic, multilingual, and context-dependent threats that leverage research backgrounds, academic collaborations, and personal information to craft highly tailored attacks. Existing security benchmarks largely rely on datasets that do not incorporate specific academic background information, making them inadequate for capturing the evolving attack patterns and human-centric vulnerability factors specific to academia. To address this gap, we present AdapT-Bench, a unified methodological framework and benchmark suite for systematically evaluating MLLM defense capabilities against dynamic phishing attacks in academic settings.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次对以IPI为中心的防御框架进行系统性知识梳理（SoK），提出五维分类法，对代表性框架进行安全性与可用性评估，揭示六大防御规避根因，并设计三种自适应攻击以刻画框架缺陷，旨在为未来的更安全且可用的IPI防御框架提供基础与洞见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大型语言模型的智能体在函数调用场景中广泛应用，其易受间接指令注入（IPI）攻击的风险显现。现有防御框架碎片化、缺乏统一分类与全面评估，亟需系统化整理以提升安全性与可用性。

Method: 提出一个覆盖五个维度的全面分类法，对代表性IPI防御框架进行深度评估（安全性与可用性），从评估中提炼出框架在实现防御过程中的不足；基于评估结果分析出六个防御规避的根本原因，进而设计三种新颖的自适应攻击来验证并放大这些缺陷。

Result: 给出统一的分类框架、定量与定性评估结果、六个防御规避根因的系统化总结，以及三种自适应攻击对框架脆弱性的显著提升，确立对未来防御研究的基础与方向。

Conclusion: 提供对IPI中心防御框架的系统化理解与关键洞见，促使后续研究在安全性与可用性之间实现更平衡的、可落地的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with function-calling capabilities are increasingly deployed, but remain vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks that hijack their tool calls. In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses. Our paper provides a foundation and critical insights for the future development of more secure and usable IPI-centric agent defense frameworks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 通过评估1B-70B参数的15个小型语言模型在仅使用原始HTML的钓鱼网站检测上的性能，比较成本与资源消耗，揭示SLM在本地部署下作为外部LLM替代的可行性及权衡。

Abstract: Phishing websites pose a major cybersecurity threat, exploiting unsuspecting users and causing significant financial and organisational harm. Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.

### [9] [How To Cook The Fragmented Rug Pull?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15463)
*Minh Trung Tran,Nasrin Sohrabi,Zahir Tari,Qin Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出 fragment rug pull (FRP) 概念，建立三组原子谓词并通过正交组合描述分散、低可见度的提取策略；在大规模链上数据上验证其普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Rug-pull 检测多基于单次大额出售的假设，无法捕捉跨时间与多账户协同的慢速分散攻击；需要更灵活的框架以提升检测覆盖。

Method: 提出 FRP 分类框架，将攻击分解为三组原子谓词及其正交组合；在 303,614 个 LP、105,434 FRP 标注、34,192,767 pool-related transactions、401,838 inflated-seller wallets、涉及 1,501,408 个唯一互动地址的大规模数据上进行标注与实证分析，分析其组合对检测盲点的影响。

Result: 揭示 evasive 策略广泛存在；FRP 标记 LP 中 owner-wallet 参与下降（33.1% 的情况），盗取行为从 owner 钱包转移，检测难度提升；发现 127,252 个钱包在多个 FRP LPs 中作为串联诈骗者重复进行出售。

Conclusion: FRP 框架揭示了现有检测方法的局限性，提供了一组可操作的检测与研究方向，以应对分散、跨时间与跨地址的慢速 rug pull；未来需开发更强的防御机制与普遍适用的检测模型。

Abstract: Existing rug pull detectors assume a simple workflow: the deployer keeps liquidity pool (LP) tokens and performs one or a few large sells (within a day) that collapse the pool and cash out. In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.
  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).
  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.
  Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.

### [11] [Channel Coding for Gaussian Channels with Multifaceted Power Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14849)
*Adeel Mahmood,Aaron B. Wagner*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种多方面功率约束模型，能够描述对平均功率及其更细粒度统计的依赖，并给出高斯信道下最小平均错误概率在一阶和二阶编码速率下的精确表述；对对偶分析使用Prokhorov度量的紧致集、极点与Bauer极大原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受基于正态近似的更精细渐进结果的启发，研究平均功率Γ及输入功率的更细统计如何影响更高阶的编码性能。

Method: 提出一个多方面功率模型，在归一化平均功率的任意函数的期望上施加约束，形式化地将现有最大/期望功率约束及最近的均值-方差约束等纳入特例。前提条件为函数的增长与连续性。通过对高斯信道的最小平均错误概率进行精确表征，转换为对分布的优化问题，并在Prokhorov度量下研究紧致性、识别极点、应用Bauer最大原理。

Result: 给出高斯信道下最小平均错误概率作为一阶与二阶编码速率的函数的精确表述。

Conclusion: 该框架能泛化现有功率约束（包括最大功率、期望功率、均值-方差等约束），为编码设计提供统一的理论工具；对对偶分析的贡献在于通过对分布集合的极值问题获得最优编码策略的结构信息。

Abstract: Motivated by refined asymptotic results based on the normal approximation, we study how higher-order coding performance depends on the mean power $Γ$ as well as on finer statistics of the input power. We introduce a multifaceted power model in which the expectation of an arbitrary number of arbitrary functions of the normalized average power is constrained. The framework generalizes existing models, recovering the standard maximal and expected power constraints and the recent mean and variance constraint as special cases. Under certain growth and continuity assumptions on the functions, our main theorem gives an exact characterization of the minimum average error probability for Gaussian channels as a function of the first- and second-order coding rates. The converse proof reduces the code design problem to minimization over a compact (under the Prokhorov metric) set of probability distributions, characterizes the extreme points of this set and invokes the Bauer's maximization principle.

### [12] [Mutual Information Bounds in the Shuffle Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15051)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文首次从信息论角度系统研究单消息洗牌模型，给出洗牌 only 场景和 shuffle-DP 场景下隐私信息泄露的渐进行为及界限；在 shuffle-only 的基本配置下推导 I(Y1; Z) 与 I(K; Z) 的渐近表达式；在 shuffle-DP 场景下给出总信息泄露的上界，揭示泄露与 ε0 及样本量 n 的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望以信息论视角量化洗牌模型中的隐私保护程度，建立基于互信息的隐私度量与 shuffle-DP 之间的联系。

Method: 建立 Z 为经乱序后的输出序列，研究两种设置的互信息量：shuffle-only 下的 I(Y1; Z) 与 I(K; Z)，以及 shuffle-DP 下的 I(K; Z) 与 I(X1; Z | (Xi)_{i≥2}) 的上界。基本配置为 Y1 ~ P，其他用户独立同分布于 Q，讨论 n 趋于无穷时的渐近行为，并扩展到异质用户分布。

Result: shuffle-only：给出 I(Y1; Z) 与 I(K; Z) 的渐近表达；shuffle-DP：若每个用户采用 ε0-DP 机制，则 I(K; Z) ≤ 2ε0，I(X1; Z | (X_i)_{i≥2}) ≤ (e^{ε0}-1)/(2n) + O(n^{-3/2})，实现对信息泄露的严格界限。

Conclusion: 建立了 shuffle DP 与基于互信息的隐私分析之间的联系，为单消息洗牌模型的隐私性提供信息论框架与渐近界限，并可扩展至异质分布场景。

Abstract: The shuffle model enhances privacy by anonymizing users' reports through random permutation. This paper presents the first systematic study of the single-message shuffle model from an information-theoretic perspective. We analyze two regimes: the shuffle-only setting, where each user directly submits its message ($Y_i=X_i$), and the shuffle-DP setting, where each user first applies a local $\varepsilon_0$-differentially private mechanism before shuffling ($Y_i=\mathcal{R}(X_i)$). Let $\boldsymbol{Z} = (Y_{σ(i)})_i$ denote the shuffled sequence produced by a uniformly random permutation $σ$, and let $K = σ^{-1}(1)$ represent the position of user 1's message after shuffling.
  For the shuffle-only setting, we focus on a tractable yet expressive \emph{basic configuration}, where the target user's message follows $Y_1 \sim P$ and the remaining users' messages are i.i.d.\ samples from $Q$, i.e., $Y_2,\dots,Y_n \sim Q$. We derive asymptotic expressions for the mutual information quantities $I(Y_1;\boldsymbol{Z})$ and $I(K;\boldsymbol{Z})$ as $n \to \infty$, and demonstrate how this analytical framework naturally extends to settings with heterogeneous user distributions.
  For the shuffle-DP setting, we establish information-theoretic upper bounds on total information leakage. When each user applies an $\varepsilon_0$-DP mechanism, the overall leakage satisfies $I(K; \boldsymbol{Z}) \le 2\varepsilon_0$ and $I(X_1; \boldsymbol{Z}\mid (X_i)_{i=2}^n) \le (e^{\varepsilon_0}-1)/(2n) + O(n^{-3/2})$. These results bridge shuffle differential privacy and mutual-information-based privacy.

TL;DR: 提出两类广义重复码(GRCs)以应对两种重复传输模型（Type-I 与 Type-II），在同一纠错码下实现多指标度量下的多轮错误纠正，获得大量最优的Type-I和Type-II GRCs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在通信通道存在固有不确定性时，传统的两层冗余结构与有限轮重传优化解码成功概率；通过引入多最小距离的GRCs实现对多轮传错的更强纠错能力。

Method: 提出对应Type-I和Type-II的两类广义重复码GRCs；将GRCs视为在多种度量下的纠错编码，具备多重最小距离；分别分析Type-I与Type-II的界限与构造，给出大量的最优GRCs。

Result: 给出Type-I与Type-II GRCs的界限与构造，获得大量最优解；理论上证明多重最小距离提升多轮纠错能力。

Conclusion: GRCs允许在有限轮传输内通过多轮纠错实现更强的可靠性，优于经典单一度量编码，但构造难度较高；本文对两种重复模型的GRCs进行了分离研究并给出多组最优解。

Abstract: The inherent uncertainty of communication channels implies that any coding scheme has a non-zero probability of failing to correct errors, making retransmission mechanisms essential. To ensure message reliability and integrity, a dual-layer redundancy framework is typically employed: error correction codes mitigate noise-induced impairments at the physical layer, while cyclic redundancy checks verify message integrity after decoding. Retransmission is initiated if verification fails. This operational model can be categorized into two types of repeated communication models: Type-I systems repeatedly transmit identical codewords, whereas Type-II systems transmit distinct coded representations of the same message. The core challenge lies in maximizing the probability of correct message decoding within a limited number of transmission rounds through verification-based feedback mechanisms.
  In this paper, we consider a scenario where the same error-correcting code is used for repeated transmissions, and we specifically propose two classes of generalized repetition codes (GRCs), corresponding to the two repeated communication models. In contrast to classical theory, we regard GRCs as error-correcting codes under multiple metrics--that is, GRCs possess multiple minimum distances. This design enables GRCs to perform multi-round error correction under different metrics, achieving stronger error-correction capabilities than classical error-correcting codes. However, the special structure of GRCs makes their construction more challenging, as it requires simultaneously optimizing multiple minimum distances. To address this, we separately investigate the bounds and constructions for Type-I and Type-II GRCs, and obtain numerous optimal Type-I and Type-II GRCs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释理论上需要大量公共随机性的现象与实际中看不到这种资源之间的矛盾。

Method: 提出一个以普遍 critic 检查单个重构实现或其批次为约束的现实主义约束，推导该约束下的最优率失真关系，并证明在没有公共随机性的情况下可渐近实现。

Result: 给出在现实主义约束下的最优率失真界，并证明通常情况下无需公共随机性即可达到该界，只有当批量大小不切实际时才需要。

Conclusion: 现实主义约束在常见批量规模下可行，解释了理论资源与实践之间的差距，强调批量处理规模的重要性。

Abstract: Realism constraints (or constraints on perceptual quality) have received considerable recent attention within the context of lossy compression, particularly of images. Theoretical studies of lossy compression indicate that high-rate common randomness between the compressor and the decompressor is a valuable resource for achieving realism. On the other hand, the utility of significant amounts of common randomness has not been noted in practice. We offer an explanation for this discrepancy by considering a realism constraint that requires satisfying a universal critic that inspects realizations of individual compressed reconstructions, or batches thereof. We characterize the optimal rate-distortion trade-off under such a realism constraint, and show that it is asymptotically achievable without any common randomness, unless the batch size is impractically large.

Abstract: Deploying foundation models (FMs) on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) promises broad ``low-altitude economy'' applications. Split federated learning (SFL)-based fine-tuning leverages distributed data while keeping raw data local and reduces client-side burden by partitioning the model between client and server. However, the per-round training latency is dominated by stragglers. Training paradigms featuring parallel gradient transmission (GT) allocate dedicated portions of downlink communication resources to each client. They may leave resources idle and suffer from prolonged GT latency, especially in UAV networks, where the communication latency typically far exceeds the computation latency. To address this, we propose a sequential GT paradigm, where the server dedicates all downlink resources for the current GT. We further propose communication-pipelined SFL (CPSFL), characterized by downlink GT priority scheduling and intra-round asynchronous training. We investigate CPSFL-based LoRA fine-tuning of FMs in UAV networks and formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of per-round training latency and worst-case client energy consumption by optimizing the split point selection (SPS) and the computing and communication resource allocation (CCRA) (the uplink bandwidth allocation and the server computing frequency allocation). To solve this problem, we develop an attention-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where the base station agent decides the split point and the CCRA in each round by leveraging previous round information, including UAV trajectories. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based CPSFL scheme outperforms the parallel GT benchmarks, the ablation variants, the fixed CCRA scheme, while approaching the best fixed-SPS scheme.

### [16] [Transformer Injectivity & Geometric Robustness - Analytic Margins and Bi-Lipschitz Uniformity of Sequence-Level Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14808)
*Mikael von Strauss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 理论上，decoder-only Transformer 在给定假设下提示到最后隐藏状态的映射普遍可注入，存在一个开致密的注入区，并可沿训练保持；同时给出对称性与几何诊断，实验在多模型和量化条件下验证可注入性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示提示到最后隐藏状态映射的注入性结构、在训练和对称性约束下的持久性，以及提供易用的几何诊断来评估实际可逆性。

Method: 引入每层的碰撞判别 Δ^ℓ 与注入区间 U^ℓ，证明二分定理；在优化器非奇异性与初始化绝对连续性假设下，证明训练轨迹上的泛化注入性；将判别与注入区间下投到商空间 Θ/G；提出分离边距和 co-Lipschitz 常数的几何诊断，并通过最近邻统计对 LLaMA-3、Qwen 和从头训练的 GPT-2 进行实证分析，比较全精度、8 位和 4 位量化。

Result: 理论结果包括二分定理、开致密注入区间，以及沿训练的注入性保持；对称性下降到 Θ/G 后仍是等价类性质；实验指出全精度与 8 位下无碰撞，4 位下出现少量碰撞且 co-Lipschitz 降低；GPT-2 从头训练时指标稳定；总体结论是连续参数的理想化下 Transformer 表征通常可注入，实际可逆性可通过简单几何诊断评估。

Conclusion: 在连续参数理想化下，Transformer 表征具有普遍且持久的注入性；但实际可逆性要靠量化等因素，且可通过几何诊断进行探测和评估。

Abstract: Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $Δ^\ell \subset Θ$ and injective stratum $U^\ell = Θ\setminus Δ^\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\ell_θ$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $Θ/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.
  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示输入变化与输出修改之间的推理关系（DER 基于抽象规则的推理模式），并评估 LLM 的 Derivation Capability，以提升其问题解决能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 正式定义 Derivation Relation (DR)；2) 引入 Derivation Capability (DC) 概念；3) 构建系统化评估框架 DEVAL 用于七大主流任务与五个 LLM 及一个 Large Reasoning Model 的评估；4) 提出 Derivation Prompting (DP) 作为提升 DC 的提示工程方法；5) 与常用提示工程技术对比。

Result: 主流 LLM（如 GPT-4o、Claude3.5）在 DR 的识别能力中等，但在把 DR 有效应用到问题求解上存在显著下降。DP 对所有测试模型平均提升 DC 约 15.2%，优于常用提示工程方法。

Conclusion: DP 能显著提升 DC，DEVAL 提供了一个系统框架来评估 LLM 推理能力；未来工作可扩展到更多任务、模型及更复杂的推理情境。

Abstract: Assessing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) over data remains an open and pressing research question. Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios. To improve this, we propose a novel prompt engineering approach called Derivation Prompting (DP). It achieves an average improvement of 15.2% in DC for all tested LLMs, outperforming commonly used prompt engineering techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLATONT: a unified network tomography framework that learns a shared latent state to explain multiple indicators (delay, loss, bandwidth) via multimodal alignment and contrastive learning, improving cross-task generalization and robustness; outperforms task-specific baselines on link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat tomography tasks separately using limited task-specific signals, limiting generalization, interoperability, and interpretability. A unified latent representation can capture common structure across indicators.

Method: Proposes PLATONT, where different network indicators are modeled as projections of a common latent network state. It follows the Platonic Representation Hypothesis and trains with multimodal alignment and contrastive learning to learn the shared latent state; multiple tomography tasks are learned in a shared latent space.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show PLATONT achieves higher accuracy and stronger robustness than existing methods across link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction.

Conclusion: A unified, compact latent representation enables better cross-task generalization and interpretability in network tomography, validating the Platonic Representation approach.

Abstract: Network tomography aims to infer hidden network states, such as link performance, traffic load, and topology, from external observations. Most existing methods solve these problems separately and depend on limited task-specific signals, which limits generalization and interpretability. We present PLATONT, a unified framework that models different network indicators (e.g., delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent network state. Guided by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, PLATONT learns this latent state through multimodal alignment and contrastive learning. By training multiple tomography tasks within a shared latent space, it builds compact and structured representations that improve cross-task generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that PLATONT consistently outperforms existing methods in link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction, achieving higher accuracy and stronger robustness under varying network conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 动态嵌套层次（Dynamic Nested Hierarchies）提出通过让模型在训练和推理阶段自适应调整优化层数、嵌套结构和更新频率，以实现持续学习和对非平稳分布的自适应。理论与经验研究共同支撑此框架的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模模型在非平稳环境中表现欠佳，原因包括架构僵化、更新频率固定，难以进行持续自适应与终身学习。受神经可塑性的启发，需具备自我进化能力以应对分布漂移与长期记忆问题。

Method: 在“嵌套学习”基础上提出动态控制的多层次优化体系，模型能够在训练或推理阶段自主调整层数、嵌套关系以及更新频率。给出系统的数学表述、收敛性证明、表达性界与子线性后悔界，并在语言建模、长期/持续学习、长上下文推理等任务上给出经验性验证。

Result: 理论层面给出收敛性、表达性边界，以及在不同情境下的子线性后悔界；实验层面在语言建模、Continual Learning、长上下文推理等任务中显示出相较于固定架构的性能提升。

Conclusion: 动态嵌套层次为实现自适应、通用人工智能的重要一步，能够使系统具备真正的终身学习能力并对分布漂移具有更强的自适应性。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning models, including large language models, exhibit remarkable capabilities in static tasks yet falter in non-stationary environments due to rigid architectures that hinder continual adaptation and lifelong learning. Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.

TL;DR: GTPO is a turn-level RL method for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning in LLMs, improving over GRPO by 3.0% on diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse-grained trajectory rewards in existing RL (e.g., GRPO) yield weak learning signals for multi-turn TIR, causing stagnation; finer feedback and self-supervised signals are needed.

Method: GTPO introduces turn-level reward assignment, return-based advantage estimation using normalized discounted returns, and self-supervised reward shaping from generated code to densify sparse rewards.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTPO effectively enhances training of LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks and improves performance on complex mathematical reasoning; promising for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) - where models iteratively reason, generate code, and verify through execution - remains challenging for existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.

Conclusion: 这是首个对金融服务场景下统一序列推荐建模的系统性研究，兼顾技术与商业目标，证明 Transformer 框架在 FS 的应用潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in sequential recommendation systems, yet their application in Financial Services (FS) presents distinct practical and modeling challenges for real-time recommendation. These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations.

*Nathan M. Roberts,Xiaosong Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-guided DRL improves training efficiency and energy-optimal takeoff trajectory for eVTOL, achieving similar/better energy efficiency with far fewer training steps than vanilla DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL faces training difficulty and sample inefficiency in high-dimensional, nonlinear control tasks like eVTOL takeoff; need methods to enhance learning efficiency while preserving solution quality.

Method: Integrate a transformer to guide DRL by exploring a realistic state space at each time step; apply to an optimal takeoff trajectory problem for minimal energy consumption; vary control variables (power, wing angle to vertical); compare against a vanilla DRL baseline and a simulation-based energy-optimal reference.

Result: Transformer-guided DRL required 4.57×10^6 time steps (25% of 19.79×10^6 for vanilla DRL) to learn takeoff; achieved 97.2% accuracy on optimal energy consumption vs simulation-based reference, surpassing vanilla DRL's 96.3%.

Conclusion: The transformer-guided DRL approach outperforms vanilla DRL in training efficiency and fidelity to the energy-optimal design, indicating promising potential for complex aerospace control problems; further details on generalization, robustness, and architectural specifics would strengthen the evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offers a promising opportunity to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.

Motivation: 在高风险领域，LLMs 的推理过程不透明、易产生不可靠解且难以排查。为提高可验证性与可调试性，强制或优先使用外部、可验证的工具来解决问题，提升结果的可信度。

Method: 构建一个基于现有 LLM 的工具调用能力的框架 LIT（可检查工具），引入可定制的可靠性成本函数来评估工具的可靠性与易排错性。设计一个 1300 条题目的基准数据集，结合 Harvard USPTO 专利数据集与 NeurIPS 2023 论文数据，覆盖数学、编码、建模等难度层级的题目，允许多次顺序工具调用以解决问题。通过对比使用不同工具路径，评估 LLM 的可靠性与任务表现。

Conclusion: 通过将工具调用结果的可检查性纳入优化目标，LIT 提供一种可追溯的推理路径，提升 LLM 在需要可信性与易排错性的场景中的实际应用潜力；同时提供数据集与成本函数以促进后续评估与改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.

TL;DR: 提出结构化对比学习（SCL），将潜在表示分成不变量、变异和自由三组，通过新颖的变异机制在正样本对内强化区分，以实现对ECG相位移和IMU旋转的鲁棒性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表示学习在遇到语义无关变换时表现脆弱，原因在于“laissez-faire”表示学习：只要任务性能达标，潜在空间便 unrestricted 演化。需要可解释且受控的潜在空间结构以实现鲁棒性与可解释性。

Method: 将潜在空间分区为三类特征：不变量特征在给定变换下保持一致；变异特征通过新颖的变异机制主动区分变换；自由特征保留任务灵活性。引入对比学习的推拉动态，促使变异特征在正样本对内区分，从而实现鲁棒性与可解释性。无需修改模型结构，可直接集成到现有训练流程。

Result: 在ECG相位不变性与IMU旋转鲁棒性上取得显著提升：ECG相似度从0.25提升至0.91；WISDM行为识别在旋转一致性为95.38%时达到86.65%准确率；整体表现优于传统数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 该工作推动从被动数据增强向主动结构化学习的范式转变，使潜在表示更具可解释性与可控性。

Abstract: Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as "laissez-faire" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation. This work represents a paradigm shift from reactive data augmentation to proactive structural learning, enabling interpretable latent representations in neural networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本可能暴露敏感患者信息，DP方法常显著牺牲诊断准确性。尽管DP优化和文本生成性研究进展，尚缺乏对临床语言任务中最有效的隐私保护策略的系统对比。本研究首次在同一任务、相同模型和隐私预算下比较四种训练管线。

Method: 使用同一1B模型、相同隐私预算，针对出院摘要的ICD-9编码任务，比较四种管线：直接DP-SGD、DP合成数据、从DP教师蒸馏知识等。评估在ε=4、6下的诊断准确性和成员推断AUC等隐私指标。

Result: 在中等/放宽隐私预算下，来自DP教师的知识蒸馏优于直接DP-SGD和DP合成数据，最多可恢复约63%的非私有性能；成员推断AUC约为0.5，表明隐私保护较强。不同架构间在隐私-效用权衡上存在显著差异，知识蒸馏被识别为最具实际可用性的隐私保护路径。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是临床NLP中最实用的隐私保护途径；不同管线对隐私-效用的权衡差异显著，应将知识蒸馏优先考虑用于DP背景下的临床文本任务。

Abstract: Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries. All pipelines use identical 1B-parameter models and matched privacy budgets to predict ICD-9 codes. At moderate and relaxed privacy budgets ($\varepsilon \in \{4, 6\}$), knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63\% of the non-private performance whilst maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC $\approx$ 0.5). These findings expose large differences in the privacy-utility trade-off across architectures and identify knowledge distillation as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP.

Motivation: 解决非参数学习中缺乏显式关系建模、校准不足以及对局部证据与全局一致性整合的需求；现有方法在样本量较少和解释性方面存在局限，需在保持高效推理的同时实现更好的校准与边界平滑。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集（包括乳腺病理 IDC）上的实验表明，GM 的准确率可与 kNN、Label Spreading 相当，同时在校准性更好、决策边界更平滑，并且需要的样本量少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模可靠性与关系结构，GM 将局部证据与全局一致性之间建立了 principled 的桥梁，为非参数学习提供了更好的解释性与推理性能。

Abstract: We introduce Graph Memory (GM), a structured non-parametric framework that augments embedding-based inference with a compact, relational memory over region-level prototypes. Rather than treating each training instance in isolation, GM summarizes the embedding space into prototype nodes annotated with reliability indicators and connected by edges that encode geometric and contextual relations. This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning.

*Jeffrey Jiang,Kevin Hong,Emily Kuczynski,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在一个动态时间序列的仿真环境中，结合探测干预的强化学习教育系统显著提高对学生状态的估计与学习表现，但需权衡探测频度与对学生的干扰；结果在不同信息隐藏程度和课程结构下差异显现，探测可提升非期末结构的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ITS中，学生个体差异显著且学习过程部分可观测，需同时利用群体信息与个体状态；通过探测干预来获取额外信息，但要权衡成本与干扰。

Method: 构建可变时间序列的课堂仿真环境，包含辅导、讲座、考试等干预，以及可调节的信息探测干预；训练结合个体状态推断与群体信息的强化学习策略，并与若干基于规则的贪心方法比较；在不同信息隐藏水平和学生分布下评估，并比较不同课程结构（含/不含探测）下的表现。

Result: 探测干预降低了学生状态估计的难度，RL与贪心策略在效果上相近但求解路径不同；信息隐藏水平提高时问题更具挑战，探测显著提升性能；RL在面对更困难的班级时表现受限，但对不同学生分布具有一定的适应性；在非探测的课程结构中，探测策略对提高测验和期中结构的表现尤为有效。

Conclusion: 引入探测干预的动态ITS能有效平衡信息获取与干扰，提升个体状态估计及学习效果；RL方法能利用群体信息并适应分布变化，但在极难情境下仍有挑战；课程设计应考虑引入信息探测以充分发挥学习策略的潜力。

Abstract: While intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can use information from past students to personalize instruction, each new student is unique. Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心律失常的时长与起始点差异较大，现有方法往往未能在受限输入长度下同时捕获局部与全局信息，导致检测与定位不精准，亟需一个能在受控输入长度内有效整合局部与全局信息的 CDSS 框架。

Method: 提出一个包含局部与全局特征提取以及局部-全局信息融合与注意力机制的框架，以实现对心律失常在受控输入长度内的检测与分类；通过对 MITDB 与 AFDB 数据集进行 10 类与 4 类任务评估，重点识别发作的起始点、结束点及持续时间。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效捕捉局部与全局信息及动态，避免信息丢失，从而提高心律失常检测的准确性及发作时间的精确定位，为临床制定更精确的治疗方案提供支持。

Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.

Motivation: Existing Medline mapping efforts were constrained by exponential memory and processing requirements, limiting analyses to small subsets and hindering timely updates.

Method: Design and application of a novel sparse matrix multiplication algorithm that integrates with a self-organizing map (SOM) to process the entire Medline dataset and accommodate changes over time.

Result: The approach yields a more complete map of medical knowledge and improves feasibility for updating the SOM as the dataset evolves.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse-matrix-based SOM framework overcomes scalability barriers and enables comprehensive, dynamic mapping of large biomedical corpora like Medline.

We designed a novel algorithm for sparse matrix multiplication that allowed us to apply a self-organizing map to the entire Medline dataset, allowing for a more complete map of existing medical knowledge. The algorithm also increases the feasibility of refining the self-organizing map to account for changes in the dataset over time.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been significantly improved through reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, LLMs still struggle to consistently verify their own reasoning traces. This raises the research question of how to enhance the self-verification ability of LLMs and whether such an ability can further improve reasoning performance. In this work, we propose GRPO-Verif, an algorithm that jointly optimizes solution generation and self-verification within a unified loss function, with an adjustable hyperparameter controlling the weight of the verification signal. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances self-verification capability while maintaining comparable performance in reasoning.

Motivation: EEG 容易受伪迹和个体差异影响，情感标签主观且噪声大；现有方法单纯依赖 EEG 不确定性容易把噪声误判为难样本；需要在跨模态信息中分辨认知模糊与传感器噪声。

Conclusion: 跨模态一致性结合不确定性的方法可提升 EEG 情感解码在标注噪声下的鲁棒性与数据效率。

Abstract: Deep learning models perform best with abundant, high-quality labels, yet such conditions are rarely achievable in EEG-based emotion recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset examine the efficiency and robustness of ours, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient and noise-tolerant approach for EEG-based affective decoding in brain-computer interface systems.

Conclusion: 将复杂VAE与Kähler几何相结合，获得几何感知的潜在空间、计算更高效且提升表征质量，且通过带权复体积采样实现更稳定的潜在空间。

Abstract: It has been discovered that latent-Euclidean variational autoencoders (VAEs) admit, in various capacities, Riemannian structure. We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level Kähler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian regularization with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric Kähler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a Kähler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying Kähler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.

Motivation: 在工业设备监测中，故障数据稀缺且标注成本高，传统面向充足正常数据的时序生成模型难以准确刻画故障分布，导致生成样本的真实性和多样性不足，难以支撑有效的故障诊断与预测性维护。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够在少样本场景下生成更真实且多样的故障时序样本，有助于提升故障诊断与预测性维护的性能。

Abstract: In industrial equipment monitoring, fault diagnosis is critical for ensuring system reliability and enabling predictive maintenance. However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods in authenticity and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.

Conclusion: MARVAL 为掩码自回归扩散模型的蒸馏与 RL 提供可行路径，实现更快采样和更好的偏好对齐。

Abstract: Masked auto-regressive diffusion models (MAR) benefit from the expressive modeling ability of diffusion models and the flexibility of masked auto-regressive ordering. However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.

TL;DR: KrawtchoukNet 通过离散 Krawtchouk 多项式构建的谱GNN滤波器，固定域大小 N 使递推系数有界，提升对过平滑的鲁棒性；同时引入可学习的形状参数 p，使滤波器自适应图数据的谱响应，在高阶多项式 K 时仍具备SOTA表现，并在异质邻接图数据集（Texas、Cornell）上优于GAT、APPNP等基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多项式滤波的谱GNN（如 ChebNet）在两方面存在不足：对异质性图的性能衰减（低通过性）以及高阶多项式导致的过平滑。原因在于滤波器的静态、低通特性。需要设计既能兼容异质性又能抑制过平滑的滤波器。

Method: 提出 KrawtchoukNet：使用离散 Krawtchouk 多项式定义谱滤波器；设定域大小 N 为较小常数（如 N=20），使递推系数天然有界，增强对过平滑的鲁棒性；引入可学习的形状参数 p，以自适应图数据的谱响应；对比验证在高阶 K 下的表现及在异性数据集上的适应性。

Result: 在高阶多项式 K=10 时达到SOTA水平，显著缓解过平滑现象；在 Texas、Cornell 等异性数据集上优于 GAT、APPNP 等传统GNN，展现对异性图的强适应性。

Conclusion: KrawtchoukNet 为谱GNN滤波器提供一个统一的设计思路：通过固定域大小实现有界递推系数、以及可学习的谱形状参数实现对数据的自适应，解决过平滑与异质性两大难题，并给出在实际数据上的强性能证据。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on polynomial filters, such as ChebyNet, suffer from two critical limitations: 1) performance collapse on "heterophilic" graphs and 2) performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters. In this work, we propose `KrawtchoukNet`, a GNN filter based on the discrete Krawtchouk polynomials. We demonstrate that `KrawtchoukNet` provides a unified solution to both problems through two key design choices. First, by fixing the polynomial's domain N to a small constant (e.g., N=20), we create the first GNN filter whose recurrence coefficients are \textit{inherently bounded}, making it exceptionally robust to over-smoothing (achieving SOTA results at K=10). Second, by making the filter's shape parameter p learnable, the filter adapts its spectral response to the graph data. We show this adaptive nature allows `KrawtchoukNet` to achieve SOTA performance on challenging heterophilic benchmarks (Texas, Cornell), decisively outperforming standard GNNs like GAT and APPNP.

Result: 在多项基准上，ATPO 显著提升推理正确性与训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 利用轨迹动态是推动 dLLM RL 的关键，步级分析与梯度分配策略能够显著提升性能与稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging alongside autoregressive models as a powerful paradigm for complex reasoning, with reinforcement learning increasingly used for downstream alignment. Existing trajectory-based RL methods uniformly allocate policy gradients across denoising steps, implicitly treating all steps as equally important. We challenge this assumption by analyzing trajectories with several step-level metrics: entropy-based uncertainty, Confidence-Margin (CM) uncertainty, and Rate of Entropy Change (RoEC). These reveal structured "zones of confusion": transient spikes in uncertainty and instability that strongly predict final success or failure, while most steps remain stable. We propose Adaptive Trajectory Policy Optimization (ATPO), a lightweight step-selection strategy that dynamically reallocates gradient updates to these high-leverage steps without changing the RL objective, rewards, or compute budget. Using a hybrid RoEC+CM rule, ATPO delivers substantial gains in reasoning accuracy and training stability across benchmarks, showing that exploiting trajectory dynamics is key to advancing dLLM RL.

Motivation: 在长期训练大语言模型时，保持探索的稳定性至关重要，熵用于调控探索并防止早熟收敛。然而现有强化学习方法难以在训练中后续样本的混合影响下维持合适的熵水平，导致训练不稳定或陷入次优解。

Method: 提出 EntroPIC（Entropy stabilization via Proportional-Integral Control），通过动态调整正负样本的损失系数来调节策略熵，使熵在训练过程中保持稳定。理论上对自上而下（on-policy）与自下而上（off-policy）学习均给出控制熵的分析；在大规模LLM训练场景下给出充分的理论与实验验证。

Conclusion: EntroPIC 能有效控制训练过程中的熵，从而实现对大规模强化学习训练中探索的高效管理，具备在其他 RL 设置中推广的潜力。

Abstract: Long-term training of large language models (LLMs) requires maintaining stable exploration to prevent the model from collapsing into sub-optimal behaviors. Entropy is crucial in this context, as it controls exploration and helps avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to maintain an appropriate level of entropy, as the training process involves a mix of positive and negative samples, each affecting entropy in different ways across steps. To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients. This approach stabilizes entropy throughout training, ensuring efficient exploration and steady progress. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis for both on-policy and off-policy learning settings, demonstrating that EntroPIC is effective at controlling entropy in large-scale LLM training. Experimental results show that our method successfully maintains desired entropy levels, enabling stable and optimal RL training for LLMs.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), has proved its effectiveness in practical applications such as DeepSeek-R1. It raises a question whether GRPO can be generalized to representation learning models. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Policy Optimization for Representation Model (GRPO-RM), and investigate the performance of GRPO-like policy in post-training representation models. Specifically, our method establishes a predefined output set to functionally replace token sequence sampling in LLMs, thereby generating an output group, which is essential for the probability-driven optimization of GRPO. In addition, a specialized reward function is designed to accommodate the properties of representation models. Extensive experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [40] [SNAP: Low-Latency Test-Time Adaptation with Sparse Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15276)
*Hyeongheon Cha,Dong Min Kim,Hye Won Chung,Taesik Gong,Sung-Ju Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNAP: 一种稀疏化时域适应框架，通过CnDRM与IoBMN在高效、低数据量的情况下实现对抗分布漂移的鲁棒性，能在仅1%数据的设定下保持竞争性准确率，显著降低延迟（最高可降至93.12%），且适用于1%-50%自适应速率，误差小于3.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时适应（TTA）方法依赖频繁的适应和高计算成本，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。需要在数据资源有限、延迟敏感的场景中实现稳健且高效的域适应。

Method: 提出两大核心组件：1) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM)，从数据流中筛选并存储具有代表性的样本，覆盖类别和域特征，以便在数据有限时也能高效适应；2) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN)，在推理阶段动态调整归一化统计，利用CnDRM中的样本实现对目标域的高效对齐。该框架可与五个最先进的TTA算法集成，并显著降低适应过程的延迟。

Result: 在1%数据甚至更少的情况下仍能保持竞争性准确性；整体延迟下降最高达到93.12%；在1%至50%的不同适应率下，准确率下降控制在3.3%以内；在边缘设备的实时、低带宽场景中具有良好的适用性。

Conclusion: SNAP展示了在资源受限、对延迟敏感的应用场景中应用TTA的可行性与优势，通过CnDRM与IoBMN实现高效稳定的域适应，同时保持较小的准确率损失和显著的推理加速。代码已公开在GitHub。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) adjusts models using unlabeled test data to handle dynamic distribution shifts. However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%. This demonstrates its strong potential for practical use on edge devices serving latency-sensitive applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/chahh9808/SNAP.

### [41] [Quant-Trim in Practice: Improved Cross-Platform Low-Bit Deployment on Edge NPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15300)
*Rayen Dhahri,Steffen Urban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quant-Trim 提供一种训练阶段的硬件无关检查点生成方法，使量化后在不同后端、不同精度设定（INT8/INT4、对称/非对称、逐通道/逐张量）下都具有鲁棒性，减少 FP 与低比特位量化之间的差距，以及对编译器启发式和标定的依赖，且无需对后端进行特定图优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同边缘加速器厂商的编译器在缩放、裁剪和算子支持上的差异，导致同一个 FP 检查点在不同后端上出现显著精度波动，迫使实践者逐步调整标志位或重构模型以适应厂商友好算子集合，缺乏跨后端一致性。

Method: 在训练阶段引入渐进式伪量化以对齐整数网格；使用反向剪枝以抑制异常值引发的尺度膨胀，同时保持可学习性；方法对量化方案不敏感（对称/非对称、逐张量/逐通道、INT8/INT4等均可），无需厂商特定的图优化或变更，输出硬件中立的检查点。

Result: 在多模型和任务上，缩小了 FP 与低比特之间的差距，降低了对编译器启发式/标定的依赖，避免对每个后端重新训练的需求。并给出在静态/动态激活缩放以及不同算子覆盖下的准确性、边缘端延迟、吞吐、能耗/推理成本等指标。

Conclusion: Quant-Trim 提供一种跨后端鲁棒的训练阶段解决方案，可在不依赖厂商特定优化的前提下实现更稳定的硬件量化性能，减少后端特定调参和重训练的需求。

Abstract: Specialized edge accelerators rely on low-bit quantization, but vendor compilers differ in scaling, clipping, and kernel support, often as black boxes. The same floating-point (FP) checkpoint can therefore yield inconsistent accuracy across backends, forcing practitioners to tweak flags or refactor models to vendor-friendly operator subsets. We introduce Quant-Trim, a training-phase method that produces a hardware-neutral checkpoint robust to backend and precision choices. It combines progressive fake quantization to align training with the deployed integer grid and reverse pruning to tame outlier-driven scale inflation while preserving learnability. Quant-Trim is agnostic to quantization schemes (symmetric/asymmetric,per-tensor/per-channel, INT8/INT4) and requires no vendor-specific graph changes.Across models and tasks, it narrows the FP,low-bit gap, reduces dependence on compiler heuristics/calibration, and avoids per-backend retraining. We report accuracy and edge metrics latency, throughput, energy/inference, and cost under static/dynamic activation scaling and varying operator coverage.

TL;DR: 本研究揭示TSFM的层次语义：早期层捕获局部时间模式，深层编码分散性与变动时间信号；谱/扭曲等很难线性还原；在概念组合时探针表现下降，干扰显现；原子概念定位可靠，组合表征仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TSFM在时间序列概念表示中的机制与局限，提升对其可解释性与潜在改进的理解。

Method: 通过层级分析、线性可恢复性测试、表示相似性度量等方法，对TSFM进行系统探测。

Result: 早层捕捉局部时间模式（如AR(1)、水平跃变、趋势），深层捕捉离散性、变化时间信号；谱和扭曲因素最难线性恢复；在组合情境下探针性能下降，概念间存在干扰。

Conclusion: 原子概念可定位，但对交互时间现象的组合表示仍是挑战，提示当前TSFM在概念组合方面的局限，需要后续改进。

Abstract: Time-series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently emerged as a universal paradigm for learning across diverse temporal domains. However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts. This highlights that while atomic concepts are reliably localized, composition remains a challenge, underscoring a key limitation in current TSFMs' ability to represent interacting temporal phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，集成（如堆叠）通常能显著提升准确性；然而在时间序列预测领域，集成方法应用不足，简单线性组合仍被认为是常态，需要系统地评估与改进。

Method: 系统性评估33种集成模型（现有与新颖）在50个真实世界数据集上的表现；提出一个多层堆叠框架，将不同的堆叠模型的优点结合起来以改进预测。

Result: 堆叠方法在时间序列预测中实现了一致的准确性提升；没有单一堆叠器在所有任务上最优；多层堆叠框架在多样化预测场景中表现出显著的 superior accuracy。

Conclusion: 基于堆叠的方法具备显著提升时间序列预测AutoML系统性能的潜力。

Abstract: Ensembling is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of machine learning models, with methods like stacking achieving strong results in tabular tasks. In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized, with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML systems for time series forecasting.

*Eddie Conti,Álvaro Parafita,Axel Brando*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的局部特征重要性解释方法：Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID)，通过对正负反事实分布建模并基于分布差异度量进行特征排序，在忠实度方面优于基线方法，具备互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏客观、可比的 ground truth 来评估局部特征重要性解释方法，亟需更严谨的、理论化的度量来衡量解释的真实性和可信度；现有方法众多但缺乏统一基准。

Method: 提出 CID：生成两组正反事实样本（正向与负向），用核密度估计（KDE）拟合它们的分布，再以一种分布差异度量对特征进行排序，形成局部重要性解释；并与公认的局部解释器进行对比，检验在忠实度指标上的表现。

Result: 与现有局部重要性解释器比较时，CID 提供互补性视角，并在忠实度指标（comprehensiveness 与 sufficiency）上实现改进，使解释更可信。

Conclusion: CID 展现出成为模型分析中有价值工具的潜力，尤其在提供更稳健的局部重要性评估方面。

Abstract: Assessing the importance of individual features in Machine Learning is critical to understand the model's decision-making process. While numerous methods exist, the lack of a definitive ground truth for comparison highlights the need for alternative, well-founded measures. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc local feature importance method called Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID). We generate two sets of positive and negative counterfactuals, model their distributions using Kernel Density Estimation, and rank features based on a distributional dissimilarity measure. This measure, grounded in a rigorous mathematical framework, satisfies key properties required to function as a valid metric. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by comparing with well-established local feature importance explainers. Our method not only offers complementary perspectives to existing approaches, but also improves performance on faithfulness metrics (both for comprehensiveness and sufficiency), resulting in more faithful explanations of the system. These results highlight its potential as a valuable tool for model analysis.

### [45] [Parameter Importance-Driven Continual Learning for Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15375)
*Lingxiang Wang,Hainan Zhang,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIECE: a parameter-importance-based continual enhancement method that updates only 0.1% of core parameters to learn domain knowledge without forgetting, using PIECE-F and PIECE-S estimators, achieving state-of-the-art continual learning across language and multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific post-training often causes catastrophic forgetting, degrading general reasoning and adaptability. Conventional continual learning methods struggle with downstream performance, data access, or parameter overhead; while PET methods depend on tuning choices. A method that preserves general abilities while efficiently acquiring domain knowledge is needed.

Method: PIECE updates only 0.1% of the most important parameters, as determined by two estimators. PIECE-F estimates parameter importance via Fisher Information; PIECE-S uses a second-order normalization combining gradient and curvature information. Importantly, training does not require access to historical data and does not add new parameters.

Result: Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models demonstrate that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: PIECE provides a practical, scalable path to domain-adaptive foundation models that mitigate catastrophic forgetting without increasing parameter counts or requiring past data.

Abstract: Domain-specific post-training often causes catastrophic forgetting, making foundation models lose their general reasoning ability and limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world environments. Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information. Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models show that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks. Our results highlight a practical path to scalable, domain-adaptive foundation models without catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: 解决非线性、非高斯状态空间模型中贝叶斯推断的计算困难，寻求在可控计算成本下实现递推状态估计的通用框架。

Method: 将贝叶斯推断转化为一系列带约束的熵性信任域优化问题，形成一类前向-后向算法；算法结构由 variational 后验的因子化方式决定；在 Gauss–Markov 近似下推导递推式；对于通用非线性、非高斯模型，使用广义统计线性回归和傅里叶-赫尔姆特矩匹配来闭合递推。

Result: 给出具有较低计算复杂度的前向-后向递推算法族；在一般非线性、非高斯模型上通过闭合策略实现递推计算。

Conclusion: 所提出的变分拉格朗日框架提供一个灵活高效的状态估计工具，可在不同因子化和近似策略下实现准确性与计算成本之间的权衡。

Abstract: We present a class of algorithms for state estimation in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach is based on a variational Lagrangian formulation that casts Bayesian inference as a sequence of entropic trust-region updates subject to dynamic constraints. This framework gives rise to a family of forward-backward algorithms, whose structure is determined by the chosen factorization of the variational posterior. By focusing on Gauss--Markov approximations, we derive recursive schemes with favorable computational complexity. For general nonlinear, non-Gaussian models we close the recursions using generalized statistical linear regression and Fourier--Hermite moment matching.

Motivation: 理解表格ICL模型中逐层的表征与贡献，揭示潜在冗余，提升效率与可解释性，并探索与大型语言模型（LLMs）在层级动态上的相似性。

Method: 对TabPFN与TabICL在各层的潜在空间进行分析，采用“layers as painters”的视角，考察跨层表征语言的一致性，识别冗余层，并与LLMs的层级动态进行对比。

Result: 仅有子集层共享共同的表征语言，存在显著的结构性冗余；这一发现为模型压缩与解释性提升提供机会，并揭示与LLMs之间在层级动态上的可比性与差异。

Conclusion: 层级表征的分解揭示了表格ICL模型的冗余结构，指向通过裁剪或聚合层以实现压缩，同时提升对模型决策过程的理解；也为跨域比较提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Despite the architectural similarities between tabular in-context learning (ICL) models and large language models (LLMs), little is known about how individual layers contribute to tabular prediction. In this paper, we investigate how the latent spaces evolve across layers in tabular ICL models, identify potential redundant layers, and compare these dynamics with those observed in LLMs. We analyze TabPFN and TabICL through the "layers as painters" perspective, finding that only subsets of layers share a common representational language, suggesting structural redundancy and offering opportunities for model compression and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法表明基于TSFM的在-context学习分类可成为更广泛的AI驱动维护系统的重要组成部分，推动从定制窄域AI向更通用的维护解决方案的转变。

Abstract: This paper introduces a classification method using in-context learning in time-series foundation models (TSFM). We show how data, which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning. We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions. This marks significant progress beyond custom narrow AI solutions towards broader, AI-driven maintenance systems.

Motivation: 在无线边缘系统中，由于资源异质性、客户端贡献不均和通信容量有限，如何在不牺牲模型准确性的前提下实现高效节能和公平参与成为挑战。

Method: 将贡献分数（包含更新幅度和压缩比）引入联合优化问题，设计 FairEnergy 以实现设备选择、带宽分配和压缩级别的混合整数非凸问题。通过放松二进制选择变量并用拉格朗日分解处理全局带宽耦合，随后对每个设备进行子问题优化。

Result: 在非独立同分布（non-IID）数据情形下，FairEnergy 相较基线策略在提高准确度的同时，能量消耗降低高达 79%。

Conclusion: FairEnergy 提供了一种可用于无线边缘 FL 的公平且高效的能量优化框架，显示出在资源异质性和有限通信带宽环境下改进模型性能与能耗的潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, balancing energy efficiency and fair participation while ensuring high model accuracy remains challenging in wireless edge systems due to heterogeneous resources, unequal client contributions, and limited communication capacity. To address these challenges, we propose FairEnergy, a fairness-aware energy minimization framework that integrates a contribution score capturing both the magnitude of updates and their compression ratio into the joint optimization of device selection, bandwidth allocation, and compression level. The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is solved by relaxing binary selection variables and applying Lagrangian decomposition to handle global bandwidth coupling, followed by per-device subproblem optimization. Experiments on non-IID data show that FairEnergy achieves higher accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 79\% compared to baseline strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率隐式神经表示（INR）需要在数百万坐标上进行优化，计算成本极高，迫切需要高效的训练策略来加速收敛。

Method: 提出NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT)，利用神经张量核（NTK）对每个坐标的梯度影响进行打分，评分基于NTK扩展的损失梯度范数，兼顾拟合误差与坐标之间的耦合/自我影响，动态选择优先更新的坐标，提升收敛速度。

Result: 大量实验表明，NINT将训练时间几乎降低一半，同时保持或提升表示质量，在最近的采样基础方法中达到最先进的加速水平。

Conclusion: NTK引导的坐标选择为INR训练提供了有效的加速手段；通过同时考虑拟合误差与跨坐标耦合，NINT实现了更快的收敛并具有良好的泛化能力，适用于多种INR任务。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) parameterize continuous signals via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enabling compact, resolution-independent modeling for tasks like image, audio, and 3D reconstruction. However, fitting high-resolution signals demands optimizing over millions of coordinates, incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address it, we propose NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT), which accelerates training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

Method: 通过理论推导给出 realizable 的样本复杂度上界、提出 agnostic 的近似算法、引入 OODS 框架并推导轮复杂度的上/下界。

Result: Realizable：样本复杂度约为 d k^{Θ(1/r)} / ε；Agnostic：给出近似最优的算法，在 ~√k 轮内实现近似最优的样本复杂度 ~((d+k)/ε^2)；提出 OODS 框架，给出近似紧的轮复杂度界，上界对应 ~√k 轮的算法，下界表明要达到 sub-polynomial 轮需新的方法。

Conclusion: OODS 框架统一了 MDL 的按需采样策略，揭示了样本-轮数权衡的基本极限，并提出了实现该极限的边界条件。

Abstract: We study the tradeoff between sample complexity and round complexity in on-demand sampling, where the learning algorithm adaptively samples from $k$ distributions over a limited number of rounds. In the realizable setting of Multi-Distribution Learning (MDL), we show that the optimal sample complexity of an $r$-round algorithm scales approximately as $dk^{Θ(1/r)} / ε$. For the general agnostic case, we present an algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O((d + k) / ε^2)$ within $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$ rounds. Of independent interest, we introduce a new framework, Optimization via On-Demand Sampling (OODS), which abstracts the sample-adaptivity tradeoff and captures most existing MDL algorithms. We establish nearly tight bounds on the round complexity in the OODS setting. The upper bounds directly yield the $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$-round algorithm for agnostic MDL, while the lower bounds imply that achieving sub-polynomial round complexity would require fundamentally new techniques that bypass the inherent hardness of OODS.

Motivation: 5G O-RAN 的控制平面因集成、虚拟化和分解带来新的攻击面，RA信令风暴易导致CU/RRC処理链路拥塞，现有n-RT RIC 的控制回路延迟使其难以在毫秒级时效内响应攻击。

Method: 在可编程的Tofino交换机上实现轻量级RF分类器，将RA信令流在数据平面进行实时检测与过滤，实现线速处理与确定性微秒级推断。

Result: 实现>94% 的检测准确率，单流推断延迟约3.4微秒，在不同负载下维持高效检测与缓解，满足O-RAN 控制平面时限要求。

Conclusion: 将ML检测直接下沉到数据平面，提供快速、可扩展的RA信令风暴保护方案，提升5G O-RAN 的鲁棒性与 QoS 保证能力。

Abstract: The disaggregation and virtualization of 5G Open RAN (O-RAN) introduces new vulnerabilities in the control plane that can greatly impact the quality of service (QoS) of latency-sensitive 5G applications and services. One critical issue is Random Access (RA) signaling storms where, a burst of illegitimate or misbehaving user equipments (UEs) send Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection requests that rapidly saturate a Central Unit's (CU) processing pipeline. Such storms trigger widespread connection failures within the short contention resolution window defined by 3GPP. Existing detection and mitigation approaches based on near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (n-RT RIC) applications cannot guarantee a timely reaction to such attacks as RIC control loops incur tens to hundreds of milliseconds of latency due to the non-deterministic nature of their general purpose processor (GPP) based architectures. This paper presents RAID, an in-network RA signaling storm detection and mitigation system that leverages P4-programmable switch ASICs to enable real-time protection from malicious attacks. RAID embeds a lightweight Random Forest (RF) classifier into a programmable Tofino switch, enabling line-rate flow classification with deterministic microsecond-scale inference delay. By performing ML-based detection directly in the data plane, RAID catches and filters malicious RA requests before they reach and overwhelm the RRC. RAID achieves above 94% detection accuracy with a fixed per-flow inference delay on the order of 3.4 microseconds, effectively meeting strict O-RAN control-plane deadlines. These improvements are sustained across multiple traffic loads, making RAID a fast and scalable solution for the detection and mitigation of signaling storms in 5G O-RAN.

Abstract: We develop a $μ$-analysis and synthesis framework for infinite-dimensional systems that leverages the Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) to compute the structured singular value's upper bound. The methodology formulates robust stability and performance conditions jointly as Linear Partial Integral Inequalities within the Partial Integral Equation framework, establishing connections between IQC multipliers and $μ$-theory. Computational implementation via PIETOOLS enables computational tools that practically applicable to spatially distributed infinite dimensional systems. Illustrations with the help of Partial and Delay Differential Equations validate the effectiveness of the framework, showing a significant reduction in conservatism compared to unstructured methods and providing systematic tools for stability-performance trade-off analysis.

TL;DR: 提出一种自上而下的框架，用于评估商业与工业用户的用电负荷迁移灵活性价值，从系统运行时间、功率容量、能量容量和往返效率等指标出发，在不同区域和季节下给出成本节省和排放节约的量化范围，并指出排放减排的潜力高度依赖情景，常常比区域可再生能源证书或社會成本等基准低几个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要鼓励异质负荷对灵活性的参与；负荷特性、价格和排放因子在时空上高度异质，现有工具难以全面估价灵活性对成本和减排的影响，因此需要一个能够普适评估灵活性价值的上层筛选框架。

Method: 提出一个自上而下的筛选方法，通过系统运行时间、功率容量、能量容量和往返效率四个核心指标来评估灵活性潜在收益；在不同区域与季节下，基于价格和排放因子的时空变化，估算节省的成本和排放量，并给出灵活性价值随负荷特征与激励条件变化的规律。

Result: 在区域与季节依赖的情境下，灵活性带来的成本节省范围为0%至超过100%，排放节省通常为5%-40%；排放减排的量级高度可变，某些情形下甚至比区域碳信用、社会成本等基准低出数个数量级（约四个数量级）。灵活性的价值是高度动态的，按负荷特征与激励条件估算节省，可以为新系统的启发式设计、选址策略、与其他减排选项的比较，以及激励灵活性的新的途径提供信息。

Conclusion: 灵活性价值处于动态范围，建立以负荷特征和激励条件为自变量的节省估计框架，有助于优化系统设计、比较减排路径以及设计针对性的激励机制。

Abstract: Load shifting by commercial and industrial power consumers reduces costs and Scope 2 emissions for the consumer and the grid. Incentivizing this behavior requires tools for valuing flexibility amidst the heterogeneity in load characteristics across diverse sectors and the spatiotemporal variation in electricity prices and emissions factors. This work presents a top-down approach to screen and broadly understand the benefits of flexibility based on system uptime, power capacity (PC), energy capacity (EC), and round- trip efficiency (RTE). Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon. While the value of flexibility is highly dynamic, estimating savings as a function of load characteristics and incentives can inform heuristic design of new systems, siting strategies, comparison of flexibility to other decarbonization options, and new avenues for incentivizing flexibility.

Abstract: Spatially distributed peripheral nerve recordings can be used to reconstruct motor intention and improve natural control of prosthetics in patients with limb deficiencies. However, many existing clinical solutions rely on percutaneous wires to access peripheral nerves; these sites are prone to infection and electrode degradation, preventing chronic use. To enable longterm recording of deeply-seated peripheral nerves, this paper presents DustNet: a network of ultrasonically-powered neural recording implants capable of supporting up to 8 simultaneously recording nodes over a single ultrasound link. To enable high throughput multi-implant communication, DustNet implements a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) protocol with up to 16-level amplitude modulation of the ultrasound backscatter that achieves up to 4x higher data rates than traditional on-off keying methods. Each neural implant consists of a 0.7x0.7x0.7 mm^3 piezoceramic transducer, a 10 nF off-chip capacitor, and an IC mounted on a flexible PCB. The implant IC was fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.43 mm^2. System functionality was verified within FDA power limits at 90mm depth, achieving a maximum data rate of 400 kb/s at 2 MHz ultrasound carrier frequency, with each implant transmitting uplink data at 50 kb/s and dissipating just 7 μW of power

Conclusion: 输出惩罚项的逆最优框架能够同时保障ISS与IOS；无扰动情况下，齐次稳定性是可解性的关键条件之一。

Abstract: This work studies the inverse optimality of input-to-state stabilizing controllers with input-output stability guarantees for nonlinear homogeneous systems. We formulate a new inverse optimal control problem, where the cost functional incorporates penalties on the output, in addition to the state, control and disturbance as in current related works. One benefit of penalizing the output is that the resulting inverse optimal controllers can ensure both input-to-state stability and input-output stability. We propose a technique for constructing the corresponding meaningful cost functional by using homogeneity properties, and provide sufficient conditions on solving the inverse optimal gain assignment problem. We show that homogeneous stabilizability of homogeneous systems in the case without disturbance is sufficient for the solvability of inverse optimal gain assignment problem for homogeneous systems.

Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.

Abstract: For the unicycle system, we provide constructive methods for the design of feedback laws that have one or more of the following properties: being nonmodular and globally exponentially stabilizing, inverse optimal, robust to arbitrary decrease or increase of input coefficients, adaptive, prescribed/fixed-time stabilizing, and safe (ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints). Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation. This article, along with its Part I, lays a broad constructive design foundation for stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle.

TL;DR: 基于网格的 Hamilton-Jacobi（HJ） reachability 的有界估计：通过网格上的值迭代同时给出 HJ 值函数的上界和下界，并通过自适应细分单元来在粗网格下也能获得安全域的更精确上确界，进而对后向可达集进行更可靠的上界估计。

Motivation: 离散化误差可能导致对后向可达集的下界/上界不准确，影响安全性验证与控制合成。需要一种在网格上可实现且能提供声称正确的上/下界的方法，并能在粗网格时通过自适应细化改进分类能力。

Conclusion: 给出了一种在网格上计算 HJ 值函数的声音界限的系统框架，并通过自适应细化实现对粗网格的高保真后向可达集近似，为非线性系统的安全验证与控制合成提供鲁棒的工具。

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This study extends transient stability analysis for grid-forming VSCs under asymmetrical faults by deriving the P-δ curve with an elliptical current limiter that explicitly accounts for negative-sequence effects, and validates the theory with simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Under asymmetrical faults, GFM-VSCs exhibit coupled positive- and negative-sequence dynamics and negative-sequence-driven active power, which are not captured by conventional symmetrical-fault analyses. There is a need for accurate transient-stability tools that include negative-sequence effects.

Method: Derive the P-δ curve for a GFM-VSC with an elliptical current limiter under asymmetrical faults by explicitly incorporating negative-sequence components and their interaction with the limiter. Extend traditional symmetrical-fault stability analysis to asymmetrical conditions, with theoretical derivation validated against simulation and experimental results.

Result: A new P-δ curve that includes negative-sequence effects is derived for GFM-VSCs with an elliptical current limiter under asymmetrical faults. The curve agrees with both simulation and experimental results.

Conclusion: Incorporating negative-sequence dynamics yields more accurate transient-stability assessments under asymmetrical faults and enables a principled extension of conventional analyses to such conditions.

Abstract: Under asymmetrical faults, analyzing the transient stability of grid-forming voltage-source converters (GFM-VSCs) becomes essential because their behavior fundamentally differs from that under symmetrical faults. When current limiting is activated under asymmetrical faults, the point-of-common-coupling voltage of a GFM-VSC contains both positive- and negative-sequence components, and the interaction between these components generates a non-negligible negative-sequence-driven active power. However, the transient stability of GFM-VSCs under asymmetrical faults has not been sufficiently investigated, and the influence of negative-sequence-driven active power remains unclear. Accordingly, this letter derives the P-δ curve of a GFM-VSC with an elliptical current limiter under asymmetrical faults by explicitly accounting for negative-sequence effects. This enables a more accurate transient stability assessment when extending conventional symmetrical-fault analyses to asymmetrical conditions. The theoretical analysis is validated by the agreement between the derived P-δ curve and both simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: This article proposes an optimization problem formulation to find the optimal sizes of Photovoltaics (PV) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for individual participants within the context of the Renewable Energy Community (REC). An optimization problem considered the dynamic nature of electricity pricing, solar irradiation levels, financial aspects such as capital investment, and operational and maintenance expenditures of PV and BESS. The analysis also considered replacement costs and the efficiency of charging and discharging the BESS unit. We employed Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) to determine the optimal system size that maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of individual participants. Furthermore, in this study, we used daily representative signals for each season of the year to reduce simulation runtime. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) was used to extract these signals. Then, these representative signals obtained were used in the optimization problem formulation to reduce simulation time and extend our analysis to a wider planning horizon. In addition, the study introduced fairness by applying the individual marginal contribution method to distribute incentives equitably among REC participants, ensuring that each member benefited from their contribution. A simulation study was conducted using a real demand dataset of five houses located in Roseto Valfortore, a small town and commune in the Foggia Province of the Apulia region in southern Italy, to demonstrate the practical relevance and usefulness of the ideas discussed. Ultimately, the goal of the article was to empower the REC with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and shape the future of sustainable energy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示收缩理论如何解释跨试验脉冲时序的稳定性，从动力学角度链接可重复的尖峰放电与事件检测的鲁棒性。

Method: 在生理参数集合上证明无强驱动情况下的增量指数稳定性；在含脉冲输入时证明在平均驻留时间条件下仍具收缩性，并对周期性脉冲列给出明确的脉冲间期下界；在高速极限分析下通道导通几乎恒定、产生自维持的极限环时，收缩不再成立。

Result: 给出在特定输入范畴内系统保持收缩，从而实现跨试验的尖峰时序鲁棒性的理论保障；在高速极限下暴露出收缩失效并产生自维持振荡的情形；数值仿真验证上述两种状态与边界条件。

Conclusion: 收缩理论为连续时间框架提供了预测何时事件检测提取的尖峰时序在不同试验中保持一致性的工具；同时指出在导通性近似恒定且进入极限环时将失去收敛性，给出可操作的驻留时间与脉冲间期界限。

Abstract: We analyze contraction in conductance-based excitable systems and link it to reliable spike timing. For a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron with synaptic input, we prove the unforced dynamics is incrementally exponentially stable on a compact physiological set. With impulsive inputs, contraction persists under an average dwell-time condition, and for periodic spike trains we derive an explicit lower bound on the inter-impulse period. In the high-rate limit the synapse is effectively held open, the conductance is nearly constant, and self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations can arise, so contraction no longer holds. This continuous-time view explains when spike times extracted by an event detector remain robust across trials, and simulations confirm both regimes.

TL;DR: 提出一种在受限耦合不确定性条件下的鲁棒控制框架。通过对最坏情形进行搜索，结合上确界-C1函数理论，证明可使用标准光滑优化算法在非光滑约束优化问题中求解。先用蒙特卡洛或粒子群优化遍历参数空间，再用顺序二次规划进行局部优化并求解KKT点；最后通过活跃集方法进行非光滑多模型控制器优化。应用于含柔性附体的卫星基准系统，结果显示在分钟级别内找到罕见最坏情形并收敛至少于10个活跃配置，显著优于纯蒙特卡洛方法。该框架对高维参数问题具有良好可扩展性，但在全局全局最优性方面仍无形式保証。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展标准H∞/H2鲁棒控制与分析工具，使其在参数之间存在耦合且受约束的情况下仍能进行有效的最坏情形搜索；利用现成的光滑优化算法解决非光滑约束优化问题；提高在高维参数空间中寻找最坏配置的效率与可扩展性。

Method: 基于upper-C1函数理论，将最坏情形搜索分为：1) 在参数空间中通过Monte Carlo采样或粒子群优化进行粗搜索；2) 使用Sequential Quadratic Programming对找到的候选进行局部利用，获得Karush-Kuhn-Tucker点；3) 将得到的最坏配置加入活动集合，并在该集合上进行非光滑的多模型优化来合成鲁棒控制器；4) 通过迭代的活跃集合更新实现鲁棒控制器的优化。

Result: 在一个阶数约50、含43个不确定参数的卫星基准系统上应用，方法大幅优于单纯的Monte Carlo采样，能在标准笔记本上几分钟内检测到罕见的最坏情形，鲁棒控制器优化收敛到少于10个活跃配置。

Conclusion: 该框架在不确定性耦合与参数约束存在时，提供了一种可扩展且高效的最坏情形搜索与鲁棒控制器设计方法，弥补了传统方法在高维参数空间的不足；但对全局最优性的形式保证仍缺失，需要在具体场景下权衡收敛性与最优性。

Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate -- based on the theory of upper-C1 functions -- the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. Accordingly, we propose to explore the parametric space with either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization, and to subsequently perform local exploitation with Sequential Quadratic Programming to compute Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: as in the state-of-art algorithm for standard robust control, identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. We show that the proposed method largely outperforms Monte-Carlo sampling alone, is able to reliably detect even rare worst-case configurations in minutes on a standard laptop, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations. Even in the unconstrained case, the proposed framework complements traditional methods, as it scales to plants with many parameters and states and explores the entire parametric space, albeit without formal guarantees of global optimality.

Abstract: There is already a method known from the literature with which it is possible to measure both the transfer function and the noise power spectral density of the superimposed noise at the output of a disturbed, time-invariant, real system with nonlinearities in one measurement. By using a suitable window, the frequency selectivity of the measurement of the power spectral density of the superimposed noise can be noticeably improved without significantly increasing the computational complexity of the method. The unbiasedness and consistency of the measurement method with a suitable window are proven. The measurement of the power spectral density of a zero-mean, stationary process without measuring the transfer function is investigated as a special case for both real-valued and complex-valued signals. It is derived which requirements a suitable window should meet and how it can be calculated with high numerical accuracy.

Abstract: The method described in the first part for frequency-selectively measuring the transfer function and the noise power spectral density of the superimposed noise at the output of a disturbed, real system with nonlinearities using windowing was limited to time-invariant systems with stationary and zero-mean processes. Here, we investigate how this measurement method can be extended so that all correlations existing between the input and output signals can also be measured using windowing for a periodically time-varying system disturbed by a cyclostationary noise process. An extended version of the window construction algorithm presented in the first part is introduced, in which some degrees of freedom not used there can be used to appropriately influence the properties of the window sequence depending on the application.

Abstract: Precise modeling of channel multipath is essential for understanding wireless propagation environments and optimizing communication systems. In particular, sixth-generation (6G) artificial intelligence (AI)-native communication systems demand massive and high-quality multipath channel data to enable intelligent model training and performance optimization. In this paper, we propose a wireless channel foundation model (WiCo) for multipath generation (WiCo-MG) via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To provide a solid training foundation for WiCo-MG, a new synthetic intelligent sensing-communication dataset for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-ground (U2G) communications is constructed. To overcome the challenges of cross-modal alignment and mapping, a two-stage training framework is proposed. In the first stage, sensing images are embedded into discrete-continuous SoM feature spaces, and multipath maps are embedded into a sensing-initialized discrete SoM space to align the representations. In the second stage, a mixture of shared and routed experts (S-R MoE) Transformer with frequency-aware expert routing learns the mapping from sensing to channel SoM feature spaces, enabling decoupled and adaptive multipath generation. Experimental results demonstrate that WiCo-MG achieves state-of-the-art in-distribution generation performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization, reducing NMSE by more than 2.59 dB over baselines, while exhibiting strong scalability in model and dataset growth and extensibility to new multipath parameters and tasks. Owing to higher accuracy, stronger generalization, and better scalability, WiCo-MG is expected to enable massive and high-fidelity channel data generation for the development of 6G AI-native communication systems.

TL;DR: 提出两层可移动天线（TL-MA）阵列，通过大尺度子阵移动与小尺度子阵内追加微调实现滑动成本下降，同时保持接收端波束和总速率的竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可移动天线（MA）多为单层逐个单元移动（SL-MA），尽管提升自由度，但控制复杂度和硬件成本高，难以在实际中落地。需要降低总移动距离（硬件驱动成本）而不显著损失速率。

Method: 建立以最大化系统和率为目标的优化模型，联合优化子阵位置、各子阵内相对MA位置及接收端波束形成。采用交替优化（AO）+ 粒子群优化（PSO）求解，迭代地优化子阵位置与子阵内MA位置，给定接收端波束。

Result: 与传统的逐个单元移动的SL-MA相比，TL-MA显著降低MA马达的总移动距离，同时在比对场景下达到相近的和速率性能。数值结果验证了方案的有效性。

Conclusion: 两层MA结构通过耦合的大尺度子阵移动与小尺度微调，实现了显著降低运动成本的同时维持竞争力的传输速率，AO-PSO算法为该类联合优化提供了有效求解路径。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology for improving the performance of wireless communication systems by providing new degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization. However, existing works on MA systems have mostly considered element-wise single-layer MA (SL-MA) arrays, where all the MAs move within the given movable region, hence inevitably incurring high control complexity and hardware cost in practice. To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new two-layer MA array (TL-MA), where the positions of MAs are jointly determined by the large-scale movement of multiple subarrays and the small-scale fine-tuning of per-subarray MAs. In particular, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum-rate of the TL-MA-aided communication system by jointly optimizing the subarray-positions, per-subarray (relative) MA positions, and receive beamforming. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which alternately optimizes the positions of subarrays and per-subarray MAs, given the optimal receive beamforming. Numerical results verify that the proposed TL-MA significantly reduces the sum-displacement of MA motors (i.e., the total moving distances of all motors) of element-wise SL-MA, while achieving comparable rate performance.

TL;DR: BD-RISs with non-diagonal scattering matrices enable enhanced channel control, significantly improving PLS in MIMO systems compared to conventional RIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RISs use diagonal scattering matrices, limiting channel manipulation and secrecy-rate (SR) optimization. BD-RISs offer greater flexibility through inter-element connections, potentially boosting SR in MIMO systems with eavesdroppers.

Method: Formulate SR maximization as a non-convex joint optimization of transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection elements (REs) under power and structural constraints. Introduce an auxiliary variable to decouple BD-RIS constraints. Develop a low-complexity penalty product Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (P-PRCGD) algorithm by combining augmented Lagrangian (AL) with product manifold gradient descent (PMGD) to obtain a KKT solution.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate that BD-RIS-assisted systems significantly outperform conventional RIS-assisted systems in physical layer security performance (higher secrecy rate).

Conclusion: BD-RISs provide substantial advantages for PLS due to enhanced channel shaping; the proposed P-PRCGD algorithm offers an effective, low-complexity solution to the non-convex joint optimization problem.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) hold significant promise for enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional RISs are typically modeled using diagonal scattering matrices, capturing only independent reflections from each reflecting element, which limits their flexibility in channel manipulation. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) employ non-diagonal scattering matrices enabled by active and tunable inter-element connections through a shared impedance network. This architecture significantly enhances channel shaping capabilities, creating new opportunities for advanced PLS techniques. This paper investigates PLS in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by BD-RISs, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends confidential information to a multi-antenna legitimate user while a multi-antenna eavesdropper attempts interception. To maximize the secrecy rate (SR), we formulate it as a non-convex optimization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS REs under power and structural constraints. To solve this problem, we first introduce an auxiliary variable to decouple BD-RIS constraints. We then propose a low-complexity penalty product Riemannian conjugate gradient descent (P-PRCGD) method, which combines the augmented Lagrangian (AL) approach with the product manifold gradient descent (PMGD) method to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Simulation results confirm that BD-RIS-assisted systems significantly outperform conventional RIS-assisted systems in PLS performance.

TL;DR: 在IRS辅助通信系统中，研究在常模仠性的CMAB下联合设计发射端和IRS相移以最大化保密速率，提出两种算法解决非凸SRM问题：时间高效的Dinkelbach-BSUM和在乘积流形上的共轭梯度下降PMCGD，并通过仿真验证各自优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理层安全（PLS）在无线通信中保护隐私和安全具有重要意义；大规模天线阵列和IRS的结合虽提升性能，但硬件成本与功耗高，因此需要低成本的CMAB等方案。在IRS辅助系统中，如何在有限模下高效提高保密速率成为关键研究问题。

Method: 建立CMAB发射和IRS相位移的SRM模型，将分数型目标通过Dinkelbach方法转化为序列的二次规划，并用BSUM求解；同时将问题映射到乘积流形上的无约束优化，使用共轭梯度下降在Riemannian乘积流形上求解，得到PMCGD解。

Result: 仿真结果表明两种算法均有效收敛，Dinkelbach-BSUM具备更低的计算时间开销（时间效率高），而PMCGD在求解精度方面可获得更优的保密速率，但计算时间略高。

Conclusion: 本文提出两种在CMAB–IRS场景下求解SRM的有效算法，满足成本受限的PLS设计需求；为权衡计算复杂度与性能，提供了有价值的设计选择。

Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is an important technology in wireless communication systems to safeguard communication privacy and security between transmitters and legitimate users. The integration of large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance PLS. However, LSAA requires a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna element, and IRS comprises hundreds of reflecting micro-antennas, leading to increased hardware costs and power consumption. To address this, cost-effective solutions like constant modulus analog beamforming (CMAB) have gained attention. This paper investigates PLS in IRS-assisted communication systems with a focus on jointly designing the CMAB at the transmitter and phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. The resulting secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is non-convex. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms: (1) the time-efficient Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm, which reformulates the fractional problem into a series of quadratic programs using the Dinkelbach method and solves them via block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM), and (2) the product manifold conjugate gradient descent (PMCGD) algorithm, which provides a better solution at the cost of slightly higher computational time by transforming the problem into an unconstrained optimization on a Riemannian product manifold and solving it using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and highlight their distinct advantages.

Conclusion: 在AB系统中引入MA可显著提升物理层安全性；所提出的PPM与PCGD算法为求解该非凸优化问题提供了有效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) are a novel technology that allows for the flexible adjustment of antenna positions within a specified region, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the use of MA to improve physical layer security in an analog beamforming (AB) communication system. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the transmit AB and MA position, subject to constant modulus (CM) constraints on the AB and position constraints for the MA. The resulting problem is non-convex, and we propose a penalty product manifold (PPM) method to solve it efficiently. Specifically, we convert the inequality constraints related to MA position into a penalty function using smoothing techniques, thereby reformulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization on the product manifold space (PMS). We then derive a parallel conjugate gradient descent (PCGD) algorithm to update both the AB and MA position on the PMS. This method is efficient, providing an analytical solution at each step and ensuring convergence to a KKT point. Simulation results show that the MA system achieves a higher secrecy rate than systems with fixed-position antennas.

Abstract: In this letter, we propose an efficient mix source separation algorithm for collision resolution in radio frequency identification (RFID) systems equipped with an antenna array at the reader. We first introduce an approach that exploits the zero constant modulus (ZCM) criterion to separate colliding tags through gradient descent, without using pilot symbols. We show that the ZCM characteristic, considered alone, in the design of the objective function can lead to significant ambiguities in the determination of the beamformers used in the recovery of tag messages. To address this limitation, we propose a more sophisticated approach, relying on a hybrid objective function, incorporating a new ambiguity-raising criterion in addition to the ZCM criterion.

Abstract: We consider uncoordinated random uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems using a set of predetermined power levels. We propose to optimize the probabilities of selection of power levels in order to minimize performance metrics as block error probability (BLEP) or bit error probability (BEP). When the multiuser detection algorithm at the BS treats at most two colliding users' packets, our optimization problem is a quadratic programming problem. For more colliding users' packets, we solve the problem iteratively. Our solution is original because it applies to any multiuser detection algorithm and any set of power levels.

Conclusion: 多模态 WFMs 能支持更广泛的无线任务与场景，成为 AI-native 6G 与感知-通信-定位融合愿景的重要一步。

Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.

Abstract: Orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for ensuring reliable communications in doubly-selective channels. This work investigates the spectra and orthogonality characteristics of analog (direct) and approximate digital implementations of ODDM systems. We first determine the time and frequency domain representations of the basis functions for waveform in analog and approximate digital ODDM systems. Thereafter, we derive their power spectral densities and show that while the spectrum of analog ODDM waveforms exhibits a step-wise behavior in its transition regions, the spectrum of approximate digital ODDM waveforms is confined to that of the ODDM sub-pulse. Next, we prove the orthogonality characteristics of approximate digital ODDM waveforms and show that, unlike analog ODDM waveforms, the approximate digital ODDM waveforms satisfy orthogonality without the need of additional time domain resources. Additionally, we examine the similarities and differences that implementations of approximate digital ODDM share with the other variants of DD modulations, focusing on the domain changes the symbols undergo, the type of pulse shaping and windowing used, and the domains and the sequence in which they are performed. Finally, we present numerical results to validate our findings and draw further insights.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) diagnoses and manages a wide range of diseases, yet long scan times drive high costs and limit accessibility. AI methods have demonstrated substantial potential for reducing scan times, but despite rapid progress, clinical translation of AI often fails. One particular class of failure modes, referred to as implicit data crimes, are a result of hidden biases introduced when MRI datasets incompletely model the MRI physics of the acquisition. Previous work identified data crimes resulting from algorithmic completion of k-space with parallel imaging and drew on simulation to demonstrate the resulting downstream biases. This work proposes a mathematical framework to re-characterize the problem as one of error reduction during interpolation between sets of evaluation coordinates. We establish a generalized matrix-based definition of the reconstruction error upper bound as a function of the input sampling pattern. Experiments on relevant sampling pattern structures demonstrate the relevance of the framework and suggest future directions for analysis of data crimes.

Abstract: We present an approach for spatially-consistent semi-deterministic Air-to-Ground (A2G) channel modeling in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted networks. We use efficient 3D building shadow projections to determine Line-of-Sight (LOS) regions, enabling fast generation of LOS maps. By integrating LOS-aware deterministic path loss with stochastic shadow fading, the approach produces spatially consistent A2G radio maps suitable for environment- and mobility-aware channel evaluation and performance prediction. Simulation results in ITU-compliant Manhattan grid environments demonstrate the model's ability to reflect key urban propagation characteristics, such as LOS blockage patterns and outage behavior. The proposed approach provides an efficient alternative to ray tracing or fully stochastic models, with particular relevance for user mobility, link planning, and radio map generation in 6G non-terrestrial networks.

Abstract: Sensing in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) is one of the major challenges for integrated sensing and communication systems. Existing countermeasures for NLOS either use prior knowledge on the environment to characterize all the multiple bounces or deploy anomalous reflectors in the environment to enable communication infrastructure to ''\textit{see behind the corner}''. This work addresses the integration of monostatic NLOS imaging functionalities into the initial access (IA) procedure of a next generation base station (BS), by means of a non-reconfigurable modular reflector. During standard-compliant IA, the BS sweeps a narrow beam using a pre-defined dedicated codebook to achieve the beam alignment with users. We introduce the imaging functionality by enhancing such codebook with imaging-specific entries that are jointly designed with the angular configuration of the modular reflector to enable high-resolution imaging of a region in NLOS by \textit{coherently} processing all the echoes at the BS. We derive closed-form expressions for the near-field (NF) spatial resolution, as well as for the \textit{effective aperture} (i.e., the portion of the reflector that actively contributes to improve image resolution). The problem of imaging of moving targets in NLOS is also addressed, and we propose a maximum-likelihood estimation for target's velocity in NF and related theoretical bound. Further, we discuss and quantify the inherent communication-imaging performance trade-offs and related system design challenges through numerical simulations. Finally, the proposed imaging method employing modular reflectors is validated both numerically and experimentally, showing the effectiveness of our concept.

Motivation: 现有物理层安全中的无线指纹识别易受接收机差异和信道变动影响，导致跨接收机测试的分类性能下降，需提出接收机无关且信道鲁棒的RFF提取方案。

Method: 平坦衰落情形下，利用未知设备的L-STF/L-LTF在频域上除以参考设备的相应字段；频率选择性衰落情形下，HT-LTF在频域上除以L-LTF；以上在单接收机训练的前提下提取高维RFF特征，使特征具备较强的通道不变性和接收机无关性。

Result: 通过仿真与实验验证，该方法显著缓解信道和接收机差异对RFF的影响，在单接收机训练且测试在不同接收机的条件下，分类准确率分别在平坦衰落和频率选择性衰落场景下较 state-of-the-art 提升了约15.5%和28.45%。

Conclusion: 分割法在频域对前导字段进行比值处理，能有效提取更具鲁棒性的高维RFF特征，提升跨接收机和跨信道的识别性能，且实现了对单接收机训练的要求。

Abstract: In physical-layer security schemes, radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification of WiFi devices is susceptible to receiver differences, which can significantly degrade classification performance when a model is trained on one receiver but tested on another. In this paper, we propose a division-based receiver-agnostic RFF extraction method for WiFi systems, which removes the receivers' effects by dividing different preambles in the frequency domain. The proposed method requires only a single receiver for training and does not rely on additional calibration or stacking processes. First, for flat fading channel scenarios, the legacy short training field (L-STF) and legacy long training field (L-LTF) of the unknown device are divided by those of the reference device in the frequency domain. The receiver-dependent effects can be eliminated with the requirement of only a single receiver for training, and the higher-dimensional RFF features can be extracted. Second, for frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, the high-throughput long training field (HT-LTF) is divided by the L-LTF in the frequency domain. Only a single receiver is required for training and the higher-dimensional RFF features that are both channel-invariant and receiver-agnostic are extracted. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigate the impacts of channel variations and receiver differences. The classification results show that, even when training on a single receiver and testing on a different one, the proposed method achieves classification accuracy improvements of 15.5% and 28.45% over the state-of-the-art approach in flat fading and frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, respectively.
