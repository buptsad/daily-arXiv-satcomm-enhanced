The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class."}

This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in PASS. The fundamental principles of PASS are first discussed, including its hardware architecture, circuit and physical models, and signal models. Several emerging PASS designs, such as segmented PASS (S-PASS), center-fed PASS (C-PASS), and multi-mode PASS (M-PASS), are subsequently introduced, and their design features are discussed. In addition, the properties and promising applications of PASS for wireless sensing are reviewed. On this basis, recent progress in the performance analysis of PASS for both communications and sensing is surveyed, and the performance gains achieved by PASS are highlighted. Existing research contributions in optimization and machine learning are also summarized, with the practical challenges of beamforming and resource allocation being identified in relation to the unique transmission structure and propagation characteristics of PASS.

Code repository: https://github.com/researchaudio/canarybench", "summary": "Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.\n  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings (\"canaries\") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.\n  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy. We position this work as a societal impacts contribution centered on privacy risk measurement for published analytics artifacts rather than raw user data."}

The system is fabricated via a two step additive manufacturing process that enables sealed CPCM encapsulation and isolated liquid cooling pathways within a single carbon fiber reinforced nylon module, effectively eliminating leakage risks while allowing precise geometric control. Hexagonally partitioned CPCM cavities maximize the CPCM wall interfacial area and shorten internal conduction paths, accelerating latent heat absorption, while embedded serpentine liquid channels provide continuous convective heat removal and prevent CPCM saturation.

These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another."}

While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication."}

However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy.

Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation."}

This paper proposes a resource-centric definition of efficiency, isolating the hardware cost required to maintain a non-blocking throughput constraint.

We conclude that while high-radix direct networks optimize efficiency at small to medium scales, indirect networks (e.g., Fat Trees) are required to cap router complexity at massive scales. Furthermore, we posit that redundancy is most efficiently handled via parallel network instances (e.g., multi-plane Star networks) rather than intrinsic topological path diversity."}

While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols."}

Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss."}

LLM inputs are an unbounded, unstructured space. Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them."}

This paper introduces \\emph{topological secure aggregation} (TSA), which studies one-shot, information-theoretically secure aggregation of neighboring users' inputs over arbitrary network topologies. We develop a unified linear design framework that characterizes TSA achievability through the spectral properties of the communication graph, specifically the kernel of a diagonally modulated adjacency matrix. For several representative classes of $d$-regular graphs including ring, prism and complete topologies, we establish the optimal communication and secret key rate region.

A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification", "comment": "17 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment."}

Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations."}

In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination."}

This article tackles this geometric bottleneck by integrating movable antenna systems (MAS) at the transceiver side. MAS provides real-time, controllable spatial degrees of freedom through sub-wavelength antenna repositioning, enabling active reconfiguration of the cascaded channel without modifying passive tags or consuming additional spectrum. We position this solution within a unified ISAC-backscatter communication-B-ISAC evolution, describe the resulting MAS-assisted B-ISAC architecture and operating principles, and demonstrate its system-level gains through comparative analysis and numerical results.

To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence.

Some mitigation strategies against these attacks do exist, but they are not as far-reaching or as efficient as the CHERI architecture. CHERI uses capabilities to restrict pointers to certain regions of memory and with certain access restrictions. These capabilities are also used to implement \"compartmentalisation\": dividing a binary into smaller components with limited privilege, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. However, while this architecture successfully mitigates memory corruption attacks, the compartmentalisation mechanisms in place are less effective in containing malicious code to a separate compartment. This paper details four ways to bypass compartmentalisation, with a focus on Linux and BSD operating systems ported to this architecture. We find that although compartmentalisation is implemented in these two operating systems, simple bugs and attacks can still allow malicious code to bypass it. We conclude with mitigation measures to prevent these attacks, a proof-of-concept demonstrating their use, and recommendations for further securing Linux and BSD against unknown attacks."}

Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs.

The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles.

Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior.

By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration.

Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines.

The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019."}

However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods. This work establishes a foundation for next-generation wireless networks by integrating perception, interaction, and communication through holistic radiation field reconstruction."}

Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization.

In centralized operation, channel estimation and data decoding are performed at the central processing unit (CPU), whereas in distributed operation, channel estimation occurs at the APs and data detection at the CPU. In this paper, we propose a novel uplink operation, termed Master-Assisted Distributed Uplink Operation (MADUO), where each UE is assigned a master AP, which receives soft data estimates from the other APs and decodes the data using its local signals and the received data estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed operation performs comparably to the centralized operation and balances fronthaul signaling and computational complexity."}

A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure."}

Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty."}

Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \\textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms."}

Existing topology control methods rely on global optimization to produce a single optimal topology or involve high computational complexity, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity.

In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes."}

This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation.

We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure.

Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them.

Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means)."}

The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples."}

Technical report/winner report for the VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge (2025)", "summary": "Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints."}

We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance."}

This also applies if the same addresses are used in different cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, cross-chain address reuse appears to be a recurring phenomenon, especially in EVM-based designs. Previous works performed either direct address matching, or basic format conversion, to identify such cases. However, seemingly incompatible address formats e.g., in Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be derived from the same public keys, since they rely on the same cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we therefore focus on the underlying public keys to discover reuse within, as well as across, different cryptocurrency networks, enabling us to also match incompatible address formats. Specifically, we analyze key reuse across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash and Tron. Our results reveal that cryptographic keys are extensively and actively reused across these networks, negatively impacting both privacy and security of their users. We are hence the first to expose and quantify cross-chain key reuse between UTXO and account-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we devise novel clustering methods across these different cryptocurrency networks that do not rely on heuristics and instead link entities by their knowledge of the underlying secret key."}

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned."}

First, we extend a formal model of optimal front- and back-run sizing, relating attack profitability to victim trade volume, liquidity depth, and slippage bounds. We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies."}

We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions. Our new algorithm solves this learning problem via several non-trivial developments, including a carefully designed dual feedback that returns the budget multiplier as sensitivity information for the upper-level update and a lower level that solves a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem via an extended occupancy-measure linear program.

Traditional knowledge-based authentication remains rigid, requiring exact word-for-word string matches that fail to accommodate natural human memory and linguistic variation. Meanwhile, fraud-detection pipelines struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving scam behaviors, leading to high false-positive rates and frequent retraining cycles required. This work introduces two complementary LLM-enabled solutions, namely, an LLM-assisted authentication mechanism that evaluates semantic correctness rather than exact wording, supported by document segmentation and a hybrid scoring method combining LLM judgement with cosine-similarity metrics and a RAG-based fraud-detection pipeline that grounds LLM reasoning in curated evidence to reduce hallucinations and adapt to emerging scam patterns without model retraining. Experiments show that the authentication system accepts 99.5% of legitimate non-exact answers while maintaining a 0,1% false-acceptance rate, and that the RAG-enhanced fraud detection reduces false positives from 17.2% to 35%. Together, these findings demonstrate that LLMs can significantly improve both usability and robustness in security workflows, offering a more adaptive , explainable, and human-aligned approach to authentication and fraud detection."}

In order to avoid this issue, this paper proposes an improved initialization for port-Hamiltonian neural networks. The core idea is to first estimate a linear port-Hamiltonian system to be used as an initialization for the network, after which the neural network adapts to the system nonlinearities, reducing the training times and improving convergence. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a chained mass-spring-damper setup for varying noise levels and compared to the original approach."}

Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \\emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances.

By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees.

However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols."}

As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems.

Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles."}

While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables \"self-optimizing\" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments."}

The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting."}

Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment."}

However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment.

Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations."}

In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \\textrm{Evaluation error} \\le \\textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.\n  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE."}

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks."}

While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings."}

OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types.

This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs.

This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models."}

In this work, we present \\emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts."}

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection."}

Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications."}

Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability.

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%."}

For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.\n  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality."}

In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks.

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$.

In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold.

Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs.

However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains.

These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization."}

To this end, we present a framework harnessing Universal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as evolving semantic gatekeepers. We introduce PRISM (Prototype Refinement & Inspection via Statistical Monitoring), which overcomes the domain gap of general VLMs through two key mechanisms: a Hybrid VLM Teacher that dynamically refines visual prototypes online, and an Adaptive Router powered by statistical margin monitoring to calibrate gating thresholds in real-time. Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrates that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance, suppressing Attack Success Rate to <1% on CIFAR-10 while improving clean accuracy, establishing a new standard for model-agnostic, externalized security."}

The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation.

We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications.

We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry."}

Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline."}

By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying \"uniformity\" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment."}

MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks."}

For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks."}

We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks.

We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets.

To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks."}

A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction."}

This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?\n  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class.

We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches."}

Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the \"grokking time\") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks.

Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures.

To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE).

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework.

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size.

We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom.

Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN.

While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset.

We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples."}

Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means)."}

We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting."}
