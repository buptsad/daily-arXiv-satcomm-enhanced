However, the performance of\ninter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While\npointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness\nof PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment\nhardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge,\nthis paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO\ncommunication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and\nmisalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation\nwith a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with\nguaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis\nmore practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo\nsimulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite\nFSO systems in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684\u661f\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u94fe\u8def\uff08ISL FSO\uff09\u4fe1\u9053\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0fCDF\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u65adCDF\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97 outage \u6982\u7387\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u9519\u4f4d\u6781\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\uff0cPAA\u8865\u507f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u9ad8\u7aef\u5bf9\u51c6\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u53ef\u603b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u3001\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u9519\u4f4d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684 FSO \u4fe1\u9053CDF\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u622a\u65ad\u7684CDF\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97 outage \u6982\u7387\uff1b\u5e76\u4ee5\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u543b\u5408\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u622a\u65adCDF+\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97 outage \u6982\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u661f\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5728\u8003\u8651\u6ce2\u675f\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u661f\u95f4 FSO \u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

Hence, the value of the gas fire power plant is\nidentical to the value of a spark spread option wherein the underlying are\nelectricity and gas with a strike price assimilated to operating and\nmaintenance costs. Power and fuels spot prices account for uncertain futures\ncash-flows for power-plant generator owners. For instance, for gas-fired\nturbine plant, spot prices of electricity and gas determine the random\ncash-flows of the power-plant. Other than the spot prices, the valuation of\nsuch plant involves among other deterministic cost the plant heat rate and\noperating costs. Recently, the cost of emissions is considered into the\nvaluation to tackle environmental issues. Given some simplifications in the\nplant cash-flow modelling, the value of such plant can either be expressed as\nthe price of i) a cross-commodity option or ii) the price of a real option.\nHere, we focus on cross-commodity option valuation approach where the value of\nthe power plant is approached as the value of a spark spread option. When spot\nprices of the underlying commodities are log-normal, closed formulae or\napproximations can be obtained using Kirk's approximation.

The\nproposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior\ninference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms\nbaselines in terms of channel estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u884c mmWave MIMO\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u884c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u975e\u7406\u6027\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51b2\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad(VI)\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u9053\u5728\u89d2\u57df\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c(MFA)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06VI\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60(SBL)\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u52a8\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u4e0b\u884cmmWave MIMO\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7684VI\u2011SBL\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

To mitigate terrain-induced LoS blockages that degrade\ndetection performance, we incorporate a binary LoS indicator and propose a\nbounding volume hierarchy (BHV)-based adaptive scheme for efficient LoS\nevaluation. We formulate a bi-objective problem that maximizes the probability\nof cooperative detection with minimal hover energy constraints governing\nspatial, orientational, and safety constraints. To address the problem, which\nis inherently non-convex, we propose a hierarchical heuristic framework that\ncombines exploration through a genetic algorithm (GA) with per-UAV refinement\nvia particle swarm optimization (PSO), where a penalty-based fitness evaluation\nguides solutions toward feasibility, bounded within constraints. The proposed\nmethodology is an effective trade-off method of traversing through a complex\nsearch space and maintaining terrain-aware LoS connectivity and energy aware\ndeployment. Monte Carlo simulations on real-world terrain data show that the\nproposed GA+PSO framework improves detection probability by 37.02% and 36.5%\nfor 2 and 3 UAVs, respectively, while reducing average excess hover energy by\n45.0% and 48.9% compared to the PSO-only baseline. Relative to the\nnon-optimized scheme, it further achieves 59.5% and 54.2% higher detection\nprobability with 59.8% and 65.9% lower excess hover energy, thereby showing its\neffectiveness with a small number of UAVs over uneven terrain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5(GA)\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316(PSO)\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0 terrain-aware LoS \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u60ac\u505c\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u5f62\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\u963b\u6321\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u611f\u77e5LoS\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u5c55BHV-based\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5f62\u89c6\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4e8c\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ee5GA\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u4ee5PSO\u5bf9\u6bcf\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u5316\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cGA+PSO\u6846\u67b6\u57282\u548c3\u67b6UAV\u65f6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534737.02%\u4e0e36.5%\uff0c\u60ac\u505c\u80fd\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u8d85\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d45.0%\u4e0e48.9%\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8ePSO-alone\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u76f8\u5bf9\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u518d\u63d0\u534759.5%\u4e0e54.2%\uff0c\u60ac\u505c\u80fd\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e59.8%\u4e0e65.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5730\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u7684LoS\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u5c11UAV\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Currently, control systems that attempt\nto compensate for road grade are designed with one of two assumptions. Either\nthe grade is only known once the vehicle is driving over the road segment\nthrough proprioception, or complete knowledge of the oncoming road grade is\nknown from a pre-made map. Both assumptions limit the performance of a control\nsystem, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation,\nwhereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to\nmissing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the\noncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use\npoint returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint\nalong a path. The estimated grade is defined as the difference in height\nbetween the front and rear wheelbase at a given waypoint. Kalman filtering\ntechniques are used to mitigate the effects of odometry and motion uncertainty\non the grade estimates. This estimator's performance is compared to the\nmeasurements of a map created with a GNSS/INS system via a field experiment.\nWhen compared to the map-based system, the lidar-based estimator produces an\nunbiased error with a standard deviation of 0.6 degrees at an average range of\n52.7 meters. By having similar precision to map-based systems, automotive\nlidar-based grade estimation systems are shown to be a valid approach for\nmeasuring road grade when a map is unavailable or inaccurate.

Motivated by safety considerations,\nthe first type of constraint enforces a control-invariant set, while the second\ntype could represent a less restrictive constraint on the system state. This\ndistinction enables closed-loop sub- optimality results for nonlinear MPC with\nheterogeneous state constraints (distinct constraints across open loop\npredicted states), and no terminal elements. Removing the non-invariant\nconstraint recovers the partially constrained case. Beyond its theoretical\ninterest, heterogeneous constrained MPC shows how constraint choices shape the\nsystem's closed loop. In the partially constrained case, adjusting the\nconstraint horizon (how many predicted- state constraints are enforced) trades\nestimation accuracy for computational cost. Our analysis yields first, a sub-\noptimality upper-bound accounting for distinct constraint sets, their horizons\nand decay rates, that is tighter for short horizons than prior work.

Inspired by the\nadvancements in recent work of distributed data plane verification and the\nresemblance be- tween the data plane and DNS configuration, we tackle the\nchallenge of DNS misconfiguration by introducing Janus, a DNS verification\ntool. Our key insight is that the process of a nameserver handling queries can\nbe transformed into a matching process on a match-action table. With this\ninsight, Janus consists of (1) an efficient data structure for partition query\nspace based on the behaviors, (2) a symbolic execution algorithm that specifies\nhow a single nameserver can efficiently cover all possible queries and ensure\nthe accuracy of verification, (3) a mechanism to support incremental\nverification with less computational effort. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets (with over 6 million resource records) show that Janus\nachieves significant speedups, with peak improvements of up to 255.7x and a\nmaximum 6046x reduction in the number of LECs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Janus \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e DNS \u914d\u7f6e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u540d\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5904\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5339\u914d-\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 DNS \u914d\u7f6e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u5bf9\u589e\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u540d\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5904\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5339\u914d-\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u4e0a\u7684\u5339\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u6765\u8986\u76d6\u5355\u4e2a\u540d\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc7\u516d\u767e\u4e07\u6761\u8d44\u6e90\u8bb0\u5f55\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cJanus \u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe\u5230 255.7x\uff0cLECs \u6570\u91cf\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11 6046x\u3002", "conclusion": "Janus \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 DNS misconfiguration \u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u589e\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As a promising\ndirection, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an\nefficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is\ncritically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper\nselection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur\nsignificant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To\naddress this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that\nintegrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density\nEstimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first\nemploys a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral\ndistribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is\napplied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine\nproper integration contours.

However, deriving accurate yet tractable performance\nexpressions under fully correlated fading remains challenging, primarily due to\nthe absence of a closed-form distribution for the FAS channel. To address this\ngap, this paper develops a novel performance evaluation framework for FAS\noperating under fully correlated Rayleigh fading, by modeling the FAS channel\nthrough extreme value distributions (EVDs). We first justify the suitability of\nEVD modeling and approximate the FAS channel through the Gumbel distribution,\nwith parameters expressed as functions of the number of ports and the antenna\naperture size via the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion.

Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have\nrecently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak\nstrategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract\nvaluable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and\ncontains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient\nstrategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and\nmodular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that\nautonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve\nmore efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we\ndesign a closed-loop \"attack-evaluate-distill-reuse\" core mechanism that not\nonly generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes\nreusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate\nand apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library\nthat categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on\ntheir performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise\nguidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and\ntransferability.

The current supervised\nfine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets\nto train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize\neffectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,\nreinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and\ngeneralization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure\nRL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and\nenhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic\ngeneralization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively\nshifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on\nthis design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models.

We aim to minimize the\naverage transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal\nsource coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission\nduration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission\nduration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark\npolicies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy.

An attacker\ncontrolling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them\nwithin ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work\ninvestigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and,\nmore broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We\nformalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification\nframework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify\nthe trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we\ncharacterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference\nand introduce two practical estimators for them.

Current treatments offer only\nlimited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the\nneed for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,\nheterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear\ndefinition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering\nmethods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a\nclustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression\ndeclarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple\ndescriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such\nvariables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a\nweak-supervised learning method.

Classical deep generative models often struggle to\ncapture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or\nproducing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the\nQuantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework\nthat integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.\nThe framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that\njointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)\nquantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and\nmitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical\nparameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are\noptimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic\nGaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and\nprotein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by\nup to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),\nwhile improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration.

Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31\nparameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate\nContour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the\nanalysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all\nfeature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between\nBaseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or\nFog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of\n13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced\ndifferences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze\nstability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as\nMean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index\n(GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the\nBCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye\nmovement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other\nparameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of\nsaccades: Cliff's $\\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and\nstandard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring\nthe influence of reduced visibility on visual attention.

These signals are\nused in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.\nHowever, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise\nsources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is\nproper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As\na means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP\npreprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness\nand reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to\nmitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The\npipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and\nline noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an\nefficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection\nbased on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to\nensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the\ncleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.\nNeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,\nin the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%\naccuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic\nRegression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which\nperformed at 74% accuracy.

First, we demonstrate the unique challenges encountered in this\ncollaborative system, i.e., the coupling and heterogeneity of the UAV/USV's\ntrajectories. Then, we formulate a total energy consumption minimization\nproblem to jointly optimize the trajectories, flying and hovering times, target\nscheduling, and beamformers under the constraints of water currents, collision\navoidance, and Sensing and Communication (S\\&C) requirements. To address the\nstrong coupling of the variables, we divide the original problem into two\nsubproblems, namely, the hover point selection and the joint trajectory\nplanning and beamforming design. In the first subproblem, we propose a\nthree-step hierarchical method including: (1) a virtual base station coverage\n(VBSC) and clustering algorithm to obtain the target scheduling and rough\nposition of hover points; (2) a Bi-traveling salesman problem with neighborhood\n(Bi-TSPN)-based algorithm to determine the visiting order sequence of the hover\npoints; (3) a hover point refinement and time allocation algorithm to further\noptimize the time allocation. In the latter subproblem, we complete the\nremaining trajectory planning and beamforming design in each flying and\nhovering stage by developing a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive\nconvex approximation (SCA) method.

Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via\nlinear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow\nmisalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results\nindicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of\nshared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized\ninto specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this\nfundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we\nhope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability\nand weight-based interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "EM shows cross-task linear structure: harmful behavior aligns along common weight-directions and persists under interpolation.", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a emergent misalignment \u7684\u6839\u672c\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a narrowly harmful \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u5dee\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c narrowly misalignment \u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d2\u503c\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684 broadly misaligned \u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "EM \u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u4e00\u7ec4\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and\nkernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of\nattention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.\nSupporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require\nspecialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently\naddressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support\nFlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.\n  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within\nthe PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style\nkernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static\ntemplates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's\ncompilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,\nenabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it\nsupport all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles\nmore general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the\ncapabilities of FlexAttention.\n  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or\nsuperior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native\nPyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models\nwithout sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Flashlight \u81ea\u52a8\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728 PyTorch \u751f\u6001\u5185\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5408\u7684 FlashAttention \u98ce\u683c\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e FlexAttention \u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6b8a\u5185\u6838\u3001\u624b\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5728 PyTorch \u7f16\u8bd1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u98ce\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5206\u5757\uff08tiling\uff09\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u65e2\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5185\u6838\u7279\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301 FlexAttention \u7684\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u6838\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e FlexAttention \u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u751f PyTorch \u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5feb\u901f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Flashlight \u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u7f16\u8bd1\u671f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728 PyTorch \u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which\nis restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of\ncomputational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication\nsystems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local\ninformation processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp\nis currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous\ndata-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is\nsusceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of\nthe ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with\nmultiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions.

We further examine how this robust loss\nreshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted\nisometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.\nThrough theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels\nat handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.\nThis work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine\nlearning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and\nbroadly applicable analytical framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u5728\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8eMSE\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u6d88\u9664\u4f2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6216\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u635f\u5931\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u666f\u89c2\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6838\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790RIP\u5e38\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4f2a\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u70b9\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u9c81\u68d2\u635f\u5931\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit\nbased spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features\nwith a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and\nseasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with\nlearnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and\namplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive\ndistributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and\ncalibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real\nworld datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing\nagainst five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction\naccuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate\nrobustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of\nextraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep\nlearning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in\nemerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa CGLUBNF \u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Fourier \u7279\u5f81\u3001\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u901a\u9053\u95e8\u63a7\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u5143\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u66f4\u9510\u5229\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u5e38\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u3001\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f3a\u5931\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u901a\u9053\u95e8\u63a7\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u5143\u57fa\u7840\u65f6\u7a7a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u573a\u6a21\u578b CGLUBNF\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u914d\u5408\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u95e8\u63a7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u901a\u9053\u95e8\u63a7\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u5143\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u7ec4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4e0e\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\uff0cCGLUBNF \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b horizon \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u5174\u4f20\u611f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5982\u8f66\u8f7d\u79fb\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Through online-to-batch\nconversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal\nuniversal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\\\"older smoothness.\nHowever, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more\nchallenging.

While linear preconditioners are often\nsufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has\nexplored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as\ncomponents of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical\nstudies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling\nefficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt\ntheir architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC\nsimilarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or\nsuperior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose\na factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by\ncombining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to\ntarget geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are\napproximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional\nNF models more complex dimensions.

However, existing GNNs exhibit poor\ngeneralization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in\ndynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent\nnon-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving\nGraph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware\ninvariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment\nsequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer\nthe underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for\nenvironment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address\nenvironmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we\nconduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture\nof instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish\nspatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in\nnon-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority\nof EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution\nshifts.

Many seminal models, such as\nTransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent\nlimitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.\nIn this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model\nthat challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a\ncompact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear\nSpherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as\na hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments\non three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate\nthat SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean\ncounterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237\nand CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior.

To address this, offline RL algorithms\ntypically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically\ncategorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show\nthat each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints\ntend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,\nthough least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior\npolicy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ\ndata quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood\nconstraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop\na simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning\n(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.\nEmpirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL\nbenchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited\ndata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u90bb\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6ANQ\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u5e76\u53d6\u5e76\u96c6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u548c\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u754c\u5b9a\u5916\u63a8\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u5efa\u6a21\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u534a\u5f84\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9-wise\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684ANQ\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u5916\u63a8\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u81ea\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u81ea\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u60c5\u5f62\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u5c3d\u7ba1\u66f4\u5c11\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f83\u5f3a\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u517c\u987e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a\u5c06Bellman\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u5e76\u96c6\u4e4b\u5185\u3002\u8be5\u7ea6\u675f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\u5b9a\u5916\u63a8\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff08\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u90bb\u57df\u534a\u5f84\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51c6\u5219\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ANQ\uff08Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u52a8\u4f5c\u6ee1\u8db3\u8be5\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884cQ-learning\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u90bb\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u540c\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u5916\u63a8\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0cANQ\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u72b6\u6001-of-the-art\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u90bb\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u652f\u6301\u3001\u6837\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u7684ANQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

A clipping function\nis introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio\nin these \"right\" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to\nextend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering\nthe clipping in the \"right\" direction regions. However, due to randomness in\nthe rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the\nratios frequently move to the \"wrong\" direction during the PPO optimization.\nThis is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely\noverlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm\n(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict \"wrong\"\ndirection regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance\nratio falls below (above) $1 - \\beta$ ($1+\\beta$),\n  for a tunable parameter $\\beta \\in (0, 1)$.

It had been previously\nobserved that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which\ncharacterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis\n(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered\nanalogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by\nintroducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the\nconnection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)\nclasses, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the\neffective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,\neven for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for\nvarious notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes\nsatisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that\nCPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that\nrealize the same samples.

We\nestablish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex\nand smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.\nExtensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and\ndemonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence\nspeed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL) \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 Nesterov \u52a8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5bb9\u9519\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u5149\u6ed1\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd Byzantine \u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6536\u655b/\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u6216\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u5982 Nesterov \u52a8\u91cf\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Byrd-NAFL\uff0c\u5c06 Nesterov \u52a8\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u88ab\u7be1\u6539\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u5149\u6ed1\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u505a\u51fa\u653e\u5bbd\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7ed9\u51fa Byrd-NAFL \u5728\u975e\u51f8\u3001\u5149\u6ed1\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u66f4\u52a0\u5bbd\u677e\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Byrd-NAFL \u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,\nConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.\nThis concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more\nlikely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that\nConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO.

In contrast, solo\nexperiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,\ncollaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock\ntheir potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that\ntransfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning.

We demonstrate positive returns\nwhen utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of\nmachine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ec4\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9 MLB \u6bd4\u8d5b\u8fdb\u884c\u80dc\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u80dc\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u80dc\u8d1f\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u5dee\u5206\u5f97\u5206\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c06\u80dc\u7387\u7528\u4e8e\u8d54\u7387\u4e0b\u6ce8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u9002\u7b56\u7565\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u76f2\u76ee\u5e94\u7528\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728 MLB \u7684\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8d5b\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80dc\u8005\u548c\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u80dc\u8d1f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6295\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u80dc\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5dee\u5206\u5f97\u5206\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u80dc\u8d1f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8dd1\u7ebf\u4e0b\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u80dc\u7387\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5408\u9002\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e naive \u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u5e38\u89c1\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u80dc\u7387\u4e0e\u80dc\u8d1f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u80dc\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u6b63\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u4ee5\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u76f2\u76ee\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u6ce8\u5219\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u80dc\u8d1f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5e76\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6070\u5f53\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u4e3a\u6295\u6ce8\u5e26\u6765\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5f53\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8f\u635f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

As the\nfoundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to\nsupport new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the\nmodels towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we\nintroduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a\nnew evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;\ngeneralization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to\nsatellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also\ndevelop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its\ncross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation\nmodels for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose\nmodels like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to\nnew satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in\nperformance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,\nthe performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\\% when given\nadditional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the\nlast linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get\nrelatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the\nbenchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the\ndatasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing\nmodels with stronger cross-satellite generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa GeoCrossBench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u536b\u661f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u5c55 ChiViT \u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7248\u672c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u536b\u661f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8c31\u5e26\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 GeoBench \u6269\u5c55\u4e3a GeoCrossBench\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u65e0\u8c31\u5e26\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u989d\u5916\u8c31\u5e26\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86 ChannelViT \u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6269\u5c55 ChiViT\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08DOFA\u3001TerraFM\u3001DINOv3\u3001ChiViT\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528 oracle \u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u8c03\u4ec5\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u536b\u661f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u5305\u62ec\uff1aDOFA\u3001TerraFM \u5728\u5c31\u5730\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4e0d\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b DINOv3\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u8c31\u5e26\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u8de8\u536b\u661f\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u51fa\u73b0 2\u20134 \u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cChiViT \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e DINOv3\uff1b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u8c31\u5e26\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d 5\u201325%\uff1b\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8c31\u5e26\u7684 oracle \u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8de8\u536b\u661f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u51c6\u5c1a\u672a\u9971\u548c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u8de8\u536b\u661f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
