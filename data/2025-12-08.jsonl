However, the existing architectures ignore the required number of epochs for training convergence and floating-point operations (FLOPs), which increase significantly with improving performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new residual network (ResNet) block design for OFDM NeuralRx. Specifically, we leverage small kernel sizes and dilation rates to lower the number of FLOPs (NFLOPs) and uniform channel sizes to reduce the memory access cost (MAC). The ResNet block is designed with novel channel split and shuffle blocks, element-wise additions are removed, with Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) activations. Extensive simulations show that our proposed NeuralRx reduces NFLOPs and improves training convergence while improving the decoding accuracy."}

This scarcity introduces epistemic uncertainty, i.e., reducible uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the underlying data distribution, which fundamentally limits predictive performance. This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data. Throughout, we take an information-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role of information measures in quantifying the impact of data scarcity."}

This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels which are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90% when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication."}

While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on four real-world, family-annotated datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings, we establish a robust baseline and provide practical insights into the most effective combinations of data abstractions, representation models, and learning paradigms for this challenge."}

MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research.

Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \\textbf{20.7\\%}, total revenue by up to \\textbf{36.2\\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \\textbf{22.1\\%}.

In this paper, we introduce an automated defense framework that leverages medium- to high-interaction honeypot telemetry to dynamically update firewall rules in real time. The framework integrates deception sensors (Cowrie), Azure-native automation tools (Monitor, Sentinel, Logic Apps), and MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detection within a closed-loop feedback mechanism. We developed a testbed to automatically observe adversary tactics, classify them using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and mitigate network-level threats automatically with minimal human intervention.\n  To assess the framework's effectiveness, we defined and applied a set of attack- and defense-oriented security metrics. Building on existing adaptive defense strategies, our solution extends automated capabilities into cloud-native environments. The experimental results show an average Mean Time to Block of 0.86 seconds - significantly faster than benchmark systems - while accurately classifying over 12,000 SSH attempts across multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics. These findings demonstrate that integrating deception telemetry with Azure-native automation reduces attacker dwell time, enhances SOC visibility, and provides a scalable, actionable defense model for modern cloud infrastructures."}

Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to play an integral role in these networks, offering versatile applications and flexible deployment options. However, accurately characterizing the shadow fading (SF) behavior in UAV communications remains a challenge. Traditional SF correlation models rely on spatial distance and neglect the UAV's 3D orientation and elevation angle. Yet even slight variations in pitch angle (5 to 10 degrees) can significantly affect the signal strength observed by a UAV. In this study, we investigate the impact of UAV pitch and elevation geometry on SF and propose an elevation- and tilt-aware spatial correlation model. We use a real-world fixed-altitude UAV measurement dataset collected in a rural environment at 3.32 GHz with a 125 kHz bandwidth. Results show that a 10-degree tilt-angle separation and a 20-degree elevation-angle separation can reduce the SF correlation by up to 15% and 40%, respectively. In addition, integrating the proposed correlation model into the ordinary Kriging (OK) framework for signal strength prediction yields an approximate 1.5 dB improvement in median RMSE relative to the traditional correlation model that ignores UAV orientation and elevation."}

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies.

Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters.

The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and highly coupled. To address it efficiently, we adopt a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework, decomposing it into three manageable subproblems. For each subproblem, closed-form solutions or efficient numerical algorithms are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint transceiver and APV design significantly reduces the MSE compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and exhibits enhanced robustness against hardware impairments. The effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm are further validated under various system configurations."}

As a result, genomic data vastly outpace available phenotypic labels, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised models. We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline. These findings demonstrate that integrating PLMs with SSL can address the antigenicity labeling bottleneck and enable more effective use of unlabeled surveillance sequences, supporting rapid variant prioritization and timely vaccine strain selection."}

Existing safety evaluation benchmarks and frameworks are often limited by an imbalanced integration of core components (attack, defense, and evaluation methods) and an isolation between flexible evaluation frameworks and standardized benchmarking capabilities. These limitations hinder reliable cross-study comparisons and create unnecessary overhead for comprehensive risk assessment. To address these gaps, we present TeleAI-Safety, a modular and reproducible framework coupled with a systematic benchmark for rigorous LLM safety evaluation. Our framework integrates a broad collection of 19 attack methods (including one self-developed method), 29 defense methods, and 19 evaluation methods (including one self-developed method). With a curated attack corpus of 342 samples spanning 12 distinct risk categories, the TeleAI-Safety benchmark conducts extensive evaluations across 14 target models. The results reveal systematic vulnerabilities and model-specific failure cases, highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and utility, and identifying potential defense patterns for future optimization. In practical scenarios, TeleAI-Safety can be flexibly adjusted with customized attack, defense, and evaluation combinations to meet specific demands.

By enabling interconnections between RIS elements, BD-RIS architectures offer greater flexibility in wave manipulation compared to traditional diagonal RIS designs. However, these interconnections introduce new research challenges for channel estimation, making existing approaches developed for conventional diagonal RISs ineffective and significantly increasing pilot overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individual channel estimation framework that separately estimates the BS-RIS channel, which typically remains static over time, and the RIS-user channels, which vary rapidly due to user mobility. Specifically, we develop a full-duplex (FD) approach to estimate the BS-RIS channel by leveraging its inherent sparsity. Following this, the RIS-user channels are estimated using a least squares (LS) approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly higher channel estimation accuracy, particularly when the number of RIS elements is large, while substantially reducing pilot overhead compared to conventional cascaded channel estimation methods."}

In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \\enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the \"deep\" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability \"harmful\" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability \"refusal\" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the \"gaming\" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO). Adding PRESTO yields up to a 4.7x improvement in the mean StrongREJECT score under RAP attacks across three popular open-source LLMs, with low impact to model utility."}

To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages.

Third, using an ethical proxy for CSAM (a child wearing glasses, hereafter, CWG), we show that even when only a small percentage of child images are left in the training dataset, there exist prompting strategies that generate CWG from a child-filtered T2I model using only a few more queries than when the model is trained on the unfiltered data. Fine-tuning the filtered model on child images further reduces the additional query overhead. We also show that reintroducing a concept is possible via fine-tuning even if filtering is perfect. Our results demonstrate that current filtering methods offer limited protection to closed-weight models and no protection to open-weight models, while reducing the generality of the model by hindering the generation of child-related concepts or changing their representation. We conclude by outlining challenges in conducting evaluations that establish robust evidence on the impact of AI safety mitigations for CSAM."}

We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values."}

However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models.

This one-step guarantee can be applied recursively at each time step, thereby yielding step-by-step safety assurances over extended horizons. Our approach formulates barrier certificate conditions based solely on sampled data and establishes PAC safety guarantees by leveraging the VC dimension, scenario approaches, Markov's inequality, and Hoeffding's inequality. Two sampling procedures are proposed, and three methods are proposed to derive PAC safety guarantees. The properties and comparative advantages of these three methods are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several numerical examples."}

Existing defenses, designed primarily for text-only LLMs, are unsuitable for countering these multimodal threats, as they are easily bypassed, modality-dependent, or generalize poorly. Inspired by activation steering researches, we hypothesize that a robust, general defense independent of modality can be achieved by steering the model's behavior in the representation space. Through extensive experiments, we discover that the instruction-following behavior of MLLMs is encoded in a subspace. Steering along directions within this subspace can enforce adherence to user instructions, forming the basis of a defense. However, we also found that a naive defense direction could be coupled with a utility-degrading direction, and excessive intervention strength harms model performance. To address this, we propose ARGUS, which searches for an optimal defense direction within the safety subspace that decouples from the utility degradation direction, further combining adaptive strength steering to achieve a better safety-utility trade-off. ARGUS also introduces lightweight injection detection stage to activate the defense on-demand, and a post-filtering stage to verify defense success. Experimental results show that ARGUS can achieve robust defense against multimodal IPI while maximally preserving the MLLM's utility."}

We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics."}

Nevertheless, most existing FAMA studies focus on downlink transmission under perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver side, while the uplink counterpart remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel codebook-based port selection and combining (CPSC) FAMA framework for the uplink communications without CSI at the base station (BS). In the proposed scheme, a predefined codebook is designed and broadcast by the BS. Each user equipment (UE) employs a fluid antenna, acquires its local CSI and independently chooses the most suitable codeword, activates the corresponding fluid antenna ports, and determines the combining weights to achieve a two-way match between the selected codeword and the instantaneous effective channel. The BS then separates the superimposed user signals through codebook-guided projection operations without requiring global CSI or multiuser joint optimization. To handle potential codeword collisions, three lightweight scheduling strategies are introduced, offering flexible trade-offs between signaling overhead and collision avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CPSC-FAMA approach achieves substantially higher rates than fixed-antenna systems while maintaining low complexity. Moreover, the results confirm that amortizing the optimization cost over the UEs effectively reduces the BS processing burden and enhances scalability, making the proposed scheme a strong candidate for future sixth-generation (6G) networks."}

While state of the art unlearning methods have emerged in response, they typically treat all points in the forget set equally. In this work, we challenge this approach by asking whether points that have a negligible impact on the model's learning need to be removed. Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient unlearning framework that reduces the size of datasets before unlearning leading to significant computational savings (up to approximately 50 percent) on real world empirical examples."}

The factorization converts the nested Bayesian dependency into a Markov-chain structure, allowing efficient computation. At the lower level, a Kalman filter with state augmentation performs such computation. Meanwhile, closed-form forward and reverse differentiation provide efficient gradients for the upper-level updates, and we compare the two models' space and time complexities to inform their practical selection. The upper level subsequently refines the noise covariances to guide the lower-level estimation.

This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\\pm0.05$.

The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%.

This paper proposes Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning (LA-RL) with Safety Guarantees, a novel framework that integrates the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into the actor-critic architecture with an improved safety layer. Within this framework, task-specific reward shaping harmonizes the dual objectives of maximizing driving efficiency and ensuring safety, guiding decision-making based on both environmental insights and clearly defined goals. To enhance safety, LA-RL incorporates a safety-critical planner that combines model predictive control (MPC) with discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs). This layer formally constrains the LLM-informed policy to a safe action set, employs a slack mechanism that enhances solution feasibility, prevents overly conservative behavior and allows for greater policy exploration without compromising safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptive, reliable, and robust solution for autonomous highway driving.

We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity.

Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise.

However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices' task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion."}

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one."}

To handle unmeasured PDE states and external disturbances, a state observer and a disturbance estimator are designed. Explicit bounds on the estimation errors are derived and used to construct a robust safe regulator that accounts for the uncertainties. The proposed control scheme guarantees that: 1) If the system output is initially within the safe region, it remains there; otherwise, it will be rescued to the safety within a prescribed time; 2) The output tracking error converges to zero exponentially; 3) The observer accurately estimates both the distributed states and external disturbances, with estimation errors converging to zero exponentially; 4) All signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded.

The results with different benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 achieves speedups ranging from 3.61x-6.46x over state-of-the-art tools, while reducing grid complexity by more than 23.3% without compromising accuracy. Compared to the commercial software COMSOL, 3D-ICE 4.0 effectively captures both lateral and vertical heat flows, validating its precision and robustness. These advances demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 is an efficient solution for thermal modeling in emerging heterogeneous 2.5D/3D integrated systems."}

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible."}

Current systems rely on linear or linearized models of glucose homeostasis, which may compromise prediction accuracy and, in turn, timely decision-making by the controller. Physiological variability further complicates insulin requirements, underscoring the need for controllers that adapt dynamically and reduce user burden. Methods: We introduce the University of Bern (UniBE) hAID system, a framework based on successive linearization model predictive control (MPC). The controller integrates basal insulin infusion with the insulin bolus delivery module for meal-related and corrective bolus dosing, adapting bounds in real time to glucose dynamics while accounting for both automated and user-initiated inputs. In-silico evaluation was conducted using the commercial version of the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova metabolic simulator across nine scenarios involving persistent and time-varying errors in meal timing, carbohydrate estimation, and basal insulin profiles. Results: In the baseline scenario, UniBE achieved a mean time in range of 92.0+-13.2%, with time below range at 0.1+-0.2% and time above range at 7.9+-13.2%.

The discrete-time dynamic evolution of each cognitive state is modeled using a first-order affine difference equation. Reliance is defined as a single discrete-valued state, whose evolution at each time step depends on the cognitive states satisfying certain threshold conditions. Using data collected from 16 participants, we estimate participant-specific model parameters based on their reliance on the automation and intermittently self-reported cognitive states during a continuous drive in a vehicle simulator. The model can be estimated using a single user's trajectory data (e.g. 8 minutes of driving), making it suitable for online parameter adaptation methods. Our results show that the model fits the observed trajectories well for several participants, with their reliance behavior primarily influenced by trust, perceived risk, or both. Importantly, the model is interpretable, such that the variations in model parameters across participants provide insights into differences in the time scales over which cognitive states evolve, and how these states are influenced by task complexity. Implications on the design of human-centric vehicle automation design are discussed."}

Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities.

To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions."}

As a result, a broad class of linear analysis and synthesis tools becomes directly applicable to powered spacecraft motion on SE2(3). A simple numerical example confirms that the error predicted by the linear Lie-algebra dynamics matches the error computed from the full nonlinear system, illustrating the exact log-linear behavior. This foundational property opens a path toward rigorous tools for satellite docking, autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations, robust controller design, and convex safety certification-capabilities that are difficult to achieve with classical local linearizations such as Tschauner-Hempel/Yamanaka-Ankersen (TH/YA)."}

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines."}

To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy. By minimizing stress and disturbance, this work improves both animal welfare and the reliability of physiological measurements, offering a refined alternative to traditional monitoring methods. This work represents the first demonstration of continuous radar-based vital sign monitoring in freely moving rodents within group-housed cages.

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models."}

These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search.

In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting.

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively.

Various complex factors lead to intricate low-altitude turbulence outcomes. Under current observational conditions, especially when using only wind profile radar data, traditional methods struggle to accurately predict turbulence states. Therefore, this paper introduces a NeuTucker decomposition model utilizing discretized data. Designed for continuous yet sparse three-dimensional wind field data, it constructs a low-rank Tucker decomposition model based on a Tucker neural network to capture the latent interactions within the three-dimensional wind field data. Therefore, two core ideas are proposed here: 1) Discretizing continuous input data to adapt to models like NeuTucF that require discrete data inputs. 2) Constructing a four-dimensional Tucker interaction tensor to represent all possible spatio-temporal interactions among different elevations and three-dimensional wind speeds. In estimating missing observations in real datasets, this discretized NeuTucF model demonstrates superior performance compared to various common regression models."}

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble."}

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape.

First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity."}

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $μ$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $μ$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget."}

Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification."}

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable."}

In contrast, Ordered SAEs impose an hierarchical structure that reliably identifies steerable features, but at the expense of more complex and less interpretable activation patterns. These findings advance the mechanistic interpretability of domain-specific protein language models and suggest that, while TopK SAEs are sufficient for mapping latent features to concepts, Ordered SAEs are preferable when precise generative steering is required."}

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation."}

Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them.

This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return).

This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings.

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet."}

By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression.

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions."}

Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business.

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality.

Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines.

In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences.

One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification.

We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping.
