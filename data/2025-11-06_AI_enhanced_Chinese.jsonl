Most existing anti-jamming methods\nrely on the assumption of accurate sensing and optimize parameters on a single\ntimescale. However, such methods overlook two practical issues: mismatched\nexecution latencies across heterogeneous actions and measurement errors caused\nby sensor imperfections. Especially for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based\nmethods, the inherent sensitivity of neural networks implies that even minor\nperturbations in the input can mislead the agent into choosing suboptimal\nactions, with potentially severe consequences. To ensure reliable wireless\ntransmission, we establish a multi-timescale decision model that incorporates\nstate uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose two robust schemes that sustain\nperformance under bounded sensing errors. First, a Projected Gradient\nDescent-assisted Double Deep Q-Network (PGD-DDQN) algorithm is designed, which\nderives worst-case perturbations under a norm-bounded error model and applies\nPGD during training for robust optimization. Second, a Nonlinear Q-Compression\nDDQN (NQC-DDQN) algorithm introduces a nonlinear compression mechanism that\nadaptively contracts Q-value ranges to eliminate action aliasing.

Conventional artifact removal methods\nrequire manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during\nfiltering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),\nhave shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack\nintegrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally\nintensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

By integrating\nreference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive\nwindows and generalizes effectively across subjects.

Milano"], "title": "Theoretical and Experimental Limitations of RoCoF Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "A precise estimation of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) is crucial\nfor secure power system operation. In fact, RoCoF is strictly related to the\namount of the available physical and/or virtual inertia of the system and the\nseverity of the active power unbalance following a disturbance. For this\nreason, it is widely exploited in different protection systems, e.g.,\nAnti-Islanding, Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and wide-area protection\nsystems. The new paradigm of modern power systems, with a low-inertia and\nconverter-based generation assets, is increasing the transient severity, making\nthe frequency and the RoCoF estimation more complex and less precise for the\nactual devices. This work addresses this issue by proposing a numerically\nrobust approach based on concepts inherited from differential geometry and\nfluid mechanics.

In particular, for Type 1 Diabetes\n(T1D), which is an autoimmune disease, relationships between demographics,\nsensor data, and context can be analyzed. However, outliers, noisy data, and\nsmall data volumes cannot provide a reliable analysis. Hence, the research\ndomain requires large volumes of high-quality data. Moreover, missing values\ncan lead to information loss. To address this limitation, this study improves\nthe data quality of DiaData, an integration of 15 separate datasets containing\nglucose values from 2510 subjects with T1D. Notably, we make the following\ncontributions: 1) Outliers are identified with the interquartile range (IQR)\napproach and treated by replacing them with missing values. 2) Small gaps\n($\\le$ 25 min) are imputed with linear interpolation and larger gaps ($\\ge$ 30\nand $<$ 120 min) with Stineman interpolation. Based on a visual comparison,\nStineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear\ninterpolation for larger gaps. 3) After data cleaning, the correlation between\nglucose and heart rate is analyzed, yielding a moderate relation between 15 and\n60 minutes before hypoglycemia ($\\le$ 70 mg/dL). 4) Finally, a benchmark for\nhypoglycemia classification is provided with a state-of-the-art ResNet model.\nThe model is trained with the Maindatabase and Subdatabase II of DiaData to\nclassify hypoglycemia onset up to 2 hours in advance.

However, caching all DNN models at edge servers with limited\ncapacity is difficult, and the impact of model loading time on QoE remains\nunderexplored. Hence, we introduce dynamic DNNs in edge scenarios,\ndisassembling a complete DNN model into interrelated submodels for more\nfine-grained and flexible model caching and request routing solutions. This\nraises the pressing issue of jointly deciding request routing and submodel\ncaching for dynamic DNNs to balance model inference precision and loading\nlatency for QoE optimization. In this paper, we study the joint dynamic model\ncaching and request routing problem in MEC networks, aiming to maximize user\nrequest inference precision under constraints of server resources, latency, and\nmodel loading time. To tackle this problem, we propose CoCaR, an offline\nalgorithm based on linear programming and random rounding that leverages\ndynamic DNNs to optimize caching and routing schemes, achieving near-optimal\nperformance.

Although machine learning models\nhave advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks\nthat compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.\nConventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require\nextensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits\nadaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and\nsanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot\nlearning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting,\nwhereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor\nanomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer\npoisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.\nThese strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable\nrobust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive\nevaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization\nquality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality\nand effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable\nIoT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0f\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff08IoT\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09 poisoned\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6-shot\u3001\u5355-shot\u4e0e\u5c11-shot\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u51c0\u5316\u3001\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51c0\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5c55\u793aLLMs\u5728\u63d0\u5347HAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "HAR\u5728IoT\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u533b\u7597\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7684IoT\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u914d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6/\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6c61\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u96f6-shot\u3001\u5355-shot\u4e0e\u5c11-shot\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u201d\u63d0\u793a\u8ba9LLM\u626e\u6f14\u4e13\u5bb6\u89d2\u8272\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u6c61\u67d3\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6e05\u6d17\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f7f\u9632\u5fa1\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6IoT HAR\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51c0\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7a7f\u6234\u5f0fIoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u51c0\u5316\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347HAR\u5728\u52a8\u6001IoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9LLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u5bf9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18/\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

To capture practical deployment\nconditions, the ship attitude variation is modeled through its roll, pitch, and\nyaw angles, each following a Gaussian distribution under low-to-moderate sea\nstates.

For instance, repeated\nuse may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may\nrestore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or\nGaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world\nsettings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics.

In contrast, wave particles\ncapture local wakes and ripples, yet are costly to maintain at scale and hard\nto match global spectral statistics.We present a real-time interactive hybrid\nocean: a global FFT background coupled with local wave-particle (WP) patch\nregions around interactive objects, jointly driven under a unified set of\nspectral parameters and dispersion. At patch boundaries, particles are injected\naccording to the same directional spectrum as the FFT, aligning the local\nfrequency-direction distribution with the background and matching energy\ndensity, without disturbing the far field.Our approach introduces two main\ninnovations: (1) Hybrid ocean representation. We couple a global FFT background\nwith local WP patches under a unified spectrum, achieving large-scale spectral\nconsistency while supporting localized wakes and ripples.(2) Frequency-bucketed\nimplementation. We design a particle sampling and GPU-parallel synthesis scheme\nbased on frequency buckets, which preserves spectral energy consistency and\nsustains real-time interactive performance.Together, these innovations enable a\nunified framework that delivers both large-scale spectral realism and\nfine-grained interactivity in real time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df7\u5408\u6d77\u6d0b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5728\u5168\u5c40FFT\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce2\u7c92\u5b50\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5149\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8272\u6563\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u6bb5\u6876\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "FFT\u6d77\u6d0b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u5047\u8bbe\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u518d\u73b0\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6d77\u57df\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u8239\u53ea\u3001\u6f02\u6d6e\u4f53\uff09; \u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6ce2\u7c92\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3e\u8ff9\u548c\u6ce2\u7eb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8c31\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5168\u5c40FFT\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce2\u7c92\u5b50\uff08WP\uff09\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8c31\u4e0b\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u8fb9\u754c\u6309\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u8c31\u6ce8\u5165\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u9891\u7387-\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u6bb5\u6876\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u548cGPU\u5e76\u884c\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8c31\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5c3e\u8ff9\u3001\u6d9f\u6f2a\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7edf\u4e00\uff1b\u8fb9\u754c\u5904\u7c92\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u6270\u52a8\u8fdc\u573a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u8c31\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u6df7\u5408\u6d77\u6d0b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40FFT\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8WP\u8865\u4e01\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u80fd\u5448\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8 wakes\uff1b2) \u9891\u6bb5\u6876\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u6bb5\u6876\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u4e0eGPU\u5e76\u884c\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002"}}

Traditional methods predominantly utilize\nelectroencephalography (EEG), which faces challenges such as high sensitivity\nto noise and the requirement for controlled environments. In this study, we\npropose the consciousness-ECG transformer that leverages electrocardiography\n(ECG) signals for non-invasive and reliable conscious state estimation. Our\napproach employs a transformer with decoupled query attention to effectively\ncapture heart rate variability features that distinguish between conscious and\nunconscious states. We implemented the conscious state estimation system with\nreal-time monitoring and validated our system on datasets involving sleep\nstaging and anesthesia level monitoring during surgeries. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models, achieving accuracies of\n0.877 on sleep staging and 0.880 on anesthesia level monitoring.

To systematically overcome this\nlimitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous\nelectrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from\narbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net\noperates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as\nlong-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and\nsuboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an\nenhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports\narbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG\ndevices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode\nplacement.

Experiments were\ncarried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under\nboth irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under\ninvestigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses\ndue to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven\nreduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring\nloads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of\nvessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware\ncharacterization of the model response by accounting for variability in\nhyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated\nthat both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular\nand irregular wave excitations.

In ancient times,\nphilosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure\nthe reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which\npertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic\nmachines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles\nand the real world still represents a challenge.

Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy,\nlexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the\nrelationship between oracle answer quality and question type.

We tested the safety and\nsecurity postures of eight open-weight large language models (LLMs) to identify\nvulnerabilities that may impact subsequent fine-tuning and deployment. Using\nautomated adversarial testing, we measured each model's resilience against\nsingle-turn and multi-turn prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Our findings\nreveal pervasive vulnerabilities across all tested models, with multi-turn\nattacks achieving success rates between 25.86\\% and 92.78\\% -- representing a\n$2\\times$ to $10\\times$ increase over single-turn baselines. These results\nunderscore a systemic inability of current open-weight models to maintain\nsafety guardrails across extended interactions. We assess that alignment\nstrategies and lab priorities significantly influence resilience:\ncapability-focused models such as Llama 3.3 and Qwen 3 demonstrate higher\nmulti-turn susceptibility, whereas safety-oriented designs such as Google Gemma\n3 exhibit more balanced performance.\n  The analysis concludes that open-weight models, while crucial for innovation,\npose tangible operational and ethical risks when deployed without layered\nsecurity controls.

Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,\nutilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.\nHowever, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue\ntrajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the\nconsiderable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these\nlimitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on\ndynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process\nas a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an\nenhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a\ncollaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees.

Specifically, echo signals from all reflective\nelements are received by each sensor and jointly processed to estimate the time\ndelay and angle parameters. Based on the above model, we derive the Fisher\nInformation Matrix (FIM) for cascaded delay, Angle of Arrival (AOA), and Angle\nof Departure (AOD) estimation in semi passive passive models, along with the\ncorresponding Cramer Rao Bound (CRB). To achieve precise estimation close to\nthe CRB, we design efficient algorithms for angle and location estimation. For\nangle estimation, reflective signals are categorized into three cases based on\ntheir rank, with different signal preprocessing.

This\npaper first establishes that the absence of key parameters, particularly\naircraft moments of inertia, makes conventional state-propagation filters\nfundamentally unsuitable for this application. This limitation necessitates a\ndecoupled, Equation-Error Method (EEM).

To overcome these dual challenges, we propose and\nvalidate the Constant-Gain Equation-Error Method (CG-EEM). This framework\nemploys a custom estimator with a constant, Kalman-like gain, which is\nperfectly suited to the stationary, low-signal-to-noise characteristics of\ncruise flight. The CG-EEM is extensively validated on a large, multi-fleet\ndataset of over 200 flights, where it produces highly consistent, physically\nplausible aerodynamic parameters and correctly identifies known performance\ndifferences between aircraft types.

Bowden", "Sergey Levine", "Jennifer Listgarten"], "title": "Leveraging Discrete Function Decomposability for Scientific Design", "comment": null, "summary": "In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design\ndiscrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity.

The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u56db\u9879\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u5728LLM\u4f4e\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5728\u6b27\u76df\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1AI\uff0c\u9700\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) Watermarking Categorisation\uff1a\u6309LLM\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5212\u5206\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5206\u5e03/\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u30022) Watermarking Evaluation\uff1a\u5c06\u6cd5\u6848\u7684\u56db\u9879\u6807\u51c6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u4ee5\u53caLLM\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u4e09\u500b\u89c4\u8303\u7ef4\u5ea6\u30023) Watermarking Comparison\uff1a\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u4eba\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u56db\u9879\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u56db\u9879\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684 Normative Dimensions\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u56db\u9879\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728LLM\u4f4e\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u628aEU\u8981\u6c42\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u5411\u672a\u6765\u5728LLM\u4f4e\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u3002"}}

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06 Transformer \u8868\u5f81\u89c6\u4e3a\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\uff0c\u5c42\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u539f\u7406\u3002\u82e5\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6cbf\u76f4\u7ebf\u524d\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5f2f\u66f2\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u5411\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u201c\u5f57\u661f\u6837\u201d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u540e\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3 Transformer \u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2/\u952e\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6210\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5e73\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u5c42\u5c42\u524d\u8fdb\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u4e0a\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u88ab\u770b\u4f5c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5851\u5f62\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u539f\u5219\u3002\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a (i) \u5bf9\u6574\u6bb5\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8f6c\u6298\u89d2\uff1b(ii) \u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u5c16\u9510/\u5e73\u5766\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u957f\u5ea6-\u5f26\u6bd4\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u7531\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6216\u968f\u673a\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b(iii) \u53d7\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65e5\u504f\u6298\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u68c0\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u66f2\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u53ef\u6d4b\uff1a\u66f2\u7387\u666f\u89c2\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u8bb0/\u5c42\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8f6c\u89d2\u968f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6-\u5f26\u6bd4\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6216\u968f\u673a\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u53d7\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u786e\u5b9e\u53d1\u751f\u53ef\u6d4b\u7684\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u671f\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5982\u679c\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6210\u7acb\uff0cToken \u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u5c06\u504f\u79bb\u76f4\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f1a\u56e0\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u4e0e\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u9a8c\u66f2\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, in air-ground (AG) scenarios, the high mobility of\naircraft induces intense and rapidly fluctuating turbulence, leading to\nadditional propagation loss that is often overlooked in existing studies. To\nbridge this gap, this paper presents an AI-empowered THz AG communication\nframework that explicitly models turbulence-induced attenuation through fluid\ndynamics and integrates it into an adaptive optimization paradigm for\ncommunication performance enhancement. Specifically, a fluid-dynamics-informed\nattenuation model is established to characterize aircraft-generated turbulence\nand quantify its impact on THz signal propagation. Building upon this model, a\njoint power-attitude optimization problem is formulated to adaptively allocate\ntransmit power and adjust aircraft attitude for maximizing link capacity. The\noptimization problem is efficiently solved using a diffusion-based algorithm\nthat learns the nonlinear relationship between flight configuration and\nturbulence-induced attenuation. Comprehensive numerical evaluations demonstrate\nthat the turbulence-induced attenuation ranges from 18 to 28 dB under attacking\nangles between -10 degree and 10 degree at 0.7 Mach, verifying the pronounced\nimpact of aircraft-induced turbulence on THz propagation. Furthermore, the\nproposed framework attains an average capacity of 11.241 bps/Hz, substantially\noutperforming existing strategies by 22.8% and 66.5%, and approaching\napproximately 98% of the theoretical capacity limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u6e4d\u6d41\u8870\u51cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8THz AG\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u98de\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u94fe\u8def\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\uff08THz\uff09\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u592a\u7a7a-\u7a7a\u4e2d-\u5730\u9762(SAGIN)\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a7a\u6c14/\u5730\u9762\u4e92\u8054\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6ce2\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u94fe\u8def\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u8870\u51cf\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u98de\u673a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5bf9THz\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u8026\u5408\u7684\u529f\u7387-\u59ff\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u98de\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u6e4d\u6d41\u8870\u51cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728-10\u00b0\u81f310\u00b0\u653b\u89d2\u30010.7\u9a6c\u8d6b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6e4d\u6d41\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a18\u201328 dB\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u5bb9\u91cf11.241 bps/Hz\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u7ea622.8%\u4e0e66.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u5bb9\u91cf\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7ea698%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6e4d\u6d41\u8870\u51cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7eb3\u5165THz AG\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u94fe\u8def\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e76\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, such systems are\nvulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where\nbots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning\nprocess and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust\nalgorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our\nknowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.\nThis estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no\ncost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out\noutliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.\nUpdating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence\nin experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence\nof corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing\nonly by an additive term tied to the total corruption.

In this paper, we propose a cooperative ISAC framework\nfor synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging by leveraging orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals. We address the challenge of\nsevere imaging degradation in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments under the\nQUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa). To detect weak signals\nand eliminate false points, we develop a two-stage compressed sensing-space\nalternating generalized expectation maximization (CS-SAGE) scheme for\nhigh-precision scatterer localization.

Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the\nnatural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing\nonly a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous\nlocations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring\nboth the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SparKer\uff1a\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7684 Neyman\u2013Pearson \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08AD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u66f4\u6613\u5931\u6548\u3002\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ed3\u6784\u6027 desiderata\uff08\u7a00\u758e\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u533a\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5212\u5206\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u7a00\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684AD\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u6784\u5efa SparKer\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763 Neyman\u2013Pearson \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5c40\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u5f02\u5e38\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u533a\u56f4\u7ed5\u7edf\u8ba1\u5931\u8861\u533a\u57df\u6765\u5212\u5206\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6838\u5373\u53ef\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u5343\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6838\u96c6\u5408\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u81ea\u7136\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "SparKer \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c40\u90e8\u6838\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u5f00\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

This paper introduces the concept of\nwireless-powered PAS, and investigates the reliability of wireless-powered PAS\nto explore the advantages of PA in improving the performance of\nwireless-powered communication (WPC) system. In addition, we derive the\nclosed-form expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for the\npractical lossy waveguide case and ideal lossless waveguide case, respectively,\nand analyze the optimal deployment of waveguides and user to provide valuable\ninsights for guiding their deployments. The results show that an increase in\nthe absorption coefficient and in the dimensions of the user area leads to\nhigher in-waveguide and free-space propagation losses, respectively, which in\nturn increase the outage probability and reduce the ergodic rate of the\nwireless-powered PAS. However, the performance of wireless-powered PAS is\nseverely affected by the absorption coefficient and the waveguide length, e.g.,\nunder conditions of high absorption coefficient and long waveguide, the outage\nprobability of wireless-powered PAS is even worse than that of traditional WPC\nsystem. While the ergodic rate of wireless-powered PAS is better than that of\ntraditional WPC system under conditions of high absorption coefficient and long\nwaveguide. Interestingly, the wireless-powered PAS has the optimal time\nallocation factor and optimal distance between power station (PS) and access\npoint (AP) to minimize the outage probability or maximize the ergodic rate.\nMoreover, the system performance of PS and AP separated at the optimal distance\nbetween PS and AP is superior to that of PS and AP integrated into a hybrid\naccess point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fd\u7684PINCHING\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PAS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282PA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5f3aLoS\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6709\u635f\u548c\u65e0\u635f\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684 outages \u4e0eergodic rate \u7ed9\u51fa\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u7528\u6237\u9762\u79ef\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u6700\u4f73\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5229\u7528PAS\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fdPAS\u5bf9WPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6ce2\u5bfc\u635f\u8017\u4e0e\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u5bf9 outage \u548c\u901f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u53d6\u6ce2\u5bfc\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65f6\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6709\u635f\u6ce2\u5bfc\u548c\u65e0\u635f\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e24\u79cd\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa outage probability \u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u4e0e ergodic rate \u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff1b\u5bf9\u6ce2\u5bfc\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef/\u63a5\u5165\u7aef\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfWPC\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65f6\u9699\u5206\u914d\u56e0\u5b50\u548cPS\u2013AP\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u79bb\u7684PS/AP\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u6df7\u5408AP\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u589e\u52a0\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7528\u6237\u533a\u57df\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5185\u5916\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u8017\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8 outage \u6982\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e ergodic rate\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u8f83\u957f\u6ce2\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fdPAS\u7684 outage \u751a\u81f3\u52a3\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfWPC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46 ergodic rate \u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfWPC\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f outage \u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6216 ergodic rate \u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u5206\u914d\u56e0\u5b50\u548cPS\u2013AP\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u5c06PS\u4e0eAP\u5206\u79bb\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u8ddd\u79bb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408AP\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fd\u7684PAS\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5438\u6536\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6ce2\u5bfc\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u5206\u914d\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff08\u5982PS\u4e0eAP\u5206\u79bb\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9outage\u4e0e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408AP\u3002"}}

A realistic, standard-compatible channel model is\nessential for ISAC system design. To characterize the impact of Sensing Targets\n(STs), 3GPP defines ISAC channel as a combination of target and background\nchannels, comprising multipath components related to STs and those originating\nsolely from the environment, respectively. Although the background channel does\nnot carry direct ST information, its accurate modeling is critical for\nevaluating sensing performance, especially in complex environments. Existing\ncommunication standards characterize propagation between separated transmitter\n(Tx) and receiver (Rx). However, modeling background channels in the ISAC\nmonostatic mode, where the Tx and Rx are co-located, remains a pressing\nchallenge. In this paper, we firstly conduct ISAC monostatic background channel\nmeasurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. Realistic channel parameters are\nextracted, revealing pronounced single-hop propagation and discrete multipath\ndistribution. Inspired by these properties, a novel stochastic model is\nproposed to characterizing the ISAC monostatic background channel as the\nsuperposition of sub-channels between the monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple\ncommunication Rx-like Reference Points (RPs). This model is compatible with\nstandardizations, and a 3GPP-extended implementation framework is introduced.\nFinally, a genetic algorithm-based method is proposed to extract the optimal\nnumber and placement of multi-RPs. The optimization approach and modeling\nframework are validated by comparing measured and simulated channel parameters.\nResults demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures monostatic\nbackground channel characteristics, addresses a critical gap in ISAC channel\nmodeling, and supports 6G standardization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411ISAC\u5355\u7ad9\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u76843GPP\u517c\u5bb9\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u7ad9Tx&Rx\u4e0e\u591aRP\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba4\u518528 GHz\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316RP\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e03\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "ISAC\u9700\u8981\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30 sensing \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728Tx\u4e0eRx\u5171\u5740\u7684\u5355\u5de5\u4f4d\uff08monostatic\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\u7684Tx-Rx\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u73af\u5883\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u4e14\u4e0e3GPP\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c28 GHz ISAC\u5355\u7ad9\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u73b0\u5b9e\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5355\u7ad9Tx&Rx\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08RPs\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6269\u5c55\u52303GPP\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u591aRP\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e03\u70b9\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u523b\u753b\u5355\u7ad9\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5355\u8df3\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5bb9\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u786e\u5b9aRP\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u586b\u8865ISAC\u5355\u7ad9\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8e6G\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aISAC\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In\nthis paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted\nassumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional\nindependence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap\nand derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our\nproposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of\ndifferent intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data\naugmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of\nthe same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples\ntogether. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we\ndevelop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive\nlearning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without\nrelying on additional modules.

However, current methods\noften overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on\nincreasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the\ndistance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner.

By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We\nfurther show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks such as hurdling.

Additionally, the\njoint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is\nunderexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the\ninteractions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution\nand marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel\ncopula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the\njoint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions\namong them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align\nthe marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a\nGaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint\ndistribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing\nmodalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our model over other competitors.

Despite growing emphasis on\ndata-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which\naccumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage.

To\naddress this, this paper introduces \\ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data\ncollection as a closed-loop control problem. \\ac{FCDC} continuously\napproximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online\nprobabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on\nfeedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance.

Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive\nlabeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to\nfailure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a\nnovel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome\nthese limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both\npoint measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.\nThis framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient\nfields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator\ndecoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies\npurely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds\nvia efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a\npriori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse\nproblems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based\nmeasurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO\nconsistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under\nsevere noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under\nvarying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to\nout-of-distribution targets.

Rather than relying on a single\n\"best\" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying\nstructures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich\nexplanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy\nstakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into\nthe objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,\nenumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging.

Through\ncontrolled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we\nreveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for\nlong-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in\nshort-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be\neffective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except\nin HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting\n(gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting\nlimitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes.\nThese results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical\ncontrol and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to\nlearned value functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRPO,\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60 critic \u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a critic \u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u9ad8\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\u901a\u5e38\u6709\u5229\u4e8e GRPO\uff0c\u4f46\u5728 HalfCheetah \u60c5\u51b5\u9664\u5916\uff1b\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u6279\u91cf\u5206\u7ec4\u53ef\u80fd\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5267\u672c\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00 critic-free \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u6298\u6263\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30GRPO\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08critic\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u79bb\u6563\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6d88\u878d\uff1a\u79fb\u9664/\u4fdd\u7559\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u6539\u53d8\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50 gamma\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u7ec4(group)\u5927\u5c0f\uff1b\u5e76\u5728 CartPole\u3001HalfCheetah \u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0 critic \u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u666e\u904d\u843d\u540e\u4e8e PPO\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u5982 CartPole \u8fd9\u7c7b\u77ed\u671f\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u624d\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u9ad8\u6298\u6263\uff08gamma=0.99\uff09\u603b\u4f53\u6709\u5229\uff0c\u9664\u4e86 HalfCheetah \u7531\u4e8e\u65e9\u505c\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u9700\u7528\u8f83\u4f4e\u6298\u6263\uff08gamma=0.9\uff09\uff1b\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7ec4\u5927\u5c0f\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f83\u5927\u7ec4\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6279\u91cf\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u6df7\u5408\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5267\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": " critic-free \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4ecd\u5177\u4ef7\u503c\uff1bGRPO \u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u3001\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0e\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

A recently emerging explanation is that learning\nalgorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,\nwhich have been consistently associated with improved generalization\nperformance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and\ngeneralization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with\na non-negative, $\\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in\nthis fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur\ntrivial $\\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.\nThen, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural\n''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),\ndesigned to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient\nDescent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which\nperforms gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we\nprove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,\nthe population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\\Omega(1)$,\nindicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware\ngradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient\napproximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although\nit minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also\nincur population risk $\\Omega(1)$.

We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific\nnotation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target\nimputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we\nuse a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit\nwithin a 128k-token window.\n  On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art\non classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically\nwith more context rows.

We introduce Behavior-Adaptive\nQ-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable\ntransition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit\nbehavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency\nsignal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that\n(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is\nhigh, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online\nexperience is accumulated.

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation.
