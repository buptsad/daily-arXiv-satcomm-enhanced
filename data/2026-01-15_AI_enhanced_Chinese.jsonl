Based on these conditions, we construct a family of $2$-D classical QC-LDPC codes with girth greater than $4$ by stacking $p \\times p \\times p$ tensors, where $p$ is an odd prime. Furthermore, for composite values of $p$, we propose two additional families of $2$-D classical LDPC codes obtained via similar tensor stacking. In this case, one family achieves girth greater than $4$, while the other attains girth greater than $6$. All the proposed $2$-D classical QC-LDPC codes exhibit an erasure correction capability of at least $p \\times p$. Based on the constructed classical $2$-D QC-LDPC codes, we derive two families of $2$-D entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. The first family of $2$-D EA-QLDPC codes is obtained from a pair of binary $2$-D classical LDPC codes and is designed such that the unassisted part of the Tanner graph of the resulting EA-QLDPC code is free of cycles of length four, while requiring only a single ebit to be shared across the quantum transceiver. The second family is constructed from a single $2$-D classical LDPC code whose Tanner graph is free from $4$-cycles.

Despite their central role in LLM pipelines, the link between tokenization, compression efficiency and induced structure is not well understood. We empirically demonstrate that tokenizer training scale redistributes entropy: as training data grows, the token stream becomes more diverse in aggregate (higher unigram entropy) yet markedly more predictable in-context (lower higher-order conditional entropies), indicating that tokenization absorbs substantial short-range regularity although these gains degrade under train-test domain mismatch. To ground these observations, we first benchmark i) pretrained GPT-family tokenizers as black-box compressors across various domains, and ii) learned tokenizers across configurations spanning vocabulary size, training scale, and domain. Next, we study tokenization as a transform for universal compression and introduce a compression-aware BPE variant. Finally, we adopt a channel lens and introduce capacity-utilization metrics to analyze tokenizer behaviour and outline implications for downstream modeling.

Obtaining the optimal QoS while minimizing resource consumption remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes the streamlined pathway (SP) model, which is a flow scheduling solution that requires minimal statistical knowledge of the DCN data plane. The SP model utilizes the software-defined networks (SDN) paradigm with less information gathered from the DCN data plane, besides the traditional hash-based flow scheduling mechanism, the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). In SDN, the proposed methodology harnesses a minimal yet powerful set of statistical data extracted from the DCN data plane, including port throughput and elephant flow information on the aggregate switches of the DCN fat-tree topology. Several experiments, in addition to theoretical analysis, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SP model in terms of QoS enhancement.

This scheme is built on 3GPP-supported sensing modes, and it does not incur any extra spectrum cost or inter-cell coordination. To reveal the fundamental performance limit of the proposed hybrid sensing mode, we derive closed-form Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing target localization and velocity estimation, as functions of target and UE positions. The results reveal that significant performance gains can be achieved over the purely mono- or bi-static sensing, especially when the BS-target-UE form a favorable geometry, which is close to a right triangle. The analytical results are validated by simulations using effective parameter estimation algorithm and weighted mean square error (MSE) fusion method. Based on the derived sensing bound, we further analyze the sensing coverage by varying the UE positions, which shows that sensing coverage first improves then degrades as the BS-UE separation increases. Furthermore, the sensing accuracy for a potential target with best UE selection is derived as a function of the UE density in the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u7ad9\u4e0eUE\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5355/\u53cc\u9759\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u9891\u8c31\u6216\u534f\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u517c\u987e\u5355\u3001\u53cc\u9759\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u989d\u5916\u9891\u8c31\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7ad9UE\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e3GPP\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5355/\u53cc\u9759\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u9891\u8c31\u6216\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u534f\u8c03\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u4e0eUE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u7684CRLB\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u52a0\u6743MSE\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8UE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73UE\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "CRLB\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5355\u9759\u6216\u53cc\u9759\uff1b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u968fBS-UE\u8ddd\u79bb\u5148\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6700\u4f73UE\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u968fUE\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u7ad9\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5355\u9759\u4e0e\u53cc\u9759\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53BS-\u76ee\u6807-UE\u6784\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f4\u89d2\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u65f6\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0fCram\u00e9r\u2011Rao\u4e0b\u754c\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a0\u6743MSE\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u9759\u6216\u53cc\u9759\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u539f\u7406\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cUE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3aISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Rather than encrypting entire point cloud frames, our approach encrypts only selected subsets of coordinates ($X, Y, Z$, or combinations), lowering computational overhead and latency while still producing strong visual distortion that prevents meaningful unauthorized viewing. Our experiments show that encrypting only the $X$ coordinates achieves effective obfuscation while reducing encryption and decryption times by up to 50% and 80%, respectively, compared to full-frame encryption.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a novel end-to-end evaluation of a DRM-enabled secure point cloud streaming system. We deployed a point cloud video streaming setup on the CloudLab testbed and evaluated three HTTP-based Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) granularities - ABE-XYZ (encrypting all $X,Y,Z$ coordinates), ABE-XY, and ABE-X against conventional HTTPS/TLS secure streaming as well as an HTTP-only baseline without any security. Our streaming evaluation demonstrates that ABE-based schemes reduce server-side CPU load by up to 80% and cache CPU load by up to 63%, comparable to HTTP-only, while maintaining similar cache hit rates. Moreover, ABE-XYZ and ABE-XY exhibit lower client-side rebuffering than HTTPS, and ABE-X achieves zero rebuffering comparable to HTTP-only.

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation.

However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, making hardware remedies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) impractical. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves an SNR improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction.

Compute payload - the unsustainable energy and capital costs of training and inference - threatens to outpace grid capacity and concentrate capability among a handful of organizations. Data chaos - the 80% of project effort consumed by preparation, conversion, and preprocessing - strangles development velocity and locks datasets to single model architectures. Current approaches treat these as separate problems, managing each with incremental optimization while increasing ecosystem complexity. This paper presents ServaStack: a universal data format (.serva) paired with a universal AI compute engine (Chimera). The .serva format achieves lossless compression by encoding information using laser holography principles, while Chimera converts compute operations into a representational space where computation occurs directly on .serva files without decompression. The result is automatic data preprocessing. The Chimera engine enables any existing model to operate on .serva data without retraining, preserving infrastructure investments while revamping efficiency. Internal benchmarks demonstrate 30-374x energy efficiency improvements (96-99% reduction), 4x-34x lossless storage compression, and 68x compute payload reduction without accuracy loss when compared to RNN, CNN, and MLP models on FashionMNIST and MNIST datasets.

We analyze the covariance deviation induced by channel variations to establish a theoretical bound based on channel correlation for determining the sensing window size.

Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle.

In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5TraceTarnish\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u5bbd\u5b57\u7b26\u9690\u5199\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e33%\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u63a9\u76d6\u4f5c\u8005\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u6297\u98ce\u683c\u5b66\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4ef7\u503c", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u98ce\u683c\u5b66\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u9690\u5199\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1", "method": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5TraceTarnish\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u96f6\u5bbd\u5b57\u7b26\u9690\u5199\u8986\u76d6\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5bf9\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u7eb9\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "TraceTarnish\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u73b0\u6709\u4f5c\u8005\u9274\u522b\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u96f6\u5bbd\u5b57\u7b26\u9690\u5199\u8fbe\u523033%\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u6a21\u7cca", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u98ce\u683c\u5b66\u4e0e\u9690\u5199\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u53d1\u7c7b\u4f3cTraceTarnish\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u5de5\u5177"}}

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach. We achieve millisecond-level processing and a throughput of approximately 30,000 queries per second on average, depending on system parameters.

These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.\n  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.\n  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional methods typically rely on simplifying assumptions, such as linear target motion, narrowband operation, or constant velocity, to enable fast computation. However, these assumptions break down in scenarios involving quadratic range-time behavior, high radial velocities or accelerations, or wideband signals, leading to undesired effects such as intra-pulse Doppler shift/stretch and target migration across Range-Doppler cells.

Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), existing LLM-based agents remain ineffective on high-difficulty cryptographic CTF challenges, which require precise cryptanalytic knowledge, stable long-horizon reasoning, and disciplined interaction with specialized toolchains. Through a systematic exploratory study, we show that insufficient knowledge granularity, rather than model reasoning capacity, is a primary factor limiting successful cryptographic exploitation: coarse or abstracted external knowledge often fails to support correct attack modeling and implementation. Motivated by this observation, we propose KryptoPilot, an open-world knowledge-augmented LLM agent for automated cryptographic exploitation. KryptoPilot integrates dynamic open-world knowledge acquisition via a Deep Research pipeline, a persistent workspace for structured knowledge reuse, and a governance subsystem that stabilizes reasoning through behavioral constraints and cost-aware model routing. This design enables precise knowledge alignment while maintaining efficient reasoning across heterogeneous subtasks. We evaluate KryptoPilot on two established CTF benchmarks and in six real-world CTF competitions. KryptoPilot achieves a complete solve rate on InterCode-CTF, solves between 56 and 60 percent of cryptographic challenges on the NYU-CTF benchmark, and successfully solves 26 out of 33 cryptographic challenges in live competitions, including multiple earliest-solved and uniquely-solved instances.

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES).

This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE.

First, we derive the optimal latent variance as the second moment under a Gaussian assumption, providing a principled alternative to hyperprior-based estimation. Second, we quantify the gap between uniform quantization and the Gaussian test channel derived from the reverse water-filling theorem. Third, we extend our framework to include context modeling, and demonstrate that accurate mean prediction yields substantial entropy reduction.

Specifically, IRSs are selectively deployed from candidate sites to shape the propagation geometry, while MAs are locally repositioned among discretized locations to exploit small-scale channel variations. The objective is to minimize the total deployment cost of MAs and IRSs by jointly optimizing the IRS site selection, MA positions, transmit precoding, and IRS phase shifts, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for all target areas. This leads to a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is intractable to solve directly. To address this, we first formulate an auxiliary problem to verify the feasibility. A penalty-based double-loop algorithm integrating alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to solve this feasibility issue, which is subsequently adapted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the original cost minimization problem. Finally, based on the obtained solution, we formulate an element refinement problem to further reduce the deployment cost, which is solved by a penalty-based SCA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs consistently outperform benchmarks relying on independent area planning or full IRS deployment in terms of cost-efficiency. Moreover, for cost minimization, MA architectures are preferable in large placement apertures, whereas fully populated FPA architectures excel in compact ones; for worst-case SNR maximization, MA architectures exhibit a lower cost threshold for feasibility, while FPA architectures can attain peak SNR at a lower total cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs.

Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images.

The first metric is called repair bandwidth, which measures the network resources required during the repair process. Another critical metric for repair efficiency is disk I/O cost, defined as the amount of data packets accessed at helper nodes to repair the failed node. In an encoding scheme with optimal I/O cost, the number of packets sent to the newcomer is exactly the same as the number of packets read from memory. This mode of repair is referred to as uncoded repair, as no coding operations are performed at the helper node. In addition to minimizing disk I/O cost, an uncoded repair mechanism has the advantage of incurring minimal computational overhead at the helper node. In this paper, we demonstrate that for single node failures, if all surviving nodes participate in the repair of the failed node, we can achieve all points on the fundamental tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth. The design of the proposed encoding scheme is based on the theory of gammoids, a specialized class of graph-based matroids. We prove that this scheme can tolerate an unlimited number of node repair iterations over a field of fixed size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u5931\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65e0\u7f16\u7801\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e2\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u78c1\u76d8I/O\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5b58\u6d3b\u8282\u70b9\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5b58\u50a8\u2014\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u6298\u8877\u70b9\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b57\u6bb5\u4e0a\u65e0\u9650\u6b21\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u78c1\u76d8I/O\u6210\u672c\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u5f80\u5f80\u4fa7\u91cd\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u7565\u78c1\u76d8I/O\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u800c\u65e0\u7f16\u7801\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4eI/O\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u627e\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u77e9\u9635\uff08gammoid\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u8282\u70b9\u4e0d\u6267\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5373\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u65e0\u7f16\u7801\u4fee\u590d\u201d\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5305\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u76f8\u7b49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u78c1\u76d8I/O\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0a\u53ef\u627f\u53d7\u65e0\u9650\u6b21\u8282\u70b9\u4fee\u590d\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u5931\u6548\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u4f55\u5b58\u50a8-\u5e26\u5bbd\u6743\u8861\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u6781\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u5931\u8d25\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u5b58\u6d3b\u8282\u70b9\u53c2\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6781\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6298\u8877\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A space-time reconfigurable intelligent surface (ST-RIS) impresses a continuous-phase modulation onto the radar echo, enabling uplink data transmission with a phase modulation of the transmitted radar-like waveform. The received signal is a multiplicative composition of the sensing waveform and the phase for communication. Both functionalities share the same physical signal and perceive each other as impairments.\n  The achievable communication rate is expressed as a function of a coupling parameter that links sensing accuracy to phase error accumulation. Under a fixed bandwidth constraint, the sensing and communication figures of merit define a convex Pareto frontier. The optimal bandwidth allocation satisfying a minimum sensing requirement is derived in closed form. The modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) for range estimation is derived in closed form; this parameter must be estimated to compensate for the frequency offset before data demodulation. Frame synchronization is formulated as a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and the detection probability is obtained through characteristic function inversion, accounting for residual frequency errors from imperfect range estimation. Numerical results validate the theoretical bounds and characterize the trade-off across the operating range.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Oversampling and pulse shaping are also discussed in the existing literature, but not in the context of channel estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of data-to-pilot and vice versa energy leakage caused by oversampling and pulse shaping in OTFS. Theoretical analysis is performed on an oversampled, pulse-shaped OTFS implementing the embedded pilot channel estimation technique, revealing a trade-off between the amount of energy leakage and excess bandwidth introduced by the pulse shape. Next, a novel variant of OTFS is introduced, called UW-OTFS, which is designed to overcome the leakage problem by placing the pilot in the oversampled time domain instead of the DD domain. The unique structure of UW-OTFS offers 36 percent higher spectral efficiency than the OTFS with embedded pilot. UW-OTFS also outperforms traditional OTFS in terms of bit error ratio and out-of-band emissions.", "AI": {"tldr": "1. \u91cd\u91c7\u6837+\u8109\u51b2\u5f62\u72b6\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u6cc4\u6f0f\u30022. \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u80fd\u91cf\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u6743\u8861\u30023. \u65b0\u7684UW-OTFS\u5728\u65f6\u57df\u63d2\u5165\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad836%\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u53d1\u5c04\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3OTFS\u4e2d\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u6210\u5f62\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5bfc\u9891\u80fd\u91cf\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6ce2\u5f62\u5f62\u72b6\u7684OTFS\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5bfc\u9891\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u57df\u653e\u7f6e\u5bfc\u9891\u7684UW-OTFS\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u80fd\u91cf\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e0e\u591a\u4f59\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1bUW-OTFS\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4e0e\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u53d1\u5c04\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfOTFS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86UW-OTFS\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff08+36%\uff09\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4e0e\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5e72\u6270\u3002"}}

However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \\textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5730\u9707\u7b49\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u65f6\u4e24\u8005\u5dee\u8ddd\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u4f1a\u5feb\u901f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u91cd\u8bad\uff1b\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982MAML\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684 SeisTask \u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u4e0d\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta\u2011learning\u5728\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u53ea\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\u57fa\u672c\u6301\u5e73\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE ICC 2026", "summary": "Cell-Free Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) have been active research topics in the wireless communication community in recent years. As an open-source software implementation of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5th Generation (5G) protocol stack, OpenAirInterface (OAI) has become a valuable tool for deploying and testing new ideas in wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present our OAI based real-time uplink Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) testbed developed at Fraunhofer HHI. As a part of our Cell-Free MIMO testbed development, we built a 2x2 MU-MIMO system using general purpose computers and commercially available software defined radios (SDRs). Using a modified OAI next-Generation Node-B (gNB) and two unmodified OAI user equipment (UE), we show that it is feasible to use Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) channel estimates to compute uplink combiners. Our results verify that this method can be used to separate and decode signals from two users transmitting in nonorthogonal time-frequency resources.

TEEs, such as Intel SGX, suffer from so-called rollback and cloning attacks (often referred to as forking attacks). Rollback attacks are enabled by the lack of freshness guarantees for sealed data; cloning attacks stem from the inability to determine if other instances of an enclave are running on the same platform. While rollback attacks have been extensively studied by the community, cloning attacks have been, unfortunately, less investigated. To address this gap, we extensively study and thoroughly analyze the susceptibility of 72 SGX-based proposals to cloning attacks.

Traditional rule-based and supervised intrusion detection techniques struggle to detect protocol-compliant and zero-day attacks under significant class imbalance and limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 IEC\u202f61850 GOOSE \u80fd\u5728\u6781\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u5931\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ee5\u202f99%\u202f+ \u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3001\u202f5%\u202f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "IEC\u202f61850 GOOSE \u534f\u8bae\u672c\u8eab\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5219/\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u534f\u8bae\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6781\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u5931\u8861\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\u8bed\u4e49\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f20\u8f93\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u91cd\u6784\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0b\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7\u202f99%\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u202f5%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u5931\u8861\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u653b\u51fb\u6837\u672c\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u73b0\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u4e0e\u96f6\u65e5 GOOSE \u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions.

This objective is motivated by several applications in information theory, where the index of coincidence naturally arises. A closed-form solution is known when the marginals satisfy a strong feasibility condition, but this condition is rarely met in practice. We first show that the measure of the set of marginals for which condition applies vanishes as the dimension grows.

Current commercial LLM providers deploy output guardrails to filter harmful outputs, yet these defenses are not impenetrable. Due to LLMs' reliance on autoregressive, token-by-token inference, their semantic representations lack robustness to spatially structured perturbations, such as redistributing tokens across different rows, columns, or diagonals. Exploiting the Transformer's spatial weakness, we propose SpatialJB to disrupt the model's output generation process, allowing harmful content to bypass guardrails without detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on leading LLMs get nearly 100% ASR, demonstrating the high effectiveness of SpatialJB. Even after adding advanced output guardrails, like the OpenAI Moderation API, SpatialJB consistently maintains a success rate exceeding 75%, outperforming current jailbreak techniques by a significant margin. The proposal of SpatialJB exposes a key weakness in current guardrails and emphasizes the importance of spatial semantics, offering new insights to advance LLM safety research. To prevent potential misuse, we also present baseline defense strategies against SpatialJB and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating such attacks.

This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased. These three approaches can be used together or separately, and they each have distinct advantages. The reconciled predictions can then be distilled into a single interpretable model for real-world deployment. In experiments across multiple datasets, our methods reduce disagreement metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among their variants, those that satisfy an additional combinatorial property called inclusiveness form a special class suitable for computationally efficient and highly error-tolerant group testing under the general inhibitor complex model, a broad framework that subsumes practical settings such as DNA screening. Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof is based on the probabilistic method and yields a simple and efficient randomized construction. Furthermore, we derandomize this construction to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time construction.

Detecting anomalies in these time-series measurements is challenging due to nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-scale temporal behavior across diverse building types and operating conditions. This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89.

SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRT \u5229\u7528\u6811\u7f13\u5b58\u91cd\u590d prompt \u7684\u7eed\u5199\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11 RL \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5ef6\uff0c\u6700\u5feb\u53ef\u63d0\u5347 2.08 \u500d\u7684\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\uff08Tree-Structured Cache\uff09\u5b58\u50a8\u76f8\u540c prompt \u7684\u5df2\u751f\u6210\u7eed\u5199\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u7f13\u5b58\u5e76\u5728 GPU \u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u524d\u751f\u6210", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6 RL \u6d41\u7a0b\uff08PPO\u3001GRPO\u3001DAPO\uff09\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6b65\u9aa4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9010 token \u63a8\u7406\u8d39\u7528\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cSRT \u5728 rollout \u671f\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8 2.08 \u500d\u7684\u5899\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\u52a0\u901f", "conclusion": "\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u6295\u673a\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5206\u5e03\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6"}}

These systems facilitate product recall and mitigate problems such as counterfeiting, tampering, and theft by tracking the manufacturing and distribution life-cycle of a product. Therefore, traceability systems are a defense mechanism against supply chain attacks and, consequently, have become a target for attackers to circumvent. For example, a counterfeiter may change the trace of a fake product for the trace of an authentic product, fooling the system into accepting a counterfeit product as legit and thereby giving a false sense of security.\n  This systematic analysis starts with the observation that security requirements in existing traceability solutions are often unstructured or incomplete, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed. We synthesized the properties of current state-of-the-art traceability solutions within a single security framework that allows us to analyze and compare their security claims.

Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time.

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9DASD-4B-Thinking\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9b\u793e\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8eSFT\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u2014\u2014\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfSFT\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u2460\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u2461\u6559\u5e08\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u2462\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u8feb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u8fbe\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7ba1\u9053\uff0cDASD-4B-Thinking\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700448K\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5176\u5b83\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "DASD-4B-Thinking\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684SOTA\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528448K\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u6bd4\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002"}}

The dominant framing of these threats as \"prompt injection\" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \\textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns.

However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Furthermore, when the Type I error is constrained to decay exponentially with a rate $c$, we show that the Type II error converges to 1 exponentially fast if $c$ exceeds the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D(P_1\\|P_0)$, and vanishes exponentially fast if $c$ is smaller.

While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem.

Interestingly, for the sub-Gaussian (S$\u03b1$S) vector, both estimators are identical generalizing the well-known Gaussian result of the conditional mean being the best linear minimum-mean square estimator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u5206\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1bS\u03b1S\u5411\u91cf\u4e0b\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u522b\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5b50\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u79f0\u03b1\u7a33\u5b9a(S\u03b1S)\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u671f\u671b\u548c\u5206\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6240\u7ed9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u5206\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728S\u03b1S\u5411\u91cf\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4e24\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5747\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u5206\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b50\u9ad8\u65afS\u03b1S\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\\% and 98\\%.

Our work is a significant generalization of a recent result of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025) that showed that the RPA decoder provably achieves vanishing error probabilities for \"low-rate\" RM codes, over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). While a straightforward generalization of the proof strategy in that paper will require additional, restrictive assumptions on the BMS channel, our technique, which employs an equivalence between the RPA projection operation and a part of the \"channel combining\" phase in polar codes, requires no such assumptions. Interestingly, such an equivalence allows for the use of a generic union bound on the error probability of the first-order RM code (the \"base case\" of the RPA decoder), under maximum-likelihood decoding, which holds for any BMS channel. We then exploit these observations in the proof strategy outlined in the work of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025), and argue that, much like in the case of the BSC, one can obtain vanishing error probabilities, in the large $n$ limit (where $n$ is the blocklength), for RM orders that scale roughly as $\\log \\log n$, for all BMS channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u9012\u5f52\u6295\u5f71\u805a\u5408\uff08RPA\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709 BMS \u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9636\u6570\u7ea6\u4e3a $\\log\\log n$ \u7684 Reed\u2013Muller \u7801\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790Recursive Projection-Aggregation (RPA) \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bf9\u79f0 (BMS) \u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5e7f\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u9053\uff08BSC\uff09\u4e0a\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u4f4e\u901f\u7387Reed\u2013Muller\uff08RM\uff09\u7801\u96f6\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528 RPA \u6295\u5f71\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6781\u5316\u7801\u7684\u201c\u901a\u9053\u5408\u5e76\u201d\u6b65\u9aa4\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9 BMS \u901a\u9053\u7684\u989d\u5916\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4e0a\u754c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u9636 RM \u7801\u5728\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u590d\u7528 Rameshwar \u4e0e Lalitha\uff082025\uff09\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5757\u957f\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\uff0c\u53ea\u8981 RM \u5e8f\u6570\u6309 $\\log\\log n$ \u91cf\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6240\u6709 BMS \u901a\u9053\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\u8d8b\u4e8e\u96f6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u4efb\u610f BMS \u901a\u9053\u4e0b\uff0cRPA \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5757\u957f $n$ \u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u4e14 RM \u5e8f\u6570\u7ea6\u4e3a $\\log\\log n$ \u7684\u7801\uff0c\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\u53ef\u8d8b\u8fd1\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9 RM \u7801\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u53d7 BMS \u4fe1\u9053\u9650\u5236\uff0cRPA \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ecd\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u5e8f\u6570\u7ea6\u4e3a $\\log \\log n$ \u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u53d6\u5f97\u96f6\u8bef\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4fe1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528 RM \u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics.

We present two significant advancements related to this conjecture. First, we resolve an open question posed by Courtade and Kumar, proving that for any Boolean function (regardless of bias), the sum of mutual information between the function's output and the individual noisy input coordinates is bounded by $1-H(\u03b1)$, where $\u03b1$ is the noise parameter of the Binary Symmetric Channel. This generalizes their previous result which was restricted to balanced Boolean functions. Second, we advance the study of the main conjecture in the high noise regime. We establish an optimal error bound of $O(\u03bb^2)$ for the asymptotic entropy expansion, where $\u03bb= (1-2\u03b1)^2$, improving upon the previous best-known bounds. This refined analysis leads to a sharp, linear Fourier concentration bound for highly informative functions and significantly extends the range of the noise parameter $\u03bb$ for which the conjecture is proven to hold.", "AI": {"tldr": "1) \u4efb\u610fBoolean\u51fd\u6570\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u603b\u548c\u22641\u2212H(\u03b1)\u30022) \u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8bef\u5deeO(\u03bb^2)\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u6027Fourier\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Boolean\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1Courtade\u2011Kumar\u731c\u60f3", "method": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u610fBoolean\u51fd\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3\\sum_i I(f(X);Y_i)\u22641\u2212H(\u03b1)\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5c55\u5f00\u7387\u5b9a\u754cO(\u03bb^2)\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7ebf\u6027Fourier\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c", "result": "\u2460 \u5bf9\u6240\u6709Boolean\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u4e0d\u53d7\u504f\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u754c1\u2212H(\u03b1)\uff1b\u2461 \u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u71b5\u5c55\u5f00\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f18O(\u03bb^2)\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u77e5\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ebf\u6027Fourier\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9879\u8fdb\u5c55\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Courtade\u2011Kumar\u5173\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u51fd\u6570\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u8303\u56f4"}}

We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets. Through simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the performance gain of EBC and EBC-H over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3001\u6bcf\u6b65\u53ea\u505a\u4e00\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684EBC\uff0c\u548c\u66f4\u7b80\u5316\u7684EBC-H\uff0c\u5747\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18Bandit Clustering\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u6c42\u89e3\u5b8c\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6781\u9ad8\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1EBC\u4e0eEBC-H\u4e24\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1aEBC\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u505a\u5355\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6/\u6295\u5f71\u66f4\u65b0\uff1bEBC-H\u4f7f\u7528\u5f85\u505c\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d\u5df2\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u51b3\u5b9a arm \u7684\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEBC\u548cEBC-H\u5728\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1bEBC\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u540c\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "EBC\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfBC\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u53ea\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u800cEBC-H\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.\n  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes.

A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBalDRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528min-sup\u7684\u5185\u5916\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u6563GroupDRO\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eedDonsker-Varadhan\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u6b65\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u8fc7\u4e45\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7min-sup\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5bfb\u627e\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u96be\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5728\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53d8\u4f53\uff1aBalDRO-G\u4f7f\u7528GroupDRO\u79bb\u6563\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u5b50\u96c6\uff1bBalDRO-DV\u91c7\u7528Donsker-Varadhan\u8fde\u7eed\u53cc\u91cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u548cMUSE\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cBalDRO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u3002", "conclusion": "BalDRO\u5728LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u5e73\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\u03c1\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\u03c1= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3).

Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data.

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "R4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0rMSE\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53cd\u9988\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5b9e\u9645RL\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "R4\u4f7f\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a\u5e8f\u6570\u76ee\u6807\u7684rMSE\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u96c6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u56de\u62a5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u6392\u5e8f\uff08soft ranks\uff09\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenAI Gym\u548cDeepMind Control Suite\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\uff0cR4\u4e00\u81f4\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u7ea7\u548c\u504f\u597dRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "R4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u7ea7\u6216\u504f\u597dRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002"}}

Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance.

To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs.

While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain.

Preprint", "summary": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics.

When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models. However, most CFL approaches rely on multiple communication rounds for cluster estimation and model updates, which limits their practicality under tight constraints on communication rounds. We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis.

However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment.

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop.

Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling.

In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens.

Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation.

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConGLUDe\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u86cb\u767d\u4e0e\u914d\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u9776\u70b9\u730e\u6355\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u4e0e\u914d\u4f53\u57fa\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u79bb\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u3002\n", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConGLUDe--\u5355\u4e00\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u5168\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4f4d\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u518d\u914d\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u914d\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u900f\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u628a\u914d\u4f53\u4e0e\u5168\u86cb\u767d\u53ca\u591a\u5019\u9009\u4f4d\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4f4d\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u9776\u70b9\u730e\u6355\u3002\n", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cConGLUDe\u5728\u65e0\u7ed1\u5b9a\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9776\u70b9\u730e\u6355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4f4d\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\n", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u914d\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cConGLUDe\u8fc8\u5411\u901a\u7528\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\n"}}
