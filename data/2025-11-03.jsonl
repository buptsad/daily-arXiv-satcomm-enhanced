Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our\ndataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness\nagainst adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack\nbenchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)\nmethod to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular\nmodels. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on\nattribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious\ncorrelations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes\n(color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in\nour dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's\nrealistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform\nevaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further\nexplore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of\ntraffic sign colors using color quantization techniques.

The integration of cell-free massive MIMO\nwithin the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture addresses the growing\nneed for decentralized, scalable, and high-capacity networks that can support\ndifferent use cases. Precoding is a crucial step in the operation of cell-free\nmassive MIMO, where O-RUs steer their beams towards the intended users while\nmitigating interference to other users. Current precoding schemes for cell-free\nmassive MIMO are either fully centralized or fully distributed.

In this paper, we propose a distributed and scalable\nprecoding framework for cell-free massive MIMO that uses limited information\nexchange among precoding agents to mitigate interference.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

However, data from different structures will follow\ndistinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for\nmodels learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,\ntransfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to\nalign the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered\n\\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do\nnot consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --\nupdating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA\nmappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this\nmodel is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to\nselect the most informative observations to label -- leading to further\nreductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The\neffectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental\nbridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several\ndamage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It\nis found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data\nefficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This\nresult has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of\nstructures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime\nof a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be\nachieved."}

To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a\ngraph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in\nformulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents\noptimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph\nisomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsuccessfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\\% consistent results\nacross random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming\nsolver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems.

We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call\npanprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction\ngeneralizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which\nrespectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or\nmany downstream tasks, but not both.

However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment.
