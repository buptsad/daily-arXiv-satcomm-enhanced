We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These attacks induce the model to generate erroneous or uncontrolled outputs through crafted inputs, threatening the generality and security of the model. Although existing defense methods have shown some effectiveness, they often struggle to strike a balance between model generality and security. Excessive defense may limit the normal use of the model, while insufficient defense may lead to security vulnerabilities. In response to this problem, we propose a Knowledge Graph Defense Framework (KG-DF). Specifically, because of its structured knowledge representation and semantic association capabilities, Knowledge Graph(KG) can be searched by associating input content with safe knowledge in the knowledge base, thus identifying potentially harmful intentions and providing safe reasoning paths. However, traditional KG methods encounter significant challenges in keyword extraction, particularly when confronted with diverse and evolving attack strategies. To address this issue, we introduce an extensible semantic parsing module, whose core task is to transform the input query into a set of structured and secure concept representations, thereby enhancing the relevance of the matching process. Experimental results show that our framework enhances defense performance against various jailbreak attack methods, while also improving the response quality of the LLM in general QA scenarios by incorporating domain-general knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6KG-DF\uff0c\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1 attack \u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u822c\u95ee\u7b54\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5411\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKG-DF\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u5b89\u5168\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9632\u5fa1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u95ee\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u4e00\u822c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u95ee\u7b54\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "KG-DF\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, this paradigm poses multiple challenges due to the heterogeneity of the devices at the edge of the network, their limited computational, communication, and energy capacities, as well as their different sensing and actuating capabilities. To address these issues, we propose an optimal scheduling approach to minimize the overall latency of a workflow application in an edge-hub-cloud cyber-physical system. We consider multiple edge devices cooperating with a hub device and a cloud server. All devices feature heterogeneous multicore processors and various sensing, actuating, or other specialized capabilities. We present a comprehensive formulation based on continuous-time mixed integer linear programming, encapsulating multiple constraints often overlooked by existing approaches. We conduct a comparative experimental evaluation between our method and a well-established and effective scheduling heuristic, which we enhanced to consider the constraints of the specific problem. The results reveal that our technique outperforms the heuristic, achieving an average latency improvement of 13.54% in a relevant real-world use case, under varied system configurations.

Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPQFL\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cPQFL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPQFL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u91cf\u5b50\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPQFL\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cPQFL\u5c06\u8bef\u62a5\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a23%\uff0c\u5728AUROC\u4e0a\u63d0\u534724.2%\uff0c\u5728AUPR\u4e0a\u63d0\u534720.5%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PQFL\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems. The result is a decision support tool that not only produces an optimal trajectory but also provides the necessary insights for its execution, thereby contributing to greater effectiveness and safety in the employment of autonomous ground systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARGUS \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u9762\u65e0\u4eba\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6218\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6307\u6325\u610f\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8461\u8404\u7259\u519b\u961f\u5b9e\u6218\u6f14\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6218\u573a\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5730\u5f62\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u548c\u6307\u6325\u610f\u56fe\u6574\u5408\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u9884\u89c1\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f5c\u6218\u6548\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eUGV\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u8461\u8404\u7259\u519b\u961f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6f14\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5747\u663e\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u4e0eUGV\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u6267\u884c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u5730\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ARGUS \u80fd\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6218\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Heemels", "Mauro Salazar"], "title": "Evolutionary Analysis of Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games with Discounted Payoffs", "comment": null, "summary": "We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7a33\u6001\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff08MSNE\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684 rest point \u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u591a\u805a\u7126\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7eb3\u5165\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4e2a\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7eb3\u5165\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u585e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u7c7b\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4/\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73a9\u5bb6\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u5728\u6709\u9650\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u53d7\u6240\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6536\u76ca\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u62e5\u5835\u7b49\u7fa4\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6df7\u5408\u7a33\u6001\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff08MSNE\uff09\uff1b\u5c06 MSNE \u4e0e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684 rest points \u5efa\u7acb\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa MSNE \u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u4eba\u53e3\u535a\u5f08\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e MSNE \u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684 rest points \u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0 MSNE \u7684\u6f14\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "MSNE \u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u535a\u5f08\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u8f6d\u9635\u5217\u96f7\u8fbe\u591a\u76ee\u6807 DoA \u4f30\u8ba1\u7684 Ziv\u2013Zakai \u4e0b\u754c\uff08ZZB\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u53ca\u591a\u5feb\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u6570\u3001\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b ZZB \u6bd4 CRB \u66f4\u7d27\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5411 CRB \u7684\u9608\u503c\u53d7\u53c2\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u5355\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\u5047\u8bbe\u7684 CRB \u5f80\u5f80\u5bf9 DoA \u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6781\u9650\u754c\u9650\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u63cf\u8ff0\u771f\u5b9e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u5e7f ZZB \u5230\u5171\u5b9a\u4f4d MIMO \u96f7\u8fbe\u7684 DoA \u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u901a\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5feb\u7167\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5171\u5b9a\u4f4d MIMO \u96f7\u8fbe DoA \u7684 ZZB\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u822c\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u5feb\u7167\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u3001SNR \u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u652f\u914d\u533a\u57df ZZB \u7684\u7d27\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u589e\u52a0\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u5982\u4f55\u538b\u7f29\u8f6c\u5411\u5230 CRB \u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u5bf9\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c SNR \u533a\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u7684 ZZB\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4f4e SNR \u533a\u57df\u6bd4 CRB \u66f4\u7d27\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u968f\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u9608\u503c SNR\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u65e9\u8fdb\u5165 CRB \u53d7\u9650\u7684\u533a\u95f4\uff1b\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u6539\u53d8\u8fb9\u754c\u7684 SNR \u884c\u4e3a\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e ZZB \u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u5feb\u7167\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u88ab\u6070\u5f53\u5730\u523b\u753b\u3002", "conclusion": "ZZB \u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5171\u5b9a\u4f4d MIMO \u96f7\u8fbe DoA \u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4 CRB \u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e SNR \u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed9\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u8fb9\u754c\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments.

Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\\%), and BERT (+7.8\\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism. These results highlight the need for advanced protective mechanisms for language models processing sensitive genomic data, while highlighting fine-tuning as a potential privacy-enhancing technique worth further exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a DNA \u5e8f\u5217\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e Pan \u7b49\u4eba\u5173\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5728\u672a\u660e\u786e\u5d4c\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7a7a\u767d\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5230 HS3D\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06 Pan \u7b49\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2) \u4e3a DNA \u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff1b3) \u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u78b1\u57fa\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\uff1aXLNet +19.8%\u3001GPT-2 +9.8%\u3001BERT +7.8%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u5904\u7406\u654f\u611f\u57fa\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function.

Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines.

The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects.

Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Movable XL-array-assisted covert communications in mixed near-/far-field scenarios improves sum-rate and relaxes covertness constraints; introduces an optimization framework with inner beamforming and outer subarray movement, solved by successive convex approximation and differential evolution; numerical results validate effectiveness.", "motivation": "Existing work largely assumes either near-field or far-field and fixed-position XL-arrays.

A Unifying Framework for Fairness, Robustness, and Distribution Shift", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $\u03b1$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \\approx (1+\u03b1)/(1-\u03b1)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains.

The second approach is a recently proposed one using a reinforcement learning paradigm called Q-learning. We do the comparison in terms of complexity and accuracy of the resulting controller. We show that the classic approach asymptotically efficient, giving virtually no room for improvement in terms of accuracy. We also propose a novel Q-learning-based method which we show asymptotically achieves the optimal controller design. We complement our proposed method with a numerically efficient algorithmic implementation aiming at making it competitive in terms of computations.

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme.

However, deploying these models in critical infrastructures presents a major challenge, as concerns about data privacy prevent unrestricted data sharing. Homomor- phic encryption (HE) offers a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data, but it remains incompatible with machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to their reliance on non-linear activation functions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes an optimized framework that replaces standard non-linear functions with homomorphically compatible approximations, ensuring secure computations while minimizing computational overhead. The proposed approach restructures the CNN architecture and introduces an efficient activation function approximation method to mitigate the performance trade-offs in- troduced by encryption. Experiments on CIFAR-10 achieve 94.4% accuracy with 2.42 s per single encrypted sample and 24,000 s per 10,000 encrypted samples, using a degree-4 polynomial and Softplus activation under CKKS, balancing accuracy and privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u884c\u7684CNN\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u7528\u540c\u6001\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f/\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u66ff\u4ee3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91cd\u8bbe\u8ba1CNN\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728CKKS\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5bf9CIFAR-10\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684 ML \u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5bc6\u6587\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46CNN \u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u5bc6\u6587\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u540c\u6001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u91cd\u6784 CNN \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728 CKKS \u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u5ea6\u4e3a4\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53ca Softplus \u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u52a0\u5bc6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CIFAR-10 \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 94.4% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bc6\u6587\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7ea6 2.42 \u79d2\uff1b10,000\u4e2a\u5bc6\u6587\u6837\u672c\u7ea6 24,000 \u79d2\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 CNN \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u6001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation. Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\u03b5^2)$ achieving at most $\u03b5$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length.

Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed. The results yield insight into the optimal line current and ACD profiles for different power modulation scenarios including the time of use electricity tariff and spot price.

The scope of this study focuses on enabling the management of insurance claims in a transparent, privacy-protecting manner while maintaining the efficiency and trust level needed by the patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. To accomplish this, the proposed system adds blockchain technology to provide an unchangeable, decentralized, and auditable claim transactions ledger which enhances overall claim-related processes and trust among all stakeholders. To protect critical patient information, the framework employs homomorphic encryption a modern form of cryptography to allow authorized insurance providers to perform necessary operations like claim adjudication and reimbursement on encrypted medical records without any decryption during the process. This method significantly reduces the third-party processing privacy risk because patient data can be kept secret even when third-party processing is done. In addition, smart contracts improve automation of the most important procedures in the claim processing pipeline, which decreases manual, operational, and susceptibility towards human blunders or deceitful acts. The integration of these two transformative technologiesblockchain and homomorphic encryption represents the core contribution of this work, enabling the coexistence of transparency and privacy which are usually viewed as competing objectives in traditional systems.

A Case Study", "comment": "2 Tables; ML/Big data paper on medical data", "summary": "The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable.

Bots and scrapers with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities can now detect and solve visual challenges, emulate human like typing patterns, and avoid most security tests, leading to high-volume threats like credential stuffing, account abuse, ad fraud, and automated scalping. This leaves a vital gap in identifying real human users versus advanced bots. We present a novel technique for distinguishing real human users based on hardware interaction signals to address this issue. In contrast to conventional approaches, our method leverages human interactions and a cryptographically attested User Presence (UP) flag from trusted hardware to verify genuine physical user engagement providing a secure and reliable way to distinguish authentic users from automated bots or scripted routines. The suggested approach was thoroughly assessed in terms of performance, usability, and security. The system demonstrated consistent throughput and zero request failures under prolonged concurrent user demand, indicating good operational reliability, efficient load handling, and the underlying architecture's robustness.

We propose a solution that parametrizes the Kalman filter exclusively using measured input and output data. The key idea is to use the innovations form which naturally accounts for the process disturbance and measurement noise into a single orthogonal stochastic process. Unlike process disturbances, the innovations process can be estimated directly from input-output data via a numerically efficient projection step.

Existing attack methods aim to prolong output by delaying the generation of termination symbols. However, as the output grows longer, controlling the termination symbols through input becomes difficult, making these methods less effective. Therefore, we propose LoopLLM, an energy-latency attack framework based on the observation that repetitive generation can trigger low-entropy decoding loops, reliably compelling LLMs to generate until their output limits. LoopLLM introduces (1) a repetition-inducing prompt optimization that exploits autoregressive vulnerabilities to induce repetitive generation, and (2) a token-aligned ensemble optimization that aggregates gradients to improve cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments on 12 open-source and 2 commercial LLMs show that LoopLLM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 90% of the maximum output length, compared to 20% for baselines, and improving transferability by around 40% to DeepSeek-V3 and Gemini 2.5 Flash.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoopLLM \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017/\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8f93\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u9650\u7684\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8fc5\u901f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ec8\u6b62\u7b26\u6765\u5ef6\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7aef\u63a7\u5236\u7ec8\u6b62\u7b26\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4f7f\u8be5\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "LoopLLM \u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a(1) \u91cd\u590d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6765\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u590d\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4f4e\u71b5\u89e3\u7801\u5faa\u73af\uff1b(2) token \u5bf9\u9f50\u7684 ensemble \u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c47\u805a\u4e0d\u540c\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728 12 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e 2 \u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cLoopLLM \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6 90% \u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ea6\u4e3a 20%\uff1b\u5728\u5bf9 DeepSeek-V3 \u4e0e Gemini 2.5 Flash \u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 40%\u3002", "conclusion": "LoopLLM \u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u53d1\u4f4e\u71b5\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u89e3\u7801\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u76f4\u81f3\u8f93\u51fa\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u91cf-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u8017\u76f8\u5173\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.\n  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8f\u6027MEA\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u8584\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faWRK\uff08Watermark Removal attacK\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6c34\u5370\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u6c34\u5370 benchmarks \u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u81f3\u5c1188.79%\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCFW\uff08Class-Feature Watermarks\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa.synthetic class\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u539f\u59cb\u57df\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u5176\u6c34\u5370\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316MEA\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u4e0e\u540eMEA\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u591a\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCFW\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297MEA+WRK\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u81f3\u5c1170.15%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301Protected\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u6743\u653b\u51fb\uff08MEA\uff09\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9MEA\u7684\u5b58\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8fMEA\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "1) WRK\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7531\u6c34\u5370\u4f2a\u5f71\u5851\u9020\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u89c4\u907f\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u30022) CFW\uff1a\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u57df\u5916\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u539f\u59cb\u57df\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u5176\u6c34\u5370\u53d8\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728ME A\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u4e0e\u540eME A\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "WRK\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u81f3\u5c11\u964d\u4f4e\u6c34\u5370\u6210\u529f\u738788.79%\uff1bCFW\u5728\u591a\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728ME A+WRK\u7684\u8054\u5408\u626d\u66f2\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6c34\u5370\u6210\u529f\u7387\u226570.15%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u7b56\u7565CFW\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c34\u5370\u5bf9\u6297MEA\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6c34\u5370\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u9762\u3002"}}

Positive definite barrier functions, when used in self-tuning super-twisting controllers may introduce some conservatism in relation to initial estimations of the perturbation rate bound. Moreover, discrete time implementation of the algorithm does not necessarily guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories when sudden changes in the perturbation occur in between two time samples. The salient features of the proposed methodology pertain to extending the use of positive semidefinite barrier functions to Super-Twisting controller adaptation and the employment of a \"nested barriers\" scheme that ensures boundedness of the solutions even for \"unfavourable\" perturbations-to-sampling time ratios. The stability of the closed-loop system is assessed via Lyapunov analysis and simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8d85\u626d\u66f2Sliding\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u901f\u7387\u754c\u9650\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957 barrier \u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u79bb\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5229\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u754c\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Lyapunov\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u4ee5\u5c55\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d85\u626d\u66f2\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d barrier \u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u7a81\u53d8\u53d1\u751f\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u53ef\u754c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55 barrier \u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957 barrier \u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d85\u626d\u66f2 Sliding \u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u5b9a barrier \u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u754c\u7684\u81ea\u6574\u5b9a\uff1b\u53d1\u5c55\u6b63\u534a\u5b9a barrier \u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5d4c\u5957 barrier \u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6270\u52a8-\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5229\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u5206\u6790\u7ed9\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa Lyapunov \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u901f\u7387\u754c\u9650\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u53d1\u6563\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u754c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5957 barrier \u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d85\u626d\u66f2\u63a7\u5236\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u901f\u7387\u754c\u9650\u548c\u4e0d\u5229\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u754c\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed.

In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, the proposed NPE method yields additional improvements in BER.", "AI": {"tldr": "WD-NOMA ISAC \u4f7f\u7528 AFDM/OTFS \u4e0a\u884c\u4e0e OFDM \u4e0b\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4 PD-NOMA OFDM \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cBER \u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14 NPE \u4e0e 2D-OMP \u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e sensing \u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728 6GISAC \u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\uff0cOFDM \u57fa\u6ce2\u4e0e\u4e0a\u884c\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u9009\u53d6\u5f15\u53d1\u529f\u7387\u57df\u4e0e\u6ce2\u5f62\u57df\u7684 NOMA \u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4e14 AFDM/OTFS \u7684 DFT-s-OFDM \u57fa\u7840\u4e3a WD-NOMA \u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u6ce2\u5f62\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa WD-NOMA ISAC \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e0a\u884c\u91c7\u7528 AFDM/OTFS\uff0c\u4e0b\u884c\u91c7\u7528 OFDM \u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u5c06 OFDM \u5728\u4eff\u5c04\u57df\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1 AFDM \u5e27\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u529f\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08NPE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6b63\u4ea4\u5339\u914d\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff082D-OMP\uff09\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65f6-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u6bd4\u8f83 WD-NOMA \u4e0e PD-NOMA \u5728 BER \u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528 AFDM/OTFS \u7684 WD-NOMA ISAC \u5728 BER \u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528 OFDM \u7684 PD-NOMA ISAC\uff1bNPE \u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347 BER\uff1b2D-OMP \u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u65f6-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "WD-NOMA\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e AFDM/OTFS\uff09\u7684 ISAC \u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4 PD-NOMA \u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e sensing \u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 AFDM \u4e0e OTFS \u95f4\u5747\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 NPE \u4e0e 2D-OMP \u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address this emerging need by introducing FedPoP, a novel FL framework that allows nonlinkable proof of participation while preserving client anonymity and privacy without requiring either extensive computations or a public ledger. FedPoP is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing secure aggregation protocols to ensure compatibility with real-world FL deployments. We provide a proof of concept implementation and an empirical evaluation under realistic client dropouts. In our prototype, FedPoP introduces 0.97 seconds of per-round overhead atop securely aggregated FL and enables a client to prove its participation/contribution to a model held by a third party in 0.0612 seconds.

To overcome this challenge, online and adaptive methods have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we consider the class of discrete-time linear systems with unknown time-varying parameters. We propose a simple, modular, and computationally tractable approach by combining two classical and well-known building blocks from estimation and control: the least mean square filter and the certainty-equivalent linear quadratic regulator. Despite both building blocks being simple and off-the-shelf, our analysis shows that they can be seamlessly combined to a powerful pipeline with stability guarantees. Namely, finite-gain $\\ell^2$-stability of the closed-loop interconnection of the unknown system, the parameter estimator, and the controller is proven, despite the presence of unknown disturbances and time-varying parametric uncertainties. Real-world applicability of the proposed algorithm is showcased by simulations carried out on a nonlinear planar quadrotor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u5dee\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u7b49\u6548\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u21132\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ebf/\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u65f6\u53d8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 LMS \u6ee4\u6ce2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u7b49\u6548 LQR \u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08CE-LQR\uff09\u7ec4\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u4e92\u8fde\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u589e\u76ca \u21132 \u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u80fd\u5bb9\u5fcd\u672a\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u53ca\u65f6\u53d8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728 \u21132 \u7684\u6709\u9650\u589e\u76ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e24\u5927\u7ecf\u5178\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5e26\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eMIMO OTFS\u7684\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684 pilot \u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u5d4c\u5165 pilot\u3001\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u9891\u4e0e\u591a\u666e\u52d2-\u65f6\u5ef6\u9632\u62a4\u5e26\u6765\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u865a\u62df\u9635\u5217\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684 OTFS \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f(CSI)\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u975e\u8986\u76d6\u5f0f DD \u57df pilot \u4e0e\u5b88\u62a4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u53e0 pilot\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684CSI\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u968f\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728 OTFS bursts \u7684\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165 pilot\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528TF\u548cDD\u9632\u62a4\u5e26\u4ee5\u5728 pilot \u533a\u7ef4\u62a4\u6ce2\u5f62\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u4e0e DD \u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u5148\u83b7\u5f97\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u865a\u62df\u9635\u5217(VA)\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u5c06\u7c97\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b57\u5178\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d(SSR)\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8f83\u5c11 pilot \u548c\u9632\u62a4\u5e26\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u77e9\u5f62\u8109\u51b2\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53ca\u5206\u6570\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u7684 pilot \u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u5e26\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u77e9\u5f62\u8109\u51b2\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u5339\u914d\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u6570\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5747\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u8003\u8651\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e TF-DD \u9632\u62a4\u5e26\u3001\u865a\u62df\u9635\u5217\u4e0e SSR \u7684\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd CSI \u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 MIMO OTFS \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In a concluding call to action, we encourage the technology community to openly share their PTMs so the security properties of each component are known up and down the supply chain.

This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance.

Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed.

However, the widespread use of encryption algorithms results in significant challenges for network defenders in identifying which specific algorithms are being employed. More importantly, we find that when the plaintext distribution of test data departs from the training data, the performance of classifiers often declines significantly. This issue exposes the feature extractor's hidden dependency on plaintext features. To reduce this dependency, we adopt a method that does not learn end-to-end from ciphertext bytes. Specifically, this method is based on a set of statistical tests to compute the randomness feature of the ciphertext, and then uses the frequency distribution pattern of this feature to construct the algorithms' respective fingerprints. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high discriminative performance (e.g., AUC > 0.98) in the Canterbury Corpus dataset, which contains a diverse set of data types. Furthermore, in our cross-domain evaluation, baseline models' performance degrades significantly when tested on data with a reduced proportion of structured plaintext. In sharp contrast, our method demonstrates high robustness: performance degradation is minimal when transferring between different structured domains, and even on the most challenging purely random dataset, it maintains a high level of ranking ability (AUC > 0.90).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e ciphertext \u968f\u673a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9\u52a0\u5bc6\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u660e\u6587\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u54ea\u4e9b\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u6587\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5404\u7b97\u6cd5\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5bc6\u6587\u5b57\u8282\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Canterbury Corpus \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC > 0.98\uff09\u3002\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u660e\u6587\u6bd4\u4f8b\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u7eaf\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u529b\uff08AUC > 0.90\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u5bc6\u6587\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u660e\u6587\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc6\u522b\u52a0\u5bc6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents.

The objective is to interconnect a grid simulation and a physical device via an interface in a way that is stable and accurate. Conventional approaches include the ideal transformer method (ITM) and its impedance-based variants, which trade accuracy for stability, as well as some $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control-based approaches, which do not make use of all the available information in their optimization for accuracy. Designing for transparency, as opposed to accuracy as existing approaches do, would achieve both accuracy and stability, while making use of all the dynamical information present in the idealized interconnection of the grid and device. The approach proposed in this paper employs model matching to formulate the PHIL problem as an $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control problem using transparency as the explicit frequency-domain control objective. The approach is experimentally validated in a real-time resistive-load PHIL setup, and is found to achieve accuracy levels that are comparable or superior to those of an ITM-based interface.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eH\u221e\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\u7684PHIL\u63a5\u53e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9891\u57df\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eITM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ITM\u53ca\u5176\u963b\u6297\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6298\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206H\u221e\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8fde\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7f51-\u5668\u4e92\u8fde\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06PHIL\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3aH\u221e\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\uff08model matching\uff09\u4ee5\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u9891\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7406\u60f3\u4e92\u8fde\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u963b\u6027\u8d1f\u8f7dPHIL\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u900f\u660e\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684H\u221e\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6PHIL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eITM\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684H\u221e\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u4e92\u8fde\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347PHIL\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods.

A Further Step Towards Understanding Jailbreaking VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks: researchers have developed a variety of attack strategies that can successfully bypass the safety mechanisms of VLMs. Among these approaches, jailbreak methods based on the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) strategy have garnered widespread attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper further advances the in-depth understanding of OOD-based VLM jailbreak methods. Experimental results demonstrate that jailbreak samples generated via mild OOD strategies exhibit superior performance in circumventing the safety constraints of VLMs--a phenomenon we define as ''weak-OOD''. To unravel the underlying causes of this phenomenon, this study takes SI-Attack, a typical OOD-based jailbreak method, as the research object. We attribute this phenomenon to a trade-off between two dominant factors: input intent perception and model refusal triggering. The inconsistency in how these two factors respond to OOD manipulations gives rise to this phenomenon.

The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems.

Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects.

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZeroSim \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u62d3\u6251\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u7ea613\u00d7\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e SPICE\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf SPICE \u4eff\u771f\u8017\u65f6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709 ML \u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u653e\u5927\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8fbe360\u4e07\u6761\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3001\u8986\u76d660+\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u7535\u8def\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u62d3\u6251\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eMLP\u3001GNN\u548c\u7eafTransformer\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4SPICE\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea613\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ZeroSim \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u653e\u5927\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While verification provides strong guarantees, current verification approaches struggle to scale to industrial-sized designs. Conversely, prevalent hardware fuzzing approaches are designed to find functional correctness bugs, but are blind to information leaks like Spectre.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and scalable approach: coverage-guided hardware-software contract fuzzing. Our methodology leverages a self-compositional framework to make information leakage directly observable as microarchitectural state divergence. The core of our contribution is a new, security-oriented coverage metric, Self-Composition Deviation (SCD), which guides the fuzzer to explore execution paths that violate the leakage contract. We implemented this approach and performed an extensive evaluation on two open-source RISC-V cores: the in-order Rocket Core and the complex out-of-order BOOM core. Our results demonstrate that coverage-guided strategies outperform unguided fuzzing and that increased microarchitectural coverage leads to a faster discovery of security vulnerabilities in the BOOM core.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8986\u76d6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6cc4\u9732\u5951\u7ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5 SCD \u6307\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5728 Rocket Core \u4e0e BOOM \u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u6cc4\u9732\u5951\u7ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u4e3b\u6d41\u786c\u4ef6\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u504f\u5411\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff08\u5982 Spectre\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7ec4\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u4ee5\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 Self-Composition Deviation (SCD) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u6cc4\u9732\u5951\u7ea6\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5728\u5f00\u6e90 RISC-V \u6838\u5fc3 Rocket Core\uff08\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\uff09\u4e0e BOOM\uff08\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e71\u5e8f\u6838\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728 BOOM \u6838\u4e0a\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5951\u7ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\uff0cSCD \u6307\u6807\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6cc4\u6f0f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Uncertainty estimation, often using predictive entropy estimation, is key to addressing this issue. However, existing methods often require multiple samples or extra computation to assess semantic entropy. This paper proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method that approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-$K$ probabilities. Moreover, we employ an adaptive mechanism to determine $K$ to enhance flexibility and filter out low-confidence probabilities. Experimental results on three free-form question-answering datasets across several LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms expensive state-of-the-art baselines, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing LLM trustworthiness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u524dK\u6982\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94K\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u5bb6LLM\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u4ecd\u7136\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u9876K\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9aK\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8de8\u591a\u79cdLLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u9700\u6c42\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u6c9f\u901a\uff08representation-supported communication\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u524d\u7f6e\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u98ce\u9669\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u8fa9\u62a4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u53ca\u5176\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3001\u6c9f\u901a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u8de8\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u70bc\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u6982\u5ff5\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u53d7\u4f17\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u900f\u660e\u7684\u524d\u7f6e\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u9700\u6c42\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ca\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u8868\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u6c9f\u901a\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5d4c\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6574\u5408\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6587\u732e\u5728\u900f\u660e\u524d\u7f6e\u98ce\u9669\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5145\u5206\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fa9\u62a4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bba\u8bc1\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}

Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets.

We present a versatile control architecture to regulate density and composition of a two-strain consortium without genetic engineering or drastic environmental changes. Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain. For both chambers we develop model-based and sim-to-real learning controllers.

SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts.

Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\\% and 19.6\\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684 conformal prediction \u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 HJ \u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u4e00\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5931\u6548\u96c6\u5408\u524d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5207\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d Hamilton-Jacobi \u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06 conformal prediction \u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 HJ \u503c\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u5b9a\u5728 unsafe nominal \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 HJ \u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u8be5\u5207\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 HJ \u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5355\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 CP \u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6297\u8bef\u5dee\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06 CP \u4e0e HJ \u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u96c6\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\u71b5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u540e\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u540e\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen2-VL-2B\u3001Qwen2-VL-7B\u3001Qwen2.5-VL-3B\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728RLVR\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u8d28\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7eaf\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\u6613\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u7b7e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u7ec4\u5185\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6392\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u6267\u884c\u71b5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5728GRPO\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u671f\u8f6c\u4e3a\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u5de9\u56fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5728GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cdQwen\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2-VL-2B\u3001Qwen2-VL-7B\u3001Qwen2.5-VL-3B\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u540e\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728RLVR\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9762\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5916\u90e8\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u53ca\u71b5\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration.

This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fd1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u51fd\u6570 g(\u03bb,t;\u03b2) \u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53c2\u6570 \u03b2 \u63a7\u5236\u5149\u8c31-\u65f6\u95f4\u5f39\u6027 \u03c1(\u03b2)\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u73b0\u6709 lazy \u4e0e feature-learning \u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u501f\u52a9\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u628a\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u653e\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u6838\u5f62\u5f0f g(\u03bbt)=\u03bbt \u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u6e10\u8fd1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5f62\u5f0f g(\u03bb,t;\u03b2)\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u8c31-\u65f6\u95f4\u5f39\u6027 \u03c1(\u03b2)\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4e0d\u540c \u03b2 \u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u9000\u5316\u56de\u5df2\u77e5\u7684 lazy\uff08\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e0e feature-learning\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53ca\u8bc1\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f g(\u03bb,t;\u03b2) \u548c \u03c1(\u03b2)\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u91cd\u73b0\u5df2\u6709\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b88\u6052/\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60TdRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u5355\u4e00\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5f80\u5f80\u540c\u65f6\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u5165/\u901a\u8fc7-\u5931\u8d25\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6307\u793a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u6765\u5206\u522b\u5b9a\u4e49\u6700\u4f18\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u82e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u56de\u62a5\u51fd\u6570\u4f7f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u96c6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5219\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8bcd\u5e8f\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff08lexicographic\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u56de\u62a5\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0TdRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728DeepMind Control Suite\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepMind Control Suite\u4e0a\uff0cTdRL\u4e0e\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\uff0c\u5929\u7136\u652f\u6301\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "TdRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3RL\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision.

This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods.

We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning.

However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u64a4\u56de\uff08continual unlearning\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6309\u5e8f\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u64a4\u56de\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u964d\u4f4e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u64a4\u56de\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6f02\u79fb\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u4e0e\u672a\u64a4\u56de\u76ee\u6807\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fde\u7eed\u64a4\u56de\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u6d1e\u89c1\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u64a4\u56de\u8bf7\u6c42\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u9010\u6b65\u5230\u6765\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\uff1b\u82e5\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9010\u6b21\u8bf7\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5df2\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9010\u6b65\u6d41\u5931\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u3001\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u64a4\u56de\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u64a4\u56de\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u7ec4\u9644\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u53c8\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u64a4\u56de\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u4e0e\u672a\u64a4\u56de\u76ee\u6807\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fde\u7eed\u64a4\u56de\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fde\u7eed\u64a4\u56de\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u64a4\u56de\u786e\u7acb\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u6d1e\u89c1\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction.

Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored.

IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (2024)", "summary": "The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u8be5\u56e0\u5b50\u7528\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u914d\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u4f18\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u6570\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u5404\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels).

Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5f88\u5c11\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u5173\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4ece MuJoCo Playground \u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7b49\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5168\u5c40\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7f55\u89c1\uff1b\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u6210\u7c07\u72b6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u53cd\u6620\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u6709\u636e\u53ef\u4f9d\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \\textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SafeMIL \u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u98ce\u9669\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u7ed9\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u504f\u597d demonstrations\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u907f\u514d\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6210\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u51fd\u6570\uff0cSafeMIL \u4ee5\u6b64\u6210\u672c\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u975e\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u82e5\u5e72\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeMIL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO.

Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "IGNS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f/\u7aef\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u7a0b\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7b49GNS\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNS\u5728\u6355\u6349\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6eda\u52a8\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f/\u7aef\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7aef\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6eda\u52a8\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5f3a\u8feb\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cIGNS\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684GNS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8GNS\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7aef\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6269\u5c55\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other.

We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods.

However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue.

A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor.

The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy.

Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances.

To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \\textit{global stability}, \\textit{phase sensitivity}, and \\textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\\% in MSE and 5.15\\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting.

The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations.

Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution.

Despite its importance, prior approaches largely rely on empirical heuristics and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \\emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.\n  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \\emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \\emph{direct} and \\emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.\n  Furthermore, we establish a general \\emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure.

Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop.

We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.\n  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u4e14\u6cbf\u975e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4e09\u95e8\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51faRLVR\u4e0eSFT\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e3a\u4f55\u662f\u8868\u9762\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThree-Gate Theory\uff1aGate I KL Anchor \u9650\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u3001Gate II Model Geometry \u5c06\u6b65\u957f\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f3\u4f4e\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u8c31\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001Gate III Precision \u5c06\u5fae\u66f4\u65b0\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u975e\u9996\u9009\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0eSFT/LoRA\u7b49PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u66f4\u65b0\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u4e14\u8de8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bOff-principal\u66f4\u65b0\u5e26\u6765\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u8c31\u6f02\u79fb\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d7\u63a7\uff1b\u4e0eSFT\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRLVR\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14SFT\u6613\u626d\u66f2\u8c31\u4e0e\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u8d70\u7684\u662f\u4e0eSFT\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8eRLVR\u7684\u539f\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u8fc1\u79fbSFT\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the \"domain grid\") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings.
