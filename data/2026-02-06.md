Abstract: In this work, we study multi-sensor scheduling for remote state estimation over wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels using a novel semantic over-the-air (SemOTA) aggregation approach. We first revisit Kalman filtering with conventional over-the-air (OTA) aggregation and highlight its transmit power limitations. To balance power efficiency and estimation performance, we formulate the scheduling task as a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) problem. By analyzing the structure of the optimal Q-function, we show that the resulting scheduling policy exhibits a semantic structure that adapts online to the estimation error covariance and channel variations. To obtain a practical solution, we derive a tractable upper bound on the Q-function via a positive semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition, which enables an efficient approximate scheduling policy and a low-complexity remote estimation algorithm. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in both estimation accuracy and power efficiency.

Abstract: Nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are powerful tools for modeling real-world dynamical systems. However, propagating initial state uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics, especially when the ODE is unknown and learned from data, remains a major challenge. This paper introduces a novel continuum dynamics perspective for model learning that enables formal uncertainty propagation by constructing Taylor series approximations of probabilistic events. We establish sufficient conditions for the soundness of the approach and prove its asymptotic convergence. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, particularly when predicting rare events.

Abstract: While the rapid expansion of data centers poses challenges for power grids, it also offers new opportunities as potentially flexible loads. Existing power system research often abstracts data centers as aggregate resources, while computer system research primarily focuses on optimizing GPU energy efficiency and largely ignores the grid impacts of optimized GPU power consumption. To bridge this gap, we develop a GPU-to-Grid framework that couples device-level GPU control with power system objectives. We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems. Our key insight is that reducing GPU power consumption alleviates violations of lower voltage limits, while increasing GPU power mitigates violations near upper voltage limits in distribution systems; this runs counter to the common belief that minimizing GPU power consumption is always beneficial to power grids.

Abstract: Neural network controllers are increasingly deployed in robotic systems for tasks such as trajectory tracking and pose stabilization. However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.

Abstract: Control of nonlinear systems with high levels of uncertainty is practically relevant and theoretically challenging. This paper presents a numerical investigation of an adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique that relies entirely on online system identification without prior modeling, training, or data collection. In particular, the paper considers predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC), which is an extension of generalized predictive control. Nonlinear PCAC (NPCAC) uses recursive least squares (RLS) with subspace of information forgetting (SIFt) to identify a discrete-time, pseudo-linear, input-output model, which is used with iterative MPC for nonlinear receding-horizon optimization. The performance of NPCAC is illustrated using polynomial, Fourier, and cubic-spline basis functions.

Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) have gained significant attention for their scalability and wide coverage in next-generation communication systems. A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the "price of autonomy," where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators' policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows. These findings validate the proposed framework's ability to deliver practical benefits of orchestrated multi-operator collaboration in future NTN environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Monitoring drift into failure is hindered by Euclidean anomaly detection that can conflate safe operational trade-offs with risk accumulation in signals expressed as shares, and by architectural churn that makes fixed schemas (and learned models) stale before rare boundary events occur. Rasmussen's dynamic safety model motivates drift under competing pressures, but operationalizing it for software is difficult because many high-value operational signals (effort, remaining margin, incident impact) are compositional and their parts evolve. We propose a vision for drift observability on the simplex: model drift and boundary proximity in Aitchison geometry to obtain coordinate-invariant direction and distance-to-safety in interpretable balance coordinates. To remain comparable under churn, a monitor would continuously refresh its part inventory and policy-defined boundaries from engineering artifacts and apply lineage-aware aggregation. We outline early-warning diagnostics and falsifiable hypotheses for future evaluation.

Abstract: We present an injustice-aware innovation-diffusion model extending the Generalized Linear Threshold framework by assigning agents activation thresholds drawn from a Beta distribution to capture the stochastic nature of adoption shaped by inequalities. Because incentive policies themselves can inadvertently amplify these inequalities, building on this model, we design a fair Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that incorporates equality and equity objectives for allocating incentives. Simulations using real mobility-habit data show that injustice reduces overall adoption, while equality smooths incentive distribution and equity reduces disparities in the final outcomes. Thus, incorporating fairness ensures effective diffusion without exacerbating existing social inequalities.

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized controller for large-scale heterogeneous multi-agent systems subject to bounded external disturbances, where agents must satisfy Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications requiring cooperation among non-communicating agents. To address the lack of direct communication, we employ a decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance State Observer (k-hop PPSO) to provide each agent with state estimates of those agents it cannot communicate with. By leveraging the performance bounds on the state estimation errors guaranteed by the k-hop PPSO, we first modify the space robustness of the STL tasks to account for these errors, and then exploit the modified robustness to design a decentralized continuous-time feedback controller that ensures satisfaction of the STL tasks even under worst-case estimation errors. A simulation result is provided to validate the proposed framework.

Abstract: This paper proposes an Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network (Noisy DQN) to enhance the exploration and stability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when applying deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments. This method enhances the exploration ability by combining the residual NoisyLinear layer with an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism, while improving training stability through smooth loss and soft target network updates. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves faster convergence and up to $+40$ higher rewards compared to standard DQN and quickly reach to the minimum number of steps required for the task 28 in the 15 * 15 grid navigation environment set up. The results show that our comprehensive improvements to the network structure of NoisyNet, exploration control, and training stability contribute to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of deep Q-learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In multi-agent systems, dynamic average consensus (DAC) is a decentralized estimation strategy in which a set of agents tracks the average of time-varying reference signals. Because DAC requires exchanging state information with neighbors, attackers may gain access to these states and infer private information. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving method that protects each agent's reference signal from external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious agents while achieving the same convergence accuracy and convergence rate as conventional DAC. Our approach masks the reference signals by having each agent draw a random real number for each neighbor, exchanges that number over an encrypted channel at the initialization, and computes a masking value to form a masked reference. Then the agents run the conventional DAC algorithm using the masked references. Convergence and privacy analyses show that the proposed algorithm matches the convergence properties of conventional DAC while preserving the privacy of the reference signals. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving DAC algorithm.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Safety filtering is an effective method for enforcing constraints in safety-critical systems, but existing methods typically assume perfect state information. This limitation is especially problematic for systems that rely on neural network (NN)-based state estimators, which can be highly sensitive to noise and adversarial input perturbations. We address these problems by introducing GUARDIAN: Guaranteed Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Defense against Adversarial INterference, a safety filtering framework that provides formal safety guarantees for systems with NN-based state estimators. At runtime, GUARDIAN uses neural network verification tools to provide guaranteed bounds on the system's state estimate given possible perturbations to its observation. It then uses a modified Hamilton-Jacobi reachability formulation to construct a safety filter that adjusts the nominal control input based on the verified state bounds and safety constraints. The result is an uncertainty-aware filter that ensures safety despite the system's reliance on an NN estimator with noisy, possibly adversarial, input observations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that GUARDIAN effectively defends systems against adversarial attacks that would otherwise lead to a violation of safety constraints.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely adopted for their strong generative capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks typically rely on fixed textual triggers and single-entity backdoor targets, making them highly susceptible to enumeration-based input defenses and attention-consistency detection. In this work, we propose Semantic-level Backdoor Attack (SemBD), which implants backdoors at the representation level by defining triggers as continuous semantic regions rather than discrete textual patterns. Concretely, SemBD injects semantic backdoors by distillation-based editing of the key and value projection matrices in cross-attention layers, enabling diverse prompts with identical semantic compositions to reliably activate the backdoor attack. To further enhance stealthiness, SemBD incorporates a semantic regularization to prevent unintended activation under incomplete semantics, as well as multi-entity backdoor targets that avoid highly consistent cross-attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemBD achieves a 100% attack success rate while maintaining strong robustness against state-of-the-art input-level defenses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a data poisoning attack -- Phantom Transfer -- with the property that, even if you know precisely how the poison was placed into an otherwise benign dataset, you cannot filter it out. We achieve this by modifying subliminal learning to work in real-world contexts and demonstrate that the attack works across models, including GPT-4.1. Indeed, even fully paraphrasing every sample in the dataset using a different model does not stop the attack. We also discuss connections to steering vectors and show that one can plant password-triggered behaviours into models while still beating defences.
  This suggests that data-level defences are insufficient for stopping sophisticated data poisoning attacks. We suggest that future work should focus on model audits and white-box security methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems introduce complex privacy risks throughout their lifecycle, especially when processing sensitive or high-dimensional data. Beyond the seven traditional privacy threat categories defined by the LINDDUN framework, AI systems are also exposed to model-centric privacy attacks such as membership inference and model inversion, which LINDDUN does not cover. To address both classical LINDDUN threats and additional AI-driven privacy attacks, PriMod4AI introduces a hybrid privacy threat modeling approach that unifies two structured knowledge sources, a LINDDUN knowledge base representing the established taxonomy, and a model-centric privacy attack knowledge base capturing threats outside LINDDUN. These knowledge bases are embedded into a vector database for semantic retrieval and combined with system level metadata derived from Data Flow Diagram. PriMod4AI uses retrieval-augmented and Data Flow specific prompt generation to guide large language models (LLMs) in identifying, explaining, and categorizing privacy threats across lifecycle stages. The framework produces justified and taxonomy-grounded threat assessments that integrate both classical and AI-driven perspectives. Evaluation on two AI systems indicates that PriMod4AI provides broad coverage of classical privacy categories while additionally identifying model-centric privacy threats. The framework produces consistent, knowledge-grounded outputs across LLMs, as reflected in agreement scores in the observed range.

Abstract: Future AI deployments will likely be monitored for malicious behaviour. The ability of these AIs to subvert monitors by adversarially selecting against them - attack selection - is particularly concerning. To study this, we let a red team create attack policies that attempt to insert attacks into code without being caught by a monitor in the concentrated BigCodeBench backdooring setting. We decompose attack selection into two problems: mapping attacks to a quality score and mapping quality scores to submission probabilities. We frame attack selection as a classification problem and show that safety is significantly more sensitive to FPR than TPR. We find that prompting the attacker model to reason about the monitor while being cautious with attack selection reduces safety from a baseline of 99% to 59% at 0.5% auditing budget, emphasizing that eliciting attack selection capabilities of models is vital to avoid overly optimistic safety scores in control evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI systems has collapsed the credibility landscape for photographic evidence. Modern image generation models produce photorealistic images undermining the evidentiary foundation upon which journalism and public discourse depend. Existing authentication approaches, such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), embed cryptographically signed metadata directly into image files but suffer from two critical failures: technical vulnerability to metadata stripping during social media reprocessing, and structural dependency on corporate-controlled verification infrastructure where commercial incentives may conflict with public interest. We present the Birthmark Standard, an authentication architecture leveraging manufacturing-unique sensor entropy from non-uniformity correction (NUC) maps and PRNU patterns to generate hardware-rooted authentication keys. During capture, cameras create anonymized authentication certificates proving sensor authenticity without exposing device identity via a key table architecture maintaining anonymity sets exceeding 1,000 devices. Authentication records are stored on a consortium blockchain operated by journalism organizations rather than commercial platforms, enabling verification that survives all metadata loss. We formally verify privacy properties using ProVerif, proving observational equivalence for Manufacturer Non-Correlation and Blockchain Observer Non-Identification under Dolev-Yao adversary assumptions. The architecture is validated through prototype implementation using Raspberry Pi 4 hardware, demonstrating the complete cryptographic pipeline. Performance analysis projects camera overhead below 100ms and verification latency below 500ms at scale of one million daily authentications.

Abstract: The landscape of synthetic media has been irrevocably altered by text-to-video (T2V) models, whose outputs are rapidly approaching indistinguishability from reality. Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review].

Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in image geolocation, a capability further sharpened by frontier multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs). This poses a significant privacy risk, as these widely accessible models can be exploited to infer sensitive locations from casually shared photos, often at street-level precision, potentially surpassing the level of detail the sharer consented or intended to disclose. While recent work has proposed applying a blanket restriction on geolocation disclosure to combat this risk, these measures fail to distinguish valid geolocation uses from malicious behavior. Instead, VLMs should maintain contextual integrity by reasoning about elements within an image to determine the appropriate level of information disclosure, balancing privacy and utility. To evaluate how well models respect contextual integrity, we introduce VLM-GEOPRIVACY, a benchmark that challenges VLMs to interpret latent social norms and contextual cues in real-world images and determine the appropriate level of location disclosure. Our evaluation of 14 leading VLMs shows that, despite their ability to precisely geolocate images, the models are poorly aligned with human privacy expectations. They often over-disclose in sensitive contexts and are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks. Our results call for new design principles in multimodal systems to incorporate context-conditioned privacy reasoning.

Abstract: Online scams across email, short message services, and social media increasingly challenge everyday risk assessment, particularly as generative AI enables more fluent and context-aware deception. Although transformer-based detectors achieve strong predictive performance, their explanations are often opaque to non-experts or misaligned with model decisions. We propose VEXA, an evidence-grounded and persona-adaptive framework for generating learner-facing scam explanations by integrating GradientSHAP-based attribution with theory-informed vulnerability personas. Evaluation across multi-channel datasets shows that grounding explanations in detector-derived evidence improves semantic reliability without increasing linguistic complexity, while persona conditioning introduces interpretable stylistic variation without disrupting evidential alignment. These results reveal a key design insight: evidential grounding governs semantic correctness, whereas persona-based adaptation operates at the level of presentation under constraints of faithfulness. Together, VEXA demonstrates the feasibility of persona-adaptive, evidence-grounded explanations and provides design guidance for trustworthy, learner-facing security explanations in non-formal contexts.

Abstract: As AI agents automate critical workloads, they remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Current defenses rely on monitoring protocols that jointly evaluate an agent's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool-use actions to ensure alignment with user intent. We demonstrate that these monitoring-based defenses can be bypassed via a novel Agent-as-a-Proxy attack, where prompt injection attacks treat the agent as a delivery mechanism, bypassing both agent and monitor simultaneously. While prior work on scalable oversight has focused on whether small monitors can supervise large agents, we show that even frontier-scale monitors are vulnerable. Large-scale monitoring models like Qwen2.5-72B can be bypassed by agents with similar capabilities, such as GPT-4o mini and Llama-3.1-70B. On the AgentDojo benchmark, we achieve a high attack success rate against AlignmentCheck and Extract-and-Evaluate monitors under diverse monitoring LLMs. Our findings suggest current monitoring-based agentic defenses are fundamentally fragile regardless of model scale.

Abstract: Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.

Abstract: GNSSs are vulnerable to attacks of two kinds: jamming (i.e. denying access to the signal) and spoofing (i.e. impersonating a legitimate satellite). These attacks have been extensively studied, and we have a myriad of countermeasures to mitigate them. In this paper we expose a new type of attack: SpAmming, which combines both approaches to achieve the same effects in a more subtle way.
  Exploiting the CDMA multiplexing present in most GNSSs, and through a spoofing attack, this approach leads the receiver to lose access to the signal of a legitimate satellite, which would be equivalent to a denial of service; but in this case the existing countermeasures against jamming or spoofing would not allow safeguarding its effectiveness, as it is neither of them.
  An experimental proof-of-concept is presented in which its impact is evaluated as a function of the previous state of the receiver. Using an SDR-based system developed at the Space Security Centre, the attack is executed against a cold-started receiver, a warm-started receiver, and a receiver that has already acquired the PVT solution and is navigating. Different attack configurations are also tested, starting from a raw emission of the false signal, to surgical Doppler effect configuration, code offset, etc. Although it is shown to be particularly successful against cold-started receivers, the results show that it is also effective in other scenarios, especially if accompanied by other attacks. We will conclude the article by outlining possible countermeasures to detect and, eventually, counteract it; and possible avenues of research to better understand its impact, especially for authenticated services such as OSNMA, and to characterize it in order to improve the response to similar attacks.

Abstract: Crypto-assets are a main segment of electronic markets, with growing trade volume and market share, yet there's no unified and comprehensive asset level taxonomy framework. This paper develops a multidimensional taxonomy for crypto-assets that connects technical design to market structure and regulation. Building on established taxonomy guideline and existing models, we derive dimensions from theory, regulatory frameworks, and case studies. We then map top 100 assets within the structure and provide several detailed case studies. The taxonomy covers technology standard, centralisation of critical resources, asset function, legal classification and mechanism designs of minting, yield, redemption. The asset mapping and case studies reveal recurring design patterns, capture features of edge cases that sit on boundaries of current categorisations, and document centralised control of nominal decentralised assets. This paper provides framework for systematic study for crypto markets, supports regulators in assessing token risks, and offers investors and digital platform designers a tool to compare assets when building or participate in electronic markets.

Abstract: Cyber attacks have become a serious threat to the security of software systems. Many organizations have built their security knowledge bases to safeguard against attacks and vulnerabilities. However, due to the time lag in the official release of security information, these security knowledge bases may not be well maintained, and using them to protect software systems against emergent security risks can be challenging. On the other hand, the security posts on online knowledge-sharing platforms contain many crowd security discussions and the knowledge in those posts can be used to enhance the security knowledge bases. This paper proposes SynAT, an automatic approach to synthesize attack trees from crowd security posts. Given a security post, SynAT first utilize the Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt learning to restrict the scope of sentences that may contain attack information; then it utilizes a transition-based event and relation extraction model to extract the events and relations simultaneously from the scope; finally, it applies heuristic rules to synthesize the attack trees with the extracted events and relations. An experimental evaluation is conducted on 5,070 Stack Overflow security posts, and the results show that SynAT outperforms all baselines in both event and relation extraction, and achieves the highest tree similarity in attack tree synthesis. Furthermore, SynAT has been applied to enhance HUAWEI's security knowledge base as well as public security knowledge bases CVE and CAPEC, which demonstrates SynAT's practicality.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, their real-world applicability has expanded significantly, accompanied by new security challenges. Most existing agent defense mechanisms adopt a mandatory checking paradigm, in which security validation is forcibly triggered at predefined stages of the agent lifecycle. In this work, we argue that effective agent security should be intrinsic and selective rather than architecturally decoupled and mandatory. We propose Spider-Sense framework, an event-driven defense framework based on Intrinsic Risk Sensing (IRS), which allows agents to maintain latent vigilance and trigger defenses only upon risk perception. Once triggered, the Spider-Sense invokes a hierarchical defence mechanism that trades off efficiency and precision: it resolves known patterns via lightweight similarity matching while escalating ambiguous cases to deep internal reasoning, thereby eliminating reliance on external models. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce S$^2$Bench, a lifecycle-aware benchmark featuring realistic tool execution and multi-stage attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spider-Sense achieves competitive or superior defense performance, attaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), with only a marginal latency overhead of 8.3\%.

Abstract: Chat template is a common technique used in the training and inference stages of Large Language Models (LLMs). It can transform input and output data into role-based and templated expressions to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, this also creates a breeding ground for novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we first reveal that the customizability of chat templates allows an attacker who controls the template to inject arbitrary strings into the system prompt without the user's notice. Building on this, we propose a training-free backdoor attack, termed BadTemplate. Specifically, BadTemplate inserts carefully crafted malicious instructions into the high-priority system prompt, thereby causing the target LLM to exhibit persistent backdoor behaviors. BadTemplate outperforms traditional backdoor attacks by embedding malicious instructions directly into the system prompt, eliminating the need for model retraining while achieving high attack effectiveness with minimal cost. Furthermore, its simplicity and scalability make it easily and widely deployed in real-world systems, raising serious risks of rapid propagation, economic damage, and large-scale misinformation. Furthermore, detection by major third-party platforms HuggingFace and LLM-as-a-judge proves largely ineffective against BadTemplate. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 benchmark datasets across 6 open-source and 3 closed-source LLMs, compared with 3 baselines, demonstrate that BadTemplate achieves up to a 100% attack success rate and significantly outperforms traditional prompt-based backdoors in both word-level and sentence-level attacks. Our work highlights the potential security risks raised by chat templates in the LLM supply chain, thereby supporting the development of effective defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite the advantages of decentralization and immutability, blockchain technology faces significant scalability and throughput limitations, which has prompted the exploration of off-chain solutions like payment channels. Adaptor signatures have been considered a promising primitive for constructing such channels due to their support for atomicity, offering an alternative to traditional hash-timelock contracts. However, standard adaptor signatures may reveal signer identity, raising potential privacy concerns. While ring signatures can mitigate this issue by providing anonymity, they often introduce high communication overhead, particularly in multi-account payment settings commonly used in UTXO-based blockchains like Monero. To address these limitations, we propose a Linkable Threshold Ring Adaptor Signature (LTRAS) scheme, which integrates the conditional binding of adaptor signatures, the multi-account payment of threshold ring signatures, and the linkability for preventing double-spending. The formal definition, security model and concrete construction of LTRAS are provided. We also analyze its security and evaluate its performance through theoretical analysis and experimental implementation. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieve significantly lower computation and communication overhead compared to existing schemes in large ring sizes and multi-account payment scenarios. Finally, we discuss its application in cross-chain atomic swaps, demonstrating its potential for enhancing privacy and efficiency in blockchain transactions.

Abstract: Phishing sites continue to grow in volume and sophistication. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze URLs, HTML, and rendered content to decide whether a website is a phishing site. While these approaches are promising, LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection (PI). Because attackers can fully control various elements of phishing sites, this creates the potential for PI that exploits the perceptual asymmetry between LLMs and humans: instructions imperceptible to end users can still be parsed by the LLM and can stealthily manipulate its judgment. The specific risks of PI in phishing detection and effective mitigation strategies remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of PI against multimodal LLM-based phishing detection. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy, defined by Attack Techniques and Attack Surfaces, that captures realistic PI strategies. Using this taxonomy, we implement diverse attacks and empirically study several representative LLM-based detection systems. The results show that phishing detection with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 remains vulnerable to PI. We then propose InjectDefuser, a defense framework that combines prompt hardening, allowlist-based retrieval augmentation, and output validation. Across multiple models, InjectDefuser significantly reduces attack success rates. Our findings clarify the PI risk landscape and offer practical defenses that improve the reliability of next-generation phishing countermeasures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have progressively shifted from signature-based techniques toward machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity.

Abstract: Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) integrates the privacy advantages of distributed training with the capability of self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, showing strong potential across applications. However, recent studies have shown that FSSL is also vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attacks are limited by their trigger design, which typically employs a global, uniform trigger that is easily detected, gets diluted during aggregation, and lacks robustness in heterogeneous client environments. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Driven multi-party Collusion Attack (ADCA). During local pre-training, malicious clients decompose the global trigger to find optimal local patterns. Subsequently, these malicious clients collude to form a malicious coalition and establish a collaborative optimization mechanism within it. In this mechanism, each submits its model updates, and an attention mechanism dynamically aggregates them to explore the best cooperative strategy. The resulting aggregated parameters serve as the initial state for the next round of training within the coalition, thereby effectively mitigating the dilution of backdoor information by benign updates. Experiments on multiple FSSL scenarios and four datasets show that ADCA significantly outperforms existing methods in Attack Success Rate (ASR) and persistence, proving its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Lightweight cryptography is becoming essential as emerging technologies in digital identity systems and Internet of Things verification continue to demand strong cryptographic assurance on devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy resources. As these technologies move into routine use, they demand cryptographic primitives that maintain strong security and deliver predictable performance through clear theoretical models of time complexity. Although NIST's lightweight cryptography project provides empirical evaluations of the ten finalist algorithms, a unified theoretical understanding of their time-complexity behavior remains absent. This work introduces a symbolic model that decomposes each scheme into initialization, data-processing, and finalization phases, enabling formal time-complexity derivation for all ten finalists. The results clarify how design parameters shape computational scaling on constrained mobile and embedded environments. The framework provides a foundation needed to distinguish algorithmic efficiency and guides the choice of primitives capable of supporting security systems in constrained environments.

Abstract: Data is the lifeblood of AI, yet much of the most valuable data remains locked in silos due to privacy and regulations. As a result, AI remains heavily underutilized in many of the most important domains, including healthcare, education, and finance. Synthetic data generation (SDG), i.e. the generation of artificial data with a synthesizer trained on real data, offers an appealing solution to make data available while mitigating privacy concerns, however existing SDG-as-a-service workflow require data holders to trust providers with access to private data.We propose FHAIM, the first fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) framework for training a marginal-based synthetic data generator on encrypted tabular data. FHAIM adapts the widely used AIM algorithm to the FHE setting using novel FHE protocols, ensuring that the private data remains encrypted throughout and is released only with differential privacy guarantees. Our empirical analysis show that FHAIM preserves the performance of AIM while maintaining feasible runtimes.

Abstract: Existing literature heavily relies on static analysis tools to evaluate LLMs for secure code generation and vulnerability detection. We reviewed 1,080 LLM-generated code samples, built a human-validated ground-truth, and compared the outputs of two widely used static security tools, CodeQL and Semgrep, against this corpus. While 61% of the samples were genuinely secure, Semgrep and CodeQL classified 60% and 80% as secure, respectively. Despite the apparent agreement in aggregate statistics, per-sample analysis reveals substantial discrepancies: only 65% of Semgrep's and 61% of CodeQL's reports correctly matched the ground truth. These results question the reliability of static analysis tools as sole evaluators of code security and underscore the need for expert feedback. Building on this insight, we propose a conceptual framework that persistently stores human feedback in a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, enabling LLMs to reuse past feedback for secure code generation and vulnerability detection.

Abstract: GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) have become a central component of open-source vulnerability disclosure and are widely used by developers and security tools. A distinctive feature of GHSA is that only a fraction of advisories are reviewed by GitHub, while the mechanisms associated with this review process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of GHSA review processes, analyzing over 288,000 advisories spanning 2019--2025. We characterize which advisories are more likely to be reviewed, quantify review delays, and identify two distinct review-latency regimes: a fast path dominated by GitHub Repository Advisories (GRAs) and a slow path dominated by NVD-first advisories. We further develop a queueing model that accounts for this dichotomy based on the structure of the advisory processing pipeline.

Abstract: Carrier phase positioning (CPP) can enable cm-level accuracy in next-generation wireless systems, while recent literature shows that accuracy remains high using phase-only measurements in distributed MIMO (D-MIMO). However, the impact of phase synchronization errors on such systems remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we first show that the proposed hyperbola intersection method achieves highly accurate positioning even in the presence of phase synchronization errors, when trained on appropriate data reflecting such impairments. We then introduce a deep learning (DL)-based D-MIMO antenna point (AP) selection framework that ensures high-precision localization under phase synchronization errors. Simulation results show that the proposed framework improves positioning accuracy compared to prior-art methods, while reducing inference complexity by approximately 19.7%.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical applications such as target tracking, where they must simultaneously sense dynamic environments, ensure reliable communication, and achieve precise control. A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method.

Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a prominent tool for imaging internal defects in cylindrical structures, such as columns, utility poles, and tree trunks. However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios. The code and database are available at: https://github.com/jwqian54/Migration-Assisted-DL.

Abstract: This paper proposes a user-centric split federated learning (UCSFL) framework for user-centric cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MIMO) networks to support split federated learning (SFL). In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model.

Abstract: Radio transmissions in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have gained significant interest for applications demanding precise device localization and trajectory estimation. This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.

Abstract: Estimating the depth of a monoharmonic sound source at a fixed range using a vertical linear array (VLA) is challenging in the absence of seabed environmental parameters, and relevant research remains scarce. The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment. In the Yellow Sea experiment, the depth estimation absolute errors by OCMS-D with a 4-second time window are less than 2.4 m. And the depth estimation absolute errors in the SWellEx-96 experiment with a 10-second time window are less than 5.4 m for the shallow source and less than 10.8 m for the deep source.

Abstract: The deployment of pixel-based antennas and fluid antenna systems (FAS) is hindered by prohibitive channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead. While radio maps enable proactive mode selection, reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging. Existing physics-agnostic or data-driven methods often fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity. We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Simulations show that PR-LRTC achieves a 4 dB gain over baselines at a 10% sampling ratio. It effectively preserves sharp shadowing edges, providing a robust, physics-compliant solution for low-overhead beam management.

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is an essential function of future wireless systems. Due to its large available bandwidth, millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC systems are able to achieve high sensing accuracy. In this paper, we consider the multiple base-station (BS) collaborative sensing problem in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) mmWave communication system. Our aim is to sense a remote target shape with the collected signals which consist of both the reflection and scattering signals. We first characterize the mmWave's scattering and reflection effects based on the Lambertian scattering model. Then we apply the periodogram technique to obtain rough scattering point detection, and further incorporate the subspace method to achieve more precise scattering and reflection point detection. Based on these, a reconstruction algorithm based on Hough Transform and principal component analysis (PCA) is designed for a single convex polygon target scenario. To improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction results, we propose a method to further fuse the scattering and reflection points. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for estimating plane-wave coefficients in sound field reconstruction, specifically addressing challenges posed by error-in-variable phase perturbations. Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian reciprocity calibration method that consistently ensures uplink and downlink channel reciprocity in repeater-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm is formulated under the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion. Its Bayesian framework incorporates complete statistical knowledge of the signal model, noise, and prior distributions, enabling a coherent design that achieves both low computational complexity and high calibration accuracy. To further enhance phase alignment accuracy, which is critical for calibration tasks, we develop a von Mises denoiser that exploits the fact that the target parameters lie on the circle in the complex plane. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MMSE algorithm achieves substantially improved estimation accuracy compared with conventional deterministic non-linear least-squares (NLS) methods, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits remarkably fast convergence, making it well suited for practical implementation.

Abstract: We consider a novel algorithm, for the completion of partially observed low-rank tensors, where each entry of the tensor can be chosen from a discrete finite alphabet set, such as in common image processing problems, where the entries represent the RGB values. The proposed low-rank tensor completion (TC) method builds on the conventional nuclear norm (NN) minimization-based low-rank TC paradigm, through the addition of a discrete-aware regularizer, which enforces discreteness in the objective of the problem, by an $\ell_0$-norm regularizer that is approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework, in order to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method both in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence, compared to the conventional state of-the-art (SotA) techniques, including NN minimization approaches, as well as a mixture of the latter with a matrix factorization approach.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds captured in rain or snow are often corrupted by weather-induced returns, which can degrade perception and safety-critical scene understanding. This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS.

Abstract: Cloud radio access networks (RANs) enable cost-effective management of mobile networks by dynamically scaling their capacity on demand. However, deploying adaptive controllers to implement such dynamic scaling in operational networks is challenging due to the risk of breaching service agreements and operational constraints. To mitigate this challenge, we present a novel method for learning the safe operating region of the RAN, i.e., the set of resource allocations and network configurations for which its specification is fulfilled. The method, which we call (C)ausal (O)nline (L)earning, operates in two online phases: an inference phase and an intervention phase. In the first phase, we passively observe the RAN to infer an initial safe region via causal inference and Gaussian process regression. In the second phase, we gradually expand this region through interventional Bayesian learning. We prove that COL ensures that the learned region is safe with a specified probability and that it converges to the full safe region under standard conditions. We experimentally validate COL on a 5G testbed. The results show that COL quickly learns the safe region while incurring low operational cost and being up to 10x more sample-efficient than current state-of-the-art methods for safe learning.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has attracted significant attention for human sensing and related applications. However, unsynchronized transmitters and receivers fundamentally preclude phase-coherent radar-like delay--Doppler analysis. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) path, i.e., the earliest-arriving direct path, as an over-the-air (OTA) reference for delay and phase, we propose an OTA LoS-path referencing scheme, termed LoSRef, that enables delay calibration and phase alignment in unsynchronized Wi-Fi systems. Unlike conventional Wi-Fi bistatic radar systems that rely on wired reference signals or dedicated reference antennas, the proposed LoSRef-based framework bridges the long-standing gap between conventional Wi-Fi sensing and Wi-Fi radar, enabling phase-coherent bistatic radar-like operation in a drop-in Wi-Fi sensing configuration. Through human gait and respiration experiments in indoor environments, we demonstrate that phase-coherent channel impulse responses and corresponding delay--Doppler responses are obtained using only commodity Wi-Fi devices. This enables physically interpretable human motion sensing, including gait-induced range variation and respiration-induced sub-wavelength displacement, as well as the extraction of target-induced dynamics up to 20 dB weaker than dominant static multipath components.

Abstract: The cloud computing paradigm underlines data center and telecommunication infrastructure design. Heavily leveraging virtualization, it slices hardware and software resources into smaller software units for greater flexibility of manipulation. Given the considerable benefits, several virtualization forms, with varying processing and communication overheads, emerged, including Full Virtualization and OS Virtualization. As a result, predicting packet throughput at the data plane turns out to be more challenging due to the additional virtualization overhead located at CPU, I/O, and network resources. This research presents a dataset of active network measurements data collected while varying various network parameters, including CPU affinity, frequency of echo packet injection, type of virtual network driver, use of CPU, I/O, or network load, and the number of concurrent VMs. The virtualization technologies used in the study include KVM, LXC, and Docker. The work examines their impact on a key network metric, namely, end-to-end latency. Also, it builds data models to evaluate the impact of a cloud computing environment on packet round-trip time. To explore data visualization, the dataset was submitted to pre-processing, correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. In addition, this paper provides a brief analysis of the dataset, demonstrating its use in developing machine learning-based systems for administrator decision-making.

Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.

Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

Abstract: The intermediate layers of deep networks can be characterised as a Gaussian process, in particular the Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy prescribes the limiting covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\text{CReLU}_{τ,m}(x)=\min(\max(x-τ,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verdú (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task. The code and checkpoints will be available upon acceptance \href{https://github.com/PhuTran1005/R-AVQA}{at here}

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. The code will be available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/TurboBoA.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

Abstract: Selecting the best data mixture is critical for successful Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

Abstract: Sets represent a fundamental abstraction across many types of data. To handle the unordered nature of set-structured data, models such as DeepSets and PointNet rely on fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (e.g., sum or max) -- a design choice that can hinder the transferability of learned embeddings and limits model expressivity. More recently, learnable aggregation functions have been proposed as more expressive alternatives. In this work, we advance this line of research by introducing the Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) -- a novel, trainable framework for learning a generalized measure of central tendency through an invertible neural function. We further propose quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs), which incorporate the NKM as a learnable aggregation function. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, QUANNs are universal approximators for a broad class of common set-function decompositions and, thanks to their invertible neural components, learn more structured latent representations. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, while learning embeddings that transfer effectively even to tasks that do not involve sets.

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

Abstract: Cybergrooming is an evolving threat to youth, necessitating proactive educational interventions. We propose StagePilot, an offline RL-based dialogue agent that simulates the stage-wise progression of grooming behaviors for prevention training. StagePilot selects conversational stages using a composite reward that balances user sentiment and goal proximity, with transitions constrained to adjacent stages for realism and interpretability. We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics. Among tested methods, the IQL+AWAC agent achieves the best balance between strategic planning and emotional coherence, reaching the final stage up to 43% more frequently than baselines while maintaining over 70% sentiment alignment.

Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.

Abstract: Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $ε-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is crucial in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity. Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering. Our code is available at https://github.com/colored-dye/concept_das.

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) transfer well, but adapting them to downstream tasks remains challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative. Although existing benchmarks have facilitated initial progress, they exhibit critical limitations in domain coverage, encoder flexibility, model diversity, and task scope, presenting significant challenges to fair evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenMAG, a comprehensive benchmark that integrates 19 datasets across 6 domains and incorporates 16 encoders to support both static and trainable feature encoding. OpenMAG further implements a standardized library of 24 state-of-the-art models and supports 8 downstream tasks, enabling fair comparisons within a unified framework. Through systematic assessment of necessity, data quality, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, we derive 14 fundamental insights into MAG learning to guide future advancements.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

Abstract: Selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation remain fragile in modern neural networks, even when tasks have underlying algebraic structure. In this work, we argue that these failures arise not solely from optimization or unlearning algorithms, but from how models structure their internal representations during training. We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning.

Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $δ_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

Abstract: Prompt injection is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents; yet, effective automated attacks remain largely unexplored from an optimization perspective. Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a "loss landscape" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks. Data and code are available at: https://cioutn.github.io/context-bench/.

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

Abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors are often tuned by a separate dataset deemed OOD with respect to the training distribution of a neural network (NN). OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns." Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets. We show that there can be significant variance in performance of detectors based on the adhoc dataset chosen in current literature, and thus even if such a dataset can be collected, the performance of the detector may be highly dependent on the choice. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the often neglected problem of tuning OOD detectors without a given ``OOD'' dataset. To this end, we present strong baselines as an attempt to approach this problem. Furthermore, we propose a new generic approach to OOD detector tuning that does not require any extra data other than those used to train the NN. We show that our approach improves over baseline methods consistently across higher-parameter OOD detector families, while being comparable across lower-parameter families.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds. This study underscores the importance of geometry aware dimensionality reduction in modern machine learning and data science applications.

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

Abstract: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or "Back-Projection", $x' = x + A^\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, "degradation" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

Abstract: The problem of designing codes for deletion-correction and synchronization has received renewed interest due to applications in DNA-based data storage systems that use nanopore sequencers as readout platforms. In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\log n$ for a constant $C\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.

Unlike previous approaches based on elliptic curves, our method applies to curves that are Kummer extensions of the rational function field, including hyperelliptic, norm-trace, and Hermitian curves. This allows QC codes with flexible co-index. Explicit parameter formulas are derived using known automorphism-group classifications.

Abstract: Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\times$ faster measurement, a 98\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.

Abstract: The sum-rank metric is the mixture of the Hamming and rank metrics. The sum-rank metric found its application in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are the sum-rank analogue of Reed-Solomon codes and strictly generalize both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes.
  In this work, we construct an explicit family of $\mathbb{F}_h$-linear sum-rank metric codes over arbitrary fields $\mathbb{F}_h$. Our construction enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $ρ$ of errors in the sum-rank metric with rate $1-ρ-\varepsilon$, for any desired $ρ\in (0,1)$ and $\varepsilon>0$. Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$.
  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius. To the best of our knowledge, this also constitutes the first explicit construction of positive-rate sum-rank metric codes that admit efficient list decoding beyond the unique decoding radius, thereby providing a new general framework for constructing efficiently decodable codes under the sum-rank metric.

Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases. To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Abstract: The Pinsker inequality lower bounds the Kullback--Leibler divergence $D_{\textrm{KL}}$ in terms of total variation and provides a canonical way to convert $D_{\textrm{KL}}$ control into $\lVert \cdot \rVert_1$-control. Motivated by applications to probabilistic prediction with Tsallis losses and online learning, we establish a generalized Pinsker inequality for the Bregman divergences $D_α$ generated by the negative $α$-Tsallis entropies -- also known as $β$-divergences. Specifically, for any $p$, $q$ in the relative interior of the probability simplex $Δ^K$, we prove the sharp bound \[
  D_α(p\Vert q) \ge \frac{C_{α,K}}{2}\cdot \|p-q\|_1^2, \] and we determine the optimal constant $C_{α,K}$ explicitly for every choice of $(α,K)$.

Abstract: In this work, we study the cross-layer timely throughput maximization for extended reality (XR) applications through uplink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) scheduling. Timely scheduling opportunities are characterized by the peak age of information (PAoI)-metric and are incorporated into a network-side optimization problem as constraints modeling user satisfaction. The problem being NP-hard, we resort to a signaling-free, weighted proportional fair-based iterative heuristic algorithm, where the weights are derived with respect to the PAoI metric. Extensive numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of XR capacity without sacrificing the overall system throughput.

Abstract: Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ ("weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as "waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.
  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.
