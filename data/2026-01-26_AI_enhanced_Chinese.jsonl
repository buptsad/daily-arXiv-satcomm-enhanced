An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery.

This paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT scheme to support batteryless sensor (BLS) networks in remote areas. In this system, BLSs harvest energy from the UAV and utilize the harvested energy to transmit the collected data back to the UAV. The goal is to maximize the collected data volume and fairness index while minimizing the UAV energy consumption. To achieve these objectives, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV trajectory. Due to the non-convexity and dynamic nature of the problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, this algorithm integrates prioritized experience replay and the performer module to enhance system stability and accelerate convergence.

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Considering a large set of gestures, distinct patterns are difficult to be captured by learning algorithms using backscattered received signal strength (RSS) and phase signals. This is because these features often exhibit similarities across signals from different gestures. To address this limitation, we explore the estimation of Angle of Arrival (AoA) as a distinguishing feature, since AoA characteristically varies during body motion. To ensure reliable estimation in our system, which employs Smart Antenna Switching (SAS), we first validate AoA estimation using the Multiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm while the tags are fixed at specific angles. Building on this, we propose an AoA tracking method based on Kalman smoothing. Our analysis demonstrates that, while RSS and phase alone are insufficient for distinguishing certain gesture data, AoA tracking can effectively differentiate them. To evaluate the effectiveness of AoA tracking, we implement gesture recognition system benchmarks and show that incorporating AoA features significantly boosts their performance.

The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

The cellular network coverage may be available for a limited range from the antenna side lobes, with poor connectivity further exacerbated by UAV flight dynamics. In this work, we propose TransfoREM, a 3D Radio Environment Map (REM) generation method that combines deterministic channel models and real-world data to map terrestrial network coverage at higher altitudes. At the core of our solution is a transformer model that translates radio propagation mapping into a sequence prediction task to construct REMs. Our results demonstrate that TransfoREM offers improved interpolation capability on real-world data compared against conventional Kriging and other machine learning (ML) techniques. Furthermore, TransfoREM is designed for holistic integration into cellular networks at the base station (BS) level, where it can build REMs, which can then be leveraged for enhanced resource allocation, interference management, and spatial spectrum utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The core novelty lies in a virtual flux observer-based synchronization and load angle control method. The terminal voltage of the converter is directly regulated to provide voltage-source behavior. The control parameters are designed for decoupling and pole placement. The proposed method exhibits strong robustness in stability and dynamical performance across varying and uncertain grid strengths. The robust control performance of the proposed method is first demonstrated by small-signal analysis, then validated by experiments on a 20 kVA power conversion system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \\textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-\\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA).

This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the \"cocktail party\" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u540c\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u542c\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528 wav2vec\u202f2.0+CNN \u4e0e BrainNetwork \u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230 72.70% \u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 AAD \u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cc\u8033\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u9e21\u5c3e\u9152\u4f1a\uff09\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u542c\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u91c7\u7528 wav2vec\u202f2.0 \u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42 1D CNN \u7f16\u7801\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528 BrainNetwork \u67b6\u6784\u5bf9 EEG \u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3) \u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97 EEG \u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "result": "\u5728 diotic EEG \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 72.70% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u7684 AAD \u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8 22.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u65e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u540c\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 EEG \u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u542c\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u89e3\u7801\uff08AAD\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5411\u7684 AAD \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design.

Leveraging verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proof techniques, FC-GUARD enables fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges without revealing users' PII or fiat account details. This breaks the linkage between users' real-world identities and their cryptocurrency addresses, thereby upholding anonymity, a fundamental expectation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In addition, FC-GUARD complies with key regulations over cryptocurrency usage, such as know-your-customer requirements and auditability for tax reporting obligations by integrating a lawful de-anonymization mechanism that allows the auditing authority to identify misbehaving users.

A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias.

The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data.

Submitted to an IEEE journal for possible publication", "summary": "Cell-free networks leverage distributed access points (APs) to achieve macro-diversity, yet their performance is often constrained by large disparities in channel quality arising from user geometry and blockages. To address this, rotatable antennas (RAs) add a lightweight hardware degree of freedom by steering the antenna boresight toward dominant propagation directions to strengthen unfavorable links, thereby enabling the network to better exploit macro-diversity for higher and more uniform performance. This paper investigates an RA-enabled cell-free downlink network and formulates a max-min rate problem that jointly optimizes transmit beamforming and antenna orientations. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop an alternating-optimization-based algorithm that iteratively updates the beamformers via a second-order cone program (SOCP) and optimizes the antenna orientations using successive convex approximation. To reduce complexity, we further propose an efficient two-stage scheme that first designs orientations by maximizing a proportional-fair log-utility using manifold-aware Frank-Wolfe updates, and then computes the beamformers using an SOCP-based design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed orientation-aware designs achieve a substantially higher worst-user rate than conventional beamforming-only benchmarks. Furthermore, larger antenna directivity enhances fairness with proper orientation but can degrade the worst-user performance otherwise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To mitigate this problem, we propose NOIR, the first framework to protect the client's prompts and generated code from the cloud. NOIR uses an encoder and a decoder at the client to encode and send the prompts' embeddings to the cloud to get enriched embeddings from the LLM, which are then decoded to generate the code locally at the client. Since the cloud can use the embeddings to infer the prompt and the generated code, NOIR introduces a new mechanism to achieve indistinguishability, a local differential privacy protection at the token embedding level, in the vocabulary used in the prompts and code, and a data-independent and randomized tokenizer on the client side. These components effectively defend against reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by an honest-but-curious cloud. Extensive analysis and results using open-source LLMs show that NOIR significantly outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks, including the Evalplus (MBPP and HumanEval, Pass@1 of 76.7 and 77.4), and BigCodeBench (Pass@1 of 38.7, only a 1.77% drop from the original LLM) under strong privacy against attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOIR\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5f15\u5165\u52a0\u5bc6\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u4fdd\u969cLLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u83b7\u53d6\u5546\u4e1a\u673a\u5bc6\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u53d1\u9001\u81f3\u4e91\u7aef\uff0c\u4e91\u7aef\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u672c\u5730\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4e3a\u963b\u6b62\u4e91\u7aef\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\uff0cNOIR\u5f15\u5165\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728Evalplus\uff08MBPP\u3001HumanEval\uff09\u548cBigCodeBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cNOIR\u5728\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u8fbe\u6210Pass@1\u5206\u522b\u4e3a76.7%\u300177.4%\u548c38.7%\uff0c\u4ec5\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbLLM\u4e0b\u964d1.77%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "NOIR framework\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u88ab\u4e91\u7aef\u7a83\u53d6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u539f\u59cbLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This complexity, however, increases power consumption, making the systems energy-intensive. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a novel generation of neural networks inspired by the highly efficient human brain. By emulating its event-driven and energy-efficient mechanisms, SNNs enable low-power, real-time signal processing. They differ from ANNs in two key ways: they exhibit inherent temporal dynamics and process and transmit information as short binary signals called spikes. Despite their promise, major challenges remain, e.g., identifying optimal learning rules and effective neural encoding. This thesis investigates the design of SNN-based receivers for nonlinear time-invariant frequency-selective channels. Backpropagation through time with surrogate gradients is identified as a promising update rule and the novel quantization encoding (QE) as promising neural encoding. Given the model of the intensity modulation with direct detection link, we compare two different receiver architectures based on equalization performance and spike count. Using decision feedback and QE achieves both strong performance and low spike counts. Notably, SNN-based receivers significantly outperform ANN-based counterparts. We furthermore introduce policy gradient-based update (PGU), an reinforcement learning-based update algorithm that requires no backpropagation. Using PGU, encoding parameters are optimized, drastically reducing runtime, complexity, and spikes per inference while maintaining performance.

However, practical implementations of DNA storage are constrained by errors introduced during synthesis, preservation, and sequencing processes, and traditional error-correcting codes remain vulnerable to noise levels that exceed predefined thresholds. Here, we developed a Partitioning-mapping with Jump-rotating (PJ) encoding scheme, which exhibits exceptional noise resilience. PJ removes cross-strand information dependencies so that strand loss manifests as localized gaps rather than catastrophic file failure. It prioritizes file decodability under arbitrary noise conditions and leverages AI-based inference to enable controllable recovery of digital information. For the intra-strand encoding, we develop a jump-rotating strategy that relaxes sequence constraints relative to conventional rotating codes and provides tunable information density via an adjustable jump length. Based on this encoding architecture, the original file information can always be decoded and recovered under any strand loss ratio, with fidelity degrading smoothly as damage increases. We demonstrate that original files can be effectively recovered even with 10% strand loss, and machine learning datasets stored under these conditions retain their classification performance. Experiments further confirmed that PJ successfully decodes image files after extreme environmental disturbance using accelerated aging and high-intensity X-ray irradiation.

Additionally, to support useful application features, such systems increasingly have a large rich operating system (OS) at the cost of potential security bugs.

Many past approaches to this problem completely isolate time-sensitive programs with a hypervisor; however, this prevents the programs from accessing useful OS services\n  We introduce Ringmaster, a novel framework that enables enclaves or TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) to asynchronously access rich, but potentially untrusted, OS services via Linux's io_uring. When service is denied by the untrusted OS, enclaves continue to operate on Ringmaster's minimal ARM TrustZone kernel with access to small, critical device drivers. This approach balances the need for secure, time-sensitive processing with the convenience of rich OS services. Additionally, Ringmaster supports large unmodified programs as enclaves, offering lower overhead compared to existing systems. We demonstrate how Ringmaster helps us build a working highly-secure system with minimal engineering.

In the proposed approach, the phase lock loop bandwidth is adapted according to the inertial navigation system information. The latter has the advantage to be easily implementable on a System-on-Chip component such as an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), and can be implemented with minor modifications on an existing GNSS receiver platform. Moreover, compared to classical vector-based solutions, the proposed architecture decodes the navigation message in the loop, without the need to run scalar loops in parallel or having to store pre-downloaded ephemeris data. This architecture therefore does not increase the area occupied on the FPGA and does not use additional resources for storage. The proposed GNSS receiver architecture uses GPS L1/C and Galileo E1 signals and is composed of one acquisition module and 16 tracking channels (8 GPS and 8 Galileo) which are implemented within a FPGA (Zynq-Ultrascale).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5411\u91cf\u8ddf\u8e2a/\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u73af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684GNSS/INS\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728FPGA\u4e0a\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0GPS+Galileo\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u661f\u5386\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347GNSS/INS\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11FPGA\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5347\u7ea7\u7684GNSS\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u73af\u7684GNSS\u63a5\u6536\u673a\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u73af\u5e26\u5bbd\u6839\u636e\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u822a\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u5e76\u884c\u6807\u91cf\u73af\u6216\u9884\u4e0b\u8f7d\u661f\u5386\uff1b\u5c06GPS L1/C\u4e0e Galileo E1 \u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e16\u4e2a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u901a\u9053\u96c6\u6210\u81f3Zynq\u2011UltraScale FPGA\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5728Zynq\u2011UltraScale\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u63a5\u6536\u673a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u91c7\u96c6\u6a21\u5757\u548c16\u6761\u8ddf\u8e2a\u901a\u9053\uff08GPS8 + Galileo8\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u9762\u79ef\u6216\u989d\u5916\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u5bfc\u822a\u8054\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u96c5\u7684GNSS/INS\u8d85\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u65e2\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86FPGA\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u53c8\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5b58\u50a8\u5bfc\u822a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728SoC\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

The main basic contribution is in defining a notion of a Kraft matrix and in establishing the fact that a necessary condition for information losslessness of a finite-state encoder is that none of the eigenvalues of this matrix have modulus larger than unity, or equivalently, the generalized Kraft inequality asserts that the spectral radius of the Kraft matrix cannot exceed one. For the important special case where the FS encoder is irreducible, we derive several equivalent forms of this inequality, which are based on well known formulas for spectral radius. It also turns out that in the irreducible case, Kraft sums are bounded by a constant, independent of the block length, and thus cannot grow even in any subexponential rate.

This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this context, the growing interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices must be balanced against stringent constraints on computational complexity and memory while supporting high-order modulation. Beyond accurate hard detection, reliable soft information is equally critical, as modern receivers rely on soft-input channel decoding, imposing additional requirements on the detector design. In this work, we propose recurSIC, a lightweight learning-based MIMO detection framework that is structurally inspired by successive interference cancellation (SIC) and incorporates learned processing stages. It generates reliable soft information via multi-path hypothesis tracking with a tunable complexity parameter while requiring only a single forward pass and a minimal parameter count.

We show that our framework not only combines control and software structure but also considers the real-time requirements of the control system during performance optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3aSOA\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528A*\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aA*\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u8282\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6210\u672c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7eb5\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Our first key contribution is an explicit upper bound of generalized quadratic Gauss sums which is obtained by recursively applying Paris' asymptotic expansion and then bounding it by leveraging the fast convergence property of the Fibonacci zeta function. Building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected Chu sequences and Alltop sequences. For the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full Alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes.

However, intelligent attacks represented by semantic eavesdropping pose severe challenges to the security of SemCom. To address this challenge, Semantic Steganographic Communication (SemSteCom) achieves ``invisible'' encryption by implicitly embedding private semantic information into cover modality carriers. The state-of-the-art study has further introduced generative diffusion models to directly generate stega images without relying on original cover images, effectively enhancing steganographic capacity. Nevertheless, the recovery process of private images is highly dependent on the guidance of private semantic keys, which may be inferred by intelligent eavesdroppers, thereby introducing new security threats. To address this issue, we propose an Agentic AI-driven SemSteCom (AgentSemSteCom) scheme, which includes semantic extraction, digital token controlled reference image generation, coverless steganography, semantic codec, and optional task-oriented enhancement modules. The proposed AgentSemSteCom scheme obviates the need for both cover images and private semantic keys, thereby boosting steganographic capacity while reinforcing transmission security.

However, this defense paradigm assumes such watermarks are inherently resistant to removal. We challenge this assumption with DeMark, a query-free black-box attack framework that targets defensive image watermarking schemes for deepfakes. DeMark exploits latent-space vulnerabilities in encoder-decoder watermarking models through a compressive sensing based sparsification process, suppressing watermark signals while preserving perceptual and structural realism appropriate for deepfakes. Across eight state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, DeMark reduces watermark detection accuracy from 100% to 32.9% on average while maintaining natural visual quality, outperforming existing attacks. We further evaluate three defense strategies, including image super resolution, sparse watermarking, and adversarial training, and find them largely ineffective. These results demonstrate that current encoder decoder watermarking schemes remain vulnerable to latent-space manipulations, underscoring the need for more robust watermarking methods to safeguard against deepfakes.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeMark\u653b\u51fb\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u4e03\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u81f332.9%\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u6c34\u5370\u6613\u53d7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u5236\u66f4\u5f3a\u5bb9\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6311\u6230\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8a2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5904\u7406\u6765\u653b\u51fb\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6291\u5236\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6c34\u5370\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u4e0a\uff0cDeMark\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece100%\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u5e73\u574732.9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u4e09\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u5c42\u9762\u653b\u51fb\u2014\u2014DeMark\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Adoption evolves through social contagion and perceived benefits, while opinions are shaped by social interactions and feedback from adoption levels. Individuals may also stop adopting virtuous behavior due to external constraints or shifting perceptions, affecting overall diffusion. After the stability analysis of equilibria, both in the presence and absence of adopters, we introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that optimizes interventions by shaping opinions rather than directly enforcing adoption. This nudge-based control strategy allows policymakers to influence diffusion indirectly, making interventions more effective and scalable. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in the absence of control, adoption stagnates, whereas MPC-driven interventions sustain and enhance adoption across communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We formulate the system as an impulse-controlled piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP) and derive coupled integral average-cost optimality equations via the dynamic programming principle, thereby avoiding the smoothness assumptions typically required for an average-cost Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI) characterization. A key invariance in the busy phase collapses the dynamics onto a one-dimensional busy-start boundary, reducing preemption control to an optimal stopping problem. Building on this structure, we develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm with heavy-tail acceleration, employing a hybrid (uniform/log-spaced) action grid and a far-field linear closure. Simulations under Pareto and log-normal service times demonstrate substantial improvements over AoI-optimal non-preemptive sampling and zero-wait baselines, achieving up to a 30x reduction in average cost in heavy-tailed regimes. Finally, simulations uncover a counterintuitive insight: under preemption, delay variance, despite typically being a liability, can become a strategic advantage for information freshness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u8fd0\u7528\u51b2\u6fc0\u63a7\u5236PDMP\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u62a2\u5360\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u79ef\u5206\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u505c\u6b62\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u63a8\u51fa\u5e26\u91cd\u5c3e\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u591a30\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\u5728\u62a2\u5360\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5305\u542b\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u62a2\u5360\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u62a2\u5360\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672cHJB-QVI\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51b2\u6fc0\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b(PDMP)\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8026\u5408\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5c06\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u964d\u7ef4\u81f3\u4e00\u7ef4\u5fd9\u8d77\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u628a\u62a2\u5360\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u505c\u6b62\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u91cd\u5c3e\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u5747\u5300/\u5bf9\u6570\u95f4\u8ddd\u52a8\u4f5c\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u7ebf\u6027\u95ed\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728Pareto\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eAoI\u6700\u4f18\u975e\u62a2\u5360\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u96f6\u7b49\u5f85\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe30\u500d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u53e6\u5916\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u62a2\u5360\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u901a\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u62a2\u5360\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u62a2\u5360\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6709\u5229\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Moreover, diverse usage scenarios call for comprehensive functionality. To address these challenges, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient crypto-processor for FrodoKEM. A multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme is introduced to enable efficient multi-module scheduling and minimize operational latency. Furthermore, a high-speed, reconfigurable parallel multiplier array is integrated to handle intensive matrix computations under diverse computation patterns, significantly enhancing hardware efficiency. In addition, a compact memory scheduling strategy shortens the lifespan of intermediate matrices, thereby reducing overall storage requirements. The proposed design provides full support for all FrodoKEM security levels and protocol phases. It consumes 13467 LUTs, 6042 FFs, and 14 BRAMs on an Artix-7 FPGA and achieves the fastest reported execution time.

The attacks were extensively studied in Bitcoin (SP'15, SP'20, CCS'21, SP'23) and Monero (NDSS'25), but their practicality against Ethereum nodes remains underexplored, particularly in the post-Merge settings.\n  We present the first end-to-end implementation of an eclipse attack targeting Ethereum (2.0 version) execution-layer nodes. Our attack exploits the bootstrapping and peer management logic of Ethereum to fully isolate a node upon restart. We introduce a multi-stage strategy that majorly includes (i) poisoning the node's discovery table via unsolicited messages, (ii) infiltrating Ethereum's DNS-based peerlist by identifying and manipulating the official DNS crawler, and (iii) hijacking idle incoming connection slots across the network to block benign connections. Our DNS list poisoning is the first in the cryptocurrency context and requires only 28 IP addresses over 100 days. Slots hijacking raises outgoing redirection success from 45\\% to 95\\%. We validate our approach through controlled experiments on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet and broad measurements on the mainnet. Our findings demonstrate that over 80\\% of public nodes do not leave sufficient idle capacity for effective slots occupation, highlighting the feasibility and severity of the threat.

We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability.

The proposed approach enables the determination of optimal parameters for any target distribution matcher rate. Specifically, lower bounds on energy loss, rate loss, and memory requirements are analytically estimated for HiDM architectures approximating the Maxwell Boltzmann (MB) distribution. A semi analytical optimization framework is employed to jointly optimize rate and energy loss, allowing the selection of the number of hierarchical layers, memory size, and block length required to optimize channel capacity. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated through probabilistic amplitude shaping of 16QAM (PAS 16QAM), showing good agreement between analytical predictions and simulated results. The proposed analytical tool facilitates the design of HiDM structures that are compatible with practical hardware and implementation constraints, such as those imposed by state-of-the-art application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore, the performance of the optimized HiDM structure, incorporating layer selection based on lower-bound energy loss, is evaluated over the AWGN channel in terms of normalized generalized mutual information (NGMI) as a function of the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). At a net data rate of 200 Gbps with 25% forward error correction (FEC) overhead, the proposed scheme achieves a shaping gain improvement of 2.8% compared to previously reported solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u80fd\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316HiDM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u572816QAM PAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62.8%\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6982\u7387\u5f62\u72b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3ASIC/FPGAs\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3001\u901f\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5c42\u6570\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5757\u957f\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf916QAM\u6982\u7387\u5e45\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572816QAM PAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u826f\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0200 Gbps 25% FEC\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f80\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u53472.8%\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u5668\uff08HiDM\uff09\u5728\u6982\u7387\u5f62\u72b6\u661f\u5ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u901f\u7387\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02.8%\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Specifically, in twenty questions estimation, there are two players: an oracle and a questioner. The questioner aims to estimate target variables by posing queries to the oracle that knows the variables and using noisy responses to form reliable estimates. Typically, there are adaptive and non-adaptive query procedures. In adaptive querying, one designs the current query using previous queries and their noisy responses while in non-adaptive querying, all queries are posed simultaneously. Generally speaking, adaptive query procedures yield better performance. However, adaptive querying leads to privacy concerns, which were first studied by Tsitsiklis, Xu and Xu (COLT 2018) and by Xu, Xu and Yang (AISTATS 2021) for the noiseless case, where the oracle always provides correct answers to queries. In this paper, we generalize the above results to the more practical noisy case, by proposing a two-stage private query procedure, analyzing its non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic achievable performance and discussing the impact of privacy concerns. Furthermore, when specialized to the noiseless case, our private query procedure achieves better performance than above-mentioned query procedures (COLT 2018, AISTATS 2021).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u79c1\u5bc6\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e8c\u5341\u95ee\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u51f8\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u201c\u4e8c\u5341\u95ee\u201d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u517c\u987e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u79c1\u5bc6\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u4e0e\u4e8c\u9636\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u6298\u8877\uff1b\u5f53\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b64\u524d\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6848\uff08COLT\u202f2018\u3001AISTATS\u202f2021\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \\$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The fading severity is quantified in terms of Hyper-Rayleigh Regimes (HRRs) (i.e., full-HRR (worst-case conditions), strong-, weak-, and no-HRR), and the channel model used (Inverse Power Lomax (IPL)) was chosen since it can account for all HRRs. The research presents the derived closed-form channel coefficient envelope statistics for the single IRS-element channel with IPL statistics in both subchannels and total IRS-assisted channel, as well as tight approximations for the channel coefficient and instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) statistics for the latter. The derived expressions helped estimate channel parameters corresponding to the specific HRRs of the total channel and demonstrate that while both single links (i.e., ''source-IRS'' and ''IRS-destination'') are in full-HRR, the minimum number of IRS elements needed to bring the total IRS-assisted link (''source-IRS-destination'') out of full-HRR is no less than $6$ (for the whole range on the IPL scale parameter corresponding full-HRR).

We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment.

By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \\textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts.

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes.

However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse.

To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections.

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u95ee\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u5982LLM\uff09\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f17\u591a\u53ef\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548cLLM\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b54\u6848\u6821\u6b63\u5e76\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c", "result": "\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9LLM\u7b49\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u5982LLM\uff09\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848"}}

While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data.

Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lov\u00e1sz's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.\n  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions.

In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map.

In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero.

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut.

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space.

Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\u03bb_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9510\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e3a\u8f74\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfHessian\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc710\u6b65\u524d\u5411\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9510\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u76f8\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u57287B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdfJacobian\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728 OLMo-2 \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u9996\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5173\u952e\u9510\u5ea6\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u9510\u5316\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u7a33\u5b9a(SOS)\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u9510\u5ea6\u63ed\u793a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u9510\u5ea6\uff08critical sharpness\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u7248\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349Hessian\u9510\u5ea6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}
