The proposed scheme allows a miner to probabilistically attest to having searched specified regions of the nonce space in earlier mining rounds, while concurrently earning rewards for performing productive work for a new block or pool share. This capability enables miners belonging to a mining pools to audit another miner's claimed effort retroactively, thereby allowing the probabilistic detection of block withholding attacks (BWAs) without requiring trusted hardware or trusted third parties. As a consequence, the construction supports the design of decentralized mining pools in which work attribution is verifiable and withholding incentives are substantially reduced. The scheme preserves the fundamental properties of conventional PoW, including public verifiability and difficulty adjustment, while adding an orthogonal auditability layer tailored to pool-based mining. Finally, while a full deployment of APoW in Bitcoin would require a consensus rule change and minor modifications to mining ASICs, the construction remains practically useful even without consensus changes, for instance, as a pool-level auditing mechanism that enables verifiable pay-for-auditing using existing pool reserves."}

Cyber and physical replicas are used to disrupt attacker reconnaissance and enhance defensive effectiveness. We propose a CVE-based utility function to identify the most critical vulnerabilities and demonstrate that coordinated multilayer deception outperforms single-layer and baseline strategies in improving defender utility across both CVSS versions."}

Existing approaches rely on manually crafted transformation rules to preserve watermarked code functionality or manipulate token-generation probabilities at inference time, which are prone to compilation errors. To address these challenges, SWaRL employs a reinforcement learning-based co-training framework that uses compiler feedback for functional correctness and a jointly trained confidential verifier as a reward signal to maintain watermark detectability. Furthermore, SWaRL employs low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during fine-tuning, allowing the learned watermark information to be transferable across model updates. Extensive experiments show that SWaRL achieves higher watermark detection accuracy compared to prior methods while fully maintaining watermarked code functionality. The LoRA-based signature embedding steers the base model to generate and solve code in a watermark-specific manner without significant computational overhead. Moreover, SWaRL exhibits strong resilience against refactoring and adversarial transformation attacks."}

One of the fundamental steps in the pre-silicon security verification of a hardware design is the identification of security assets, as it substantially influences downstream security verification tasks, such as threat modeling, security property generation, and vulnerability detection. Traditionally, assets are determined manually by security experts, requiring significant time and expertise. To address this challenge, we present LAsset, a novel automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify security assets from both hardware design specifications and register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions. The framework performs structural and semantic analysis to identify intra-module primary and secondary assets and derives inter-module relationships to systematically characterize security dependencies at the design level. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy, reaching up to 90% recall rate in SoC design, and 93% recall rate in IP designs. This automation in asset identification significantly reduces manual overhead and supports a scalable path forward for secure hardware development."}

The modifications overcome the challenging problems of rank deficiency when applying the UKF to parameter estimation. Rank deficiency usually means only a small subset of parameters can be estimated. Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples. We compare this to the original implementation of the UKF algorithm for parameter estimation and demonstrate a significant improvement."}

By employing a constructed state-space model, two control schemes are developed in a unified framework: a state-feedback controller and a sliding mode controller, both integrated with a second-order DOb. The proposed framework achieves high-performance motion control by precisely estimating and compensating for internal and external disturbances, while preserving the nominal dynamic response. Simulation results demonstrate that pole-placement-based controllers are highly sensitive to disturbances, whereas LQR-based controllers offer improved robustness at the expense of slower dynamics. By incorporating DOb, robustness is significantly enhanced without degrading time response, and the LQR controller can be tuned solely for performance optimization. Experimental results confirm that the proposed robust position controllers can be implemented in real world applications. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach and lay the foundation for future investigations on robust stability and performance under different stiffness settings."}

To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse. Experiments on large semi-synthetic transaction network data show that DTAS finds solutions close to the optimal ILP within seconds, offering a fast and practical way to enforce transaction caps fairly and efficiently."}

They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world."}

Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models."}

However, conventional handover triggers based on instantaneous channel measurements are prone to failures and the ping-pong effect due to outdated or inaccurate channel state information. To address this, we introduce Deep-SIC, a knowledge-based channel prediction model that employs a Transformer-based approach to predict channel quality and optimise handover decisions. Deep-SIC is a unique model that utilises Partially Decoded Data (PDD), a byproduct of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in NOMA, as a feedback signal to improve its predictions continually. This special purpose enables learners to learn quickly and stabilise their learning. Our model learns 68\\% faster than existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Graph-NOMA, while offering verifiable guarantees of stability and resilience to user mobility (Theorem~2). When simulated at the system level, it can be shown that our strategy can substantially enhance network performance: the handover failure rate can be reduced by up to 40\\%, and the ping-pong effect can be mitigated, especially at vehicular speeds (e.g., 60 km/h). Moreover, Deep-SIC has a 20\\% smaller normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) in low-SNR situations than state-of-the-art algorithms with linear computational complexity, $O(K)$.

We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents.

Digitally signed transcripts from educational institutions are accepted, and verifiable self-issued skill credentials are derived inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) by a natural language processing pipeline that analyzes formal records (e.g., transcripts, syllabi) and informal artifacts. All verification and job-skill matching are performed inside the enclave with selective disclosure, so raw credentials and private keys remain enclave-confined. Job matching relies solely on attested skill vectors and is invariant to non-skill resume fields, thereby reducing opportunities for screening bias.The NLP component was evaluated on sample learner data; the mapping follows the validated Syllabus-to-O*NET methodology,and a stability test across repeated runs observed <5% variance in top-ranked skills. Formal security statements and proof sketches are provided showing that derived credentials are unforgeable and that sensitive information remains confidential.

Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces.

However, scaling the number of coordinated nodes introduces challenges in feature extraction from large datasets, and transparent data fusion. We propose an end-to-end framework that operates directly on raw radar data. Each radar node employs a lightweight 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local features. A self-attention fusion block then models inter-node relationships and performs adaptive information fusion. Local feature extraction reduces the input dimensionality by up to 480x. This significantly lowers communication overhead and latency. The attention mechanism provides inherent interpretability by quantifying the contribution of each radar node. A hybrid supervised contrastive loss further improves feature separability, especially for fine-grained and imbalanced activity classes. Experiments on real-world distributed Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces model complexity by 70.8\\%, while achieving higher average accuracy than baseline approaches. Overall, the framework enables transparent, efficient, and low-overhead distributed radar sensing."}

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm."}

Rather than producing isolated outputs, such systems operate continuously under feedback, adaptation, and scale, reshaping physical flows, human behavior, and institutional practice over time. In these settings, socially unacceptable outcomes rarely arise from singular faults or explicit policy violations. Instead, they emerge through cumulative execution trajectories enabled by repetition, concurrency, and feedback.\n  This paper advances the formal foundation of the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) by making its central requirement explicit: responsibility is fundamentally a reachability property of system execution. A system is responsible iff its execution semantics prevent entry into inadmissible global configurations, regardless of local performance gains or optimization objectives. Responsibility failures are therefore not objective-level errors, but execution-level failures of trajectory control.\n  To operationalize this perspective, we introduce Petri nets as an execution-level formalism for responsible autonomous systems. We show how SRS value commitments correspond to forbidden markings, safeguards to structural constraints on transition firing, auditing to monitoring of reachability pressure, and governance to legitimate modification of execution structure. Embedding Petri-net reachability within the SRS architecture internalizes responsibility as a structural invariant rather than an external objective or post-hoc mechanism.\n  These results establish the Social Responsibility Stack as an executable responsibility architecture and position reachability-based execution semantics as a necessary foundation for responsible autonomy in feedback-rich cyber-physical and socio-technical systems."}

While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability."}

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces."}

We formalize a corresponding threat model and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of targeted manipulations of real data (e.g., label flipping and feature-importance-based interventions) on the quality of generated synthetic data.

Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) exploits device-specific, hard-to-forge physical-layer impairments for identification, and is promising for IoT and unmanned systems. In practice, however, new devices continuously join deployed systems while per-class training data are limited. Conventional static training and naive replay of stored exemplars are impractical due to growing class cardinality, storage cost, and privacy concerns.\n  We propose an exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework tailored to RFF recognition. Starting from a pretrained feature extractor, we freeze the backbone during incremental stages and train only a classifier together with lightweight Adapter modules that perform small task-specific feature adjustments. For each class we fit a diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the backbone features and sample pseudo-features from these fitted distributions to rehearse past classes without storing raw signals. To improve robustness under few-shot conditions we introduce a time-domain random-masking augmentation and adopt a multi-teacher distillation scheme to compress stage-wise Adapters into a single inference Adapter, trading off accuracy and runtime efficiency.\n  We evaluate the method on large, self-collected ADS-B datasets: the backbone is pretrained on 2,175 classes and incremental experiments are run on a disjoint set of 669 classes with multiple rounds and step sizes. Against several representative baselines, our approach consistently yields higher average accuracy and lower forgetting, while using substantially less storage and avoiding raw-data retention.\n  The proposed pipeline is reproducible and provides a practical, low-storage solution for RFF deployment in resource- and privacy-constrained environments."}

In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees."}

Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework.\n  The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction."}

These tools must support efficient evaluation of key performance metrics such as coverage and radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure, inform network design decisions, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy pre defined network specific heterogeneous performance goals."}

This has led to the research and development of interoperable solutions allowing blockchains to connect together.

Therefore, reliable channel prediction methods become essential to support robust detection and decoding in OTFS systems. In this paper, we propose conditional variational autoencoder for channel prediction (CVAE4CP) method, which learns the conditional distribution of OTFS delay Doppler channel coefficients given physical system and mobility parameters. By incorporating these parameters as conditioning information, the proposed method enables the prediction of future channel coefficients before their actual realization, while accounting for inherent channel uncertainty through a low dimensional latent representation. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive simulations under high mobility conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that CVAE4CP consistently outperforms a competing learning based baseline in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE), particularly at high Doppler frequencies and extended prediction horizons. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for channel prediction in rapidly time varying OTFS systems."}

Therefore, achieving highly adaptive resource management is of great significance in practical deployment applications. This paper first designs a regional resource management (RRM) mode and further formulates the RRM problem that can provide a unified decision space independent of the network scale. Subsequently, leveraging the RRM mode and deep reinforcement learning framework, we develop a topology feature-based dynamic and adaptive resource management algorithm to combat the varying network scales. The proposed algorithm successfully takes into account the fixed output dimension of the neural network and the changing resource chains for E2E service provisioning. The matched design of the service orientation information and phased reward function effectively improves the service performance of the algorithm under the RRM mode.

To characterize the uncertainty computing resources at different mining participants, we establish an ambiguous set representing uncertainty of resource distributions. Then, the networked mining is formulated as a non-cooperative game, where distributionally robust performance is calculated for each individual miner to tackle the resource uncertainties. We prove the existence of the equilibrium of the distributionally robust mining game.

Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans."}

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines. Interpretability analysis confirms that our multi-scale causal serialization effectively drives attention toward cliff-determining differences."}

We introduce a physics-informed, mean-only stochastic-geometry model of aggregate interference to altitude-binned received power, yielding three interpretable parameters for a given band and campaign: 1) line-of-sight transition slope, 2) transition altitude, and 3) effective activity constant. Analysis of aerial spectrum measurements collected from 2023 to 2025 across multiple sub-6 GHz bands reveals that downlink (DL) and shared-access bands preserve a persistent geometry-driven altitude structure that is stable across years. In contrast, uplink (UL) bands exhibit weak altitude dependence with no identifiable transition, indicating that interference is dominated by activity dynamics rather than propagation geometry. To quantify the practical limits of model reuse, we evaluate a minimal-calibration method in which the transition altitude is fixed from a reference year and the remaining parameters are estimated from only two altitude bins in the target year. The results further indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions for DL and CBRS bands, suggesting the feasibility of low-cost model transfer in stable environments, while highlighting the reduced applicability of mean-field models for UL scenarios."}

However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks."}

For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes.

Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired.

The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.

Additionally, the high data volume of medical content and the limited battery life of IoT devices pose further challenges. To address these challenges, data compression techniques such as Autoencoders (AEs) offer promising solutions by significantly reducing the communication overhead without sacrificing essential image quality or details. Additionally, spectrum allocation mechanisms in rural areas are often inefficient, leading to poor resource utilization. Auction theory presents a dynamic and adaptive approach to optimize spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that integrates AE-based data compression with auction-based spectrum allocation, addressing both communication efficiency and spectrum utilization in rural wireless networks.

In this work, we systematically analyze the interdependence among RSSI, throughput, transmission power (TXP), and the peripheral device system power consumption under diverse real-world conditions. We observe that adjusting the TXP effectively influences both RSSI and throughput. We propose a robust closed-loop TXP control framework based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. Two initial control strategies are investigated: an RSSI-based approach and a throughput-based approach, each exhibiting distinct advantages and limitations. The RSSI-based method provides rapid responsiveness to signal fluctuations but lacks direct correlation with data throughput, whereas the throughput-based method offers more accurate feedback on effective throughput at the cost of slower response. To address these limitations, a hybrid RSSI-throughput control strategy is developed, combining the responsiveness of RSSI feedback with the accuracy of throughput measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach maintains data throughput close to the target level with minimal variance, even under rapidly changing environmental conditions."}

Prior methods fail to maintain stealthiness, verification feasibility, or robustness when only one or a few sequences can be modified. To address these limitations, we introduce SLIM, a framework enabling per-user data provenance verification under strict black-box access. SLIM leverages intrinsic LLM properties to induce a Latent-Space Confusion Zone by training the model to map semantically similar prefixes to divergent continuations. This manifests as localized generation instability, which can be reliably detected via hypothesis testing.

Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices.

This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions. The proposed model is tested on conventional performance metrics, such as accuracy, accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and shows good detection and high levels of strength. The findings suggest that neural network-based solutions have the potential to be used effectively to identify the latent threat dynamics within the context of a large-scale social media network and that they can be employed to complement the existing intrusion detection system and better to conduct proactive cybersecurity operations."}

In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees."}

Among the various approaches, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols have been widely adopted for their structured and collision-free communication capabilities. Nevertheless, despite extensive research in this area, current solutions often exhibit suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic environments where node activity levels fluctuate over time.\n  This paper introduces a novel fully distributed TDMA-based scheduling protocol that intelligently maximizes the utilization of communication resources. The proposed approach adaptively reallocates underutilized time slots, originally assigned to temporarily inactive nodes, to those experiencing higher communication demands. This dynamic reallocation not only improves channel utilization but also reduces idle periods, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a lightweight probabilistic mechanism that governs the temporal leasing of unused slots. This mechanism balances the trade-off between slot availability and transmission reliability, minimizing packet loss while preserving fairness and stability within the network.\n  Simulations across a range of network scenarios demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves throughput, latency, and reliability in resource-constrained environments. These results highlight the protocol's potential as a robust and scalable solution for adaptive and energy-efficient scheduling in next-generation IoT networks."}

Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation.

However, the trustworthiness of such models is limited if generated trajectories are not physically plausible. For this reason we propose a physics-informed approach in which aircraft thrust and airspeed are learned from data and are used to condition the existing Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is physics-based and enforces energy-based constraints on generated trajectories. A set of informative features are identified and used to condition a probabilistic model of aircraft thrust and airspeed, with the proposed scheme demonstrating a 20% improvement in skilfulness across a set of six metrics, compared against a baseline probabilistic model that ignores contextual information such as meteorological conditions."}

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training."}

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF."}

In this paper, we propose oneTwin, the first online digital twin system, for the prediction of physical layer metrics.

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data."}

The core idea is to integrate interpretable surrogate models and safe optimization solvers to continually optimize control actions, while adapting to non-stationary dynamics in real-world networks. We achieve the inRAN framework with three key components: 1) an interpretable surrogate model via ensembling Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs); 2) safe optimization solvers via integrating genetic search and trust-region descent method; 3) an online dynamics tracker via continual model learning and adaptive threshold offset. We implement inRAN in an end-to-end O-RAN-compliant network testbed, and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments with the focused use case of network slicing.

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."}

In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising.

Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.\n  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts."}

The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach."}

Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly."}

We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery.

We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent. Analyses confirm the model moves beyond replicating existing motifs, synthesizing 455 high-performing architectures absent from the original corpus.

We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores."}

To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics."}

We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."}

While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning."}

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines."}

We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach."}

While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \\propto \\mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.\n  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.\n  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression."}

Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models."}

Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints."}

Under review at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning."}

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems."}

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering."}

While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability."}

Existing approaches rely on manually crafted transformation rules to preserve watermarked code functionality or manipulate token-generation probabilities at inference time, which are prone to compilation errors. To address these challenges, SWaRL employs a reinforcement learning-based co-training framework that uses compiler feedback for functional correctness and a jointly trained confidential verifier as a reward signal to maintain watermark detectability. Furthermore, SWaRL employs low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during fine-tuning, allowing the learned watermark information to be transferable across model updates. Extensive experiments show that SWaRL achieves higher watermark detection accuracy compared to prior methods while fully maintaining watermarked code functionality. The LoRA-based signature embedding steers the base model to generate and solve code in a watermark-specific manner without significant computational overhead. Moreover, SWaRL exhibits strong resilience against refactoring and adversarial transformation attacks."}

While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings."}
