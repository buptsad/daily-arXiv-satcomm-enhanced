In this paper, we propose a novel dual-hop wireless network, where the first hop consists of a hybrid free-space optics (FSO) / terahertz (THz) link, and the second hop incorporates an aerial RIS-based radio frequency (RF) link. To provide a comprehensive performance evaluation, a comparative analysis of two switching strategies is conducted: (1) hard switching and (2) soft switching. Novel closed-form expressions are derived for key performance metrics, including outage probability and bit error rate. These expressions are then utilized to investigate the impact of various system parameters. Our proposed hybrid model demonstrates a 52.54% performance improvement over the traditional RF-FSO framework. Moreover, the integration of an aerial RIS in the second hop enhances system performance by 41.39%. Numerical findings suggest that strategically placing the aerial RIS at a lower altitude and maintaining an equal, shorter distance from both communication endpoints significantly improves overall system performance. To analyze the response under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, asymptotic analysis is performed, and the diversity order of the system is determined. Finally, the analytical results are validated through a Monte Carlo simulation."}

Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.\n  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums."}

The MCTS decoder searches for test error patterns (TEPs) in the received information bits and obtains codeword candidates through re-encoding. The TEP search is executed on a tree structure, guided by a neural network policy trained via MCTS-based learning. The trained policy guides the decoder to find the correct TEPs with minimal steps from the root node (all-zero TEP). The decoder outputs the codeword with maximum likelihood when the early stopping criterion is satisfied. The proposed method requires no Gaussian elimination (GE) compared to ordered statistics decoding (OSD) and can reduce search complexity by 95\\% compared to non-GE OSD. It achieves lower decoding latency than both OSD and non-GE OSD at high SNRs."}

The study is motivated by a moving object tracking problem in a sensor network and can find applications in settings where the order of the symbols in a codeword cannot be maintained or observed. In this paper a multiset coding scheme is proposed on source data that can be organized as a flat or cyclic multi-dimensional integer lattice (grid). A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids. Moreover for a code of a given code set size and multiset cardinality, if we measure coding efficiency by the number of distinct symbols required, then braid codes have asymptotic order equal to those that are optimal. We also show that braid codes have interesting inherent error correction properties."}

The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs."}

Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training."}

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Five feature selection methods, Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test, Recursive Feature Elimination, Mean Absolute Deviation, and Dispersion Ratio, were combined to identify the most relevant features of GeNIS and reduce its dimensionality, enabling a more computationally efficient detection. Three decision tree ensembles and two deep neural networks were trained for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

It is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if any $k$ out of $k+r$ coordinates suffice to reconstruct the whole codeword. The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures. In this paper, given an arbitrary binary MDS array code with sub-packetization $m$ as the base code, we propose two generic approaches (Generic Construction I and II) for constructing binary MDS array codes with optimal access (or repair) bandwidth for single-node failures.

However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals."}

TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression).

Current cryptographic solutions introduce additional computational overhead, which results in heightened identification delays. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identifies devices at the physical layer, blocking impersonation attacks while significantly reducing latency. Unfortunately, multipath channels compromise RFF accuracy, and existing channel-resilient methods demand feedback or processing across multiple time points, incurring extra signaling latency. To address this problem, the paper introduces a new RFF extraction technique that employs signals from multiple receiving antennas to address multipath issues without adding latency. Unlike single-domain methods, the Log-Linear Delta Ratio (LLDR) of co-temporal channel frequency responses (CFRs) from multiple antennas is employed to preserve discriminative RFF features, eliminating multi-time sampling and reducing acquisition time. To overcome the challenge of the reliance on minimal channel variation, the frequency band is segmented into sub-bands, and the LLDR is computed within each sub-band individually. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme attains a 96.13% identification accuracy for 30 user equipments (UEs) within a 20-path channel under a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB. Furthermore, we evaluate the theoretical latency using the Roofline model, resulting in the air interface latency of 0.491 ms, which satisfies ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) latency requirements."}

However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner.

Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering. Finally, the approach is validated via a vehicle emission control problem, where it effectively improves the detection accuracy of excess-emission events."}

Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates.

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality.

The resulting concentrated distribution enables effective non-uniform quantization with reduced distortion.

Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."}

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

In the context of networked systems, controllability is a well-established concept. However, many real-world systems, from biological collectives to engineered infrastructures, exhibit higher-order interactions that cannot be captured by simple graphs. Moreover, the way in which agents interact and influence one another is often unknown and must be inferred from partial observations of the system. Here, we close the loop between a hypergraph representation and our recently developed hypergraph inference algorithm, THIS, to infer the underlying multibody couplings. Building on the inferred structure, we design a parsimonious controller that, given a minimal set of controllable nodes, steers the system toward a desired configuration. We validate the proposed system identification and control framework on a network of Kuramoto oscillators evolving over a hypergraph."}

While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy."}

We bridge hierarchical game-theoretic modeling with online feedback optimization by casting urban mobility as a tri-level Stackelberg game (travelers, operators, municipality) closed in a feedback loop. The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses). This model-free pipeline enforces constraints, accommodates heterogeneous users and modes, and scales to higher-dimensional policy vectors without differentiating through equilibrium maps.\n  On a real multimodal network for Zurich, Switzerland, our method attains substantially better municipal objectives than Bayesian optimization and Genetic algorithms, and identifies integration incentives that increase multimodal usage while improving both operator objectives. The results show that feedback-based regulation can steer competition toward cooperative outcomes and deliver tangible welfare gains in complex, data-rich mobility ecosystems."}

A key challenge is to ensure ultra-reliable and low-latency transmission of haptic packets under channel variations and potential network outages. To address these issues, one approach relies on local estimation of haptic feedback at the operator side. However, designing an accurate estimator that can faithfully reproduce the true haptic forces remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, xHAP, based on cross-modal attention to estimate haptic feedback. xHAP fuses information from two distinct data streams: the teleoperator's historical force feedback and the operator's control action sequence. We employ modality-specific encoders to learn temporal representations, followed by a cross-attention layer where the teleoperator haptic data attend to the operator input. This fusion allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant operator sensory data when predicting the teleoperator's haptic feedback. The proposed architecture reduces the mean-squared error by more than two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods and lowers the SNR requirement for reliable transmission by $10~\\mathrm{dB}$ at an error threshold of $0.1$ in a 3GPP UMa scenario. Additionally, it increases coverage by $138\\%$ and supports $59.6\\%$ more haptic users even under 10 dB lower SNR compared to the baseline."}

However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAE outperforms baselines by an average of 31.28% when updated with a 9-fold increase in the number of classes."}

By invoking the Szegö limit theorem, these matrices are shown to be approximately diagonalizable by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Based on this structure, the LMMSE channel estimation error is reformulated into a compact analytical form, from which a closed-form lower bound is derived. Furthermore, we establish the condition under which this bound is achieved by a lattice-based pilot pattern. Numerical results verify that the proposed matrix approximation introduces negligible error and examples of the proposed lattice design are given."}

This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators.

To address this issue, we propose Mip-NeWRF, a physics-informed neural framework for accurate indoor channel prediction based on sparse channel measurements. The framework operates in a ray-based pipeline with coarse-to-fine importance sampling: frustum samples are encoded, processed by a shared multilayer perceptron (MLP), and the outputs are synthesized into the channel frequency response (CFR). Prior to MLP input, Mip-NeWRF performs conical-frustum sampling and applies a scale-consistent hybrid positional encoding to each frustum. The scale-consistent normalization aligns positional encodings across scene scales, while the hybrid encoding supplies both scale-robust, low-frequency stability to accelerate convergence and fine spatial detail to improve accuracy. During training, a curriculum learning schedule is applied to stabilize and accelerate convergence of the shared MLP. During channel synthesis, the MLP outputs, including predicted virtual transmitter presence probabilities and amplitudes, are combined with modeled pathloss and surface interaction attenuation to enhance physical fidelity and further improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: in typical scenarios, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) is reduced by 14.3 dB versus state-of-the-art baselines."}

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization."}

Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection.

Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce \"BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems\", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight. Collectively, our work will help decode active sensing strategies and inform the design of estimation algorithms in sensorimotor systems."}

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations."}

To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness. Experiments show that FTDBA achieves a 92.3\\% attack success rate with only 62.4\\% of the poisoning volume required by traditional DBA methods, while reducing the detection rate by 22.8\\% and KL divergence by 41.2\\%.

To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms.

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency.

However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances."}

However, MHR design entails a comprehensive evaluation of multiple possible configurations and demands extremely time-consuming simulation of key parameters combination. To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius. By checking fabricating feasibility of anchor radius and allowing rapid modal characteristics evaluation without interference, ablation and comparative experiments validated the method's superiority, as an effective support of MHR design. Design optimization experiments demonstrate a prediction accuracy of 96.35%, with computational time reduced to 1/48,000 of traditional finite element methods, significantly improving design efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants."}

There are mainly two classes of KLE techniques, cascade encryption and XOR-cascade encryption. This paper presents several quantum meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against two specific KLE constructions.\n  For the two-key triple encryption (2kTE), we propose two quantum MITM attacks under the Q2 model. The first attack, leveraging the quantum claw-finding (QCF) algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{2κ/3})$ with $O(2^{2κ/3})$ quantum random access memory (QRAM). The second attack, based on Grover's algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{κ/2})$ with $O(2^κ)$ QRAM. The latter complexity is nearly identical to Grover-based brute-force attack on the underlying block cipher, indicating that 2kTE does not enhance security under the Q2 model when sufficient QRAM resources are available.\n  For the 3XOR-cascade encryption (3XCE), we propose a quantum MITM attack applicable to the Q1 model. This attack requires no QRAM and has a time complexity of $O(2^{(κ+n)/2})$ ($κ$ and $n$ are the key length and block length of the underlying block cipher, respectively.), achieving a quadratic speedup over classical MITM attack.\n  Furthermore, we extend the quantum MITM attack to quantum sieve-in-the-middle (SITM) attack, which is applicable for more constructions. We present a general quantum SITM framework for the construction $ELE=E^2\\circ L\\circ E^1$ and provide specific attack schemes for three different forms of the middle layer $L$.

Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function.

The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments.

Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."}

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Focusing on a bistatic sensing setup, we leverage a Neumann-series approximation of the array response model and derive the Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target parameter estimation, which is then incorporated into a sensing optimization formulation with respect to the metasurface's per-element resonance strength configuration. Simulation results on the position error bound in the radiative near field with the proposed design quantify the critical role of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems."}

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches.

However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants."}

The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression.

When a sensor node depletes its energy reserves, manual intervention is often required to resume node operation. While lowering the duty cycle would help extend the network lifetime, this is often undesirable, especially in time-critical applications, where rapid collection and dissemination of information is vital. In this paper, we propose a context-aware energy management policy that helps balance the two opposing objectives of timely data collection and dissemination with energy conservation. We capture these objectives through the Value of Information (VoI) of observations made by a sensor node and the State of Energy (SoE) of the energy buffer. We formulate the energy management policy as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem which computes device sampling and transmission frequencies to maximize a defined utility criterion over a finite, receding, time-horizon. In the process, we also develop a unique mathematical representation for VoI, that adequately captures aspects related to continuity in monitoring, urgency of dissemination, and representation of the phenomena being observed. In the end, we use data collected from a real-world flash flood event, to evaluate our decision framework across multiple scenarios of energy availability."}

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods."}

However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training). As the first work to pioneer video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training, available training resources are expanded by bridging computer vision and distributed sensing areas. The enhanced performance and generalization facilitate DAS deployment across diverse industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing."}

Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy.

Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors.

To be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency."}

In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages.

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models."}

Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture.

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations."}

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty."}

However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals."}

These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods."}

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption."}

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100."}

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning."}

To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method."}

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization."}

We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks."}

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency."}

To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets."}

Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism.

We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses."}

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters.

To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer."}

In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices.

Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation.

To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD."}

More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools."}

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models", "comment": "6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words", "summary": "With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction."}

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction."}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning."}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs."}

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency."}

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth."}

Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines."}

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms."}

Specifically, we introduce a robust watermarking framework, DeepTracer, which leverages a novel watermark samples construction method and a same-class coupling loss constraint. DeepTracer can incur a high-coupling model between watermark task and primary task that makes adversaries inevitably learn the hidden watermark task when stealing the primary task functionality.

However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy."}
