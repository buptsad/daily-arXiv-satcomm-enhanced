A novel methodology is introduced that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the energy infrastructure together with an operating strategy optimization to reduce the electricity costs while enhancing grid interaction. While the focus lies on the methodology, the financial opportunities for the use-case of an electric NRMM rental service will be presented.

To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7535\u538b\u4e0e\u7535\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\uff08HCM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u6d41\u5fae\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684 DER\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u538b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7535\u6d41\u8c10\u6ce2\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8026\u5408\u6291\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u7535\u6d41\u73af\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u76f4\u6d41\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u8c10\u6ce2\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7ecf\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65e0\u4e0d\u826f\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u73af\uff08HIL\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u57df\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8fde\u63a5\u76f4\u6d41\u5fae\u7f51\u7684\u5355\u76f8\u4ea4\u6d41\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u77ac\u65f6\u529f\u7387\u7684\u632f\u8361\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u76f4\u6d41\u4fa7\u8c10\u6ce2\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u635f\u8017\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u76f4\u6d41\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7535\u538b\u8c10\u6ce2\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u5355\u76f8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7535\u538b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5185\u90e8\u7535\u6d41\u73af\u8d1f\u8d23\u5feb\u901f\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u7ed9\u5185\u90e8\u73af\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u5916\u63a7\u5c42\u5c06\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u538b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u8c10\u6ce2\u7535\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u540c\u4e00 DER \u7684\u76f4\u6d41\u8f93\u51fa\u7aef\u5bf9\u76f4\u6d41\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u8c10\u6ce2\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u8026\u5408\u8c03\u8282\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u538b\u73af\u4e0e\u8c10\u6ce2\u7535\u6d41\u73af\u89e3\u8026\u3001\u65e0\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u73af\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u57df\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u538b\u73af\u4e0e\u8c10\u6ce2\u7535\u6d41\u73af\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u8026\u5408\u3002HIL \u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u57df\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u538b\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 HCM \u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u538b\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u8c10\u6ce2\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u6d41\u5fae\u7f51\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u76f4\u6d41\u7a33\u6001\u4e0e\u5355\u76f8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u7535\u538b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While AIoT offers a promising path, covering vast, inaccessible regions necessitates the massive deployment of maintenance-free, battery-less nodes with limited computational resources. However, these constraints create a critical `Availability Gap.' Conventional intermittent operations prioritize computation throughput, forcing sensors to sleep during energy buffering. Consequently, systems miss ephemeral, `now-or-never' events (e.g., Vocalizations of natural monuments or Fire), which is fatal for detecting rare but high-stakes anomalies. To address this, we propose an Energy-aware Elastic Split Computing Algorithm that prioritizes continuous sensing by dynamically offloading tasks to energy-rich neighbors. Preliminary results demonstrate stable monitoring of an additional $2,496\\;\\text{m}^2$ and the capture of approximately 103 more critical events per day.

The proposed approach expresses security, governance, and performance objectives as high-level declarative intents, which are systematically translated into enforceable gateway configurations and continuously validated through policy verification and telemetry-driven feedback. By decoupling intent specification from enforcement while enabling bounded, policy-compliant adaptation, the architecture supports heterogeneous gateway implementations without compromising governance guarantees or service-level objectives. A prototype implementation across multiple Kubernetes clusters demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design. Experimental results show up to a 42% reduction in policy drift, a 31% improvement in configuration propagation time, and sustained p95 latency overhead below 6% under variable workloads, compared to manual and declarative baseline approaches. These results indicate that governance-aware, intent-driven gateway orchestration provides a scalable and reliable foundation for secure, consistent, and performance-predictable cloud-native platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to capture long-range dependencies in the frequency domain. To ensure scalability and robustness, the proposed framework integrates transfer learning based on a conjugate prior mechanism and a low-rank decomposition (LRD) technique, thus enabling efficient support for large-scale user deployments and aerial layers. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline schemes including WMMSE, ZF, MRT, CNN-based DRL, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in terms of average sum rate, robustness to CSI imperfection, user mobility, and scalability across varying network sizes and user densities. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method achieves significant computational efficiency compared to CNN-based and WMMSE methods, while reducing communication overhead in comparison with shared-critic DRL approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting. These findings indicate that jointly exploiting smoothness and nonnegativity in a Chebyshev domain provides an effective tool for covariance-domain processing in multi-antenna systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects.

Since delivery drones are expensive and may carry valuable packages, they must maintain a safe distance from individuals until user-drone mutual authentication is confirmed. Despite numerous authentication schemes being developed, existing solutions are limited in authentication distance and lack resilience against sophisticated attacks. To this end, we introduce SyncGait, an implicit gait-based mutual authentication system for drone delivery. SyncGait leverages the user's unique arm swing as he walks toward the drone to achieve mutual authentication without requiring additional hardware or specific authentication actions. We conducted extensive experiments on 14 datasets collected from 31 subjects.

In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8865\u4e01Transformer\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u6b65\u6b21\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u4f4d\u79fbNOWCAST\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9EGMS\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u533a\u57df\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5730\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u7f13\u89e3\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u5730\u9707\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\u53e0\u52a0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u89c2\u6d4b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8865\u4e01\u5f0fTransformer\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u4f4d\u79fbnowcasting\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a64x64\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u8986\u76d6100kmx100km\u533a\u57df\u7684EGMS\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6444\u53d6\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca(i) \u9759\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u5e45\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u5185\u4ee5\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c(ii) \u65e5\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u4e1c\u90e8\u7684 tile E32N34\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684CNN-LSTM\u3001CNN-LSTM+Attn\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001STGCN\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ecRMSE\u548cR^2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e1c\u90e8\u7231\u5c14\u5170 tile E32N34 \u4e0a\uff0c\u53d7\u63a7\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0 RMSE = 0.90 mm\u3001R^2 = 0.97\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9608\u503c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4e0e\u4ec5\u5728\u4f4d\u79fb\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\u7684STGCN\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f18\u52bf\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5730\u9762\u53d8\u5f62\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6216\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u8868\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u673a\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 AMP-type \u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0 replica MAP BER \u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa CD-MAMP \u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5177\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u7684OFDM/OTFS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u8303\u6570\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u5149\u8c31\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u8870\u843d\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u8f93\u5165\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u6362\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u7b49\u6548\u8f93\u5165\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u7684\u901a\u9053\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 replica MAP BER \u80fd\u591f\u88ab AMP \u578b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u8bb0\u5fc6\u578b AMP\uff08CD-MAMP\uff09\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u53ca\u7b49\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316 replica MAP BER\u3001\u6700\u5927\u5316 replica \u9650\u5236\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba CD-MAMP \u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u539f\u7406\u4e0e replica \u9650\u5236\u5bb9\u91cf\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u8303\u6570\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u5149\u8c31\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cAMP \u578b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230 replica MAP BER \u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa CD-MAMP \u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u5bf9\u65f6\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4f7f BER \u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u5bb9\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa CD-MAMP \u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u5bb9\u91cf\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5bf9\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 CD-MAMP \u7b49\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

It has proven to be a monumental and revolutionary tool that keeps the world connected. However, recent WiFi advancements are numerous and at times confusing. WiFi has grown significantly over the years, yet few understand the scope and scale of WiFi progression as a whole. This paper tackles that problem, providing a broad literature review on the advancements of key WiFi features to date. This paper will center on seven key areas of focus: (1) bandwidth, (2) battery life, (3) traffic collisions, (4) interference, (5) data-intensive transmissions, (6) numerous devices, and (7) peak throughput/modulation. Each section will focus on WiFi's problems, how those problems were fixed, as well as the limitations of existing solutions. Moreover, the paper explains the role of new unreleased technologies in these seven areas. This includes exploring the upcoming WiFi 8 standard based on the IEEE 802.11bn \"Ultra High Reliability\" (UHR) specification and how it builds upon current specifications. Compared to previous specifications, WiFi 8 marks a stronger and more significant shift toward prioritizing reliability over pure data rates. Beyond a sole literature review, this paper uses a novel analogy. A road/highway analogy will be integrated throughout the paper to facilitate understanding of networking mechanisms. This paper is approachable and is written such that someone with very little WiFi knowledge should come away with a strong understanding of WiFi.

Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\\mathbf\u03b8$ given observed data $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion-based simulation-based inference (SBI) \u80fd\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6837\u672c\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed9\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u4e0e\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u6d41\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u540e\u9a8c/\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u805a\u7126\u6269\u6563SBI\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u9519\u914d\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316/\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u68b3\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6307\u51fa\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5728\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4eff\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u65f6\u95f4SDE/ODE\u3001\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u8ba8\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u6d41\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c/\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u4e0e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u7b49 Trade-offs\u3002\u6c47\u96c6Schr\u00f6dinger\u6865\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6761\u4ef6/\u5e8f\u8d2f\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3001\u5bf9\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u644a\u9500\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u5148\u9a8c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6c47\u603b\u4e86\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u4e0e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff1b\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6269\u6563SBI\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u9700\u8981\u9010\u6b65/\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5c1a\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u672a\u6765\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u542b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6269\u6563SBI\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786e\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u540e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u9519\u914d\u3001\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u9650/\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen), which searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF), the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. Our evolutionary attacker achieves mean OGF = 1.38 +/- 1.15 and Success@OGF >= 2 of 24.5 percent on Phi-3. RL-GOAL is stronger: across victims it achieves higher mean OGF (up to 2.81 +/- 1.38).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684 DoS \u98ce\u683c\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u8005\uff08EOGen \u548c RL-GOAL\uff09\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 Over-Generation Factor\uff08OGF\uff09\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e RL-GOAL \u76f8\u5bf9 EOGen \u66f4\u5177\u653b\u51fb\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u7eed\u5199\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs \u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u957f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e DoS \u653b\u51fb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3001\u53ea\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u53ea\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u5df2\u77e5\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\uff1aEOGen\uff08\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u524d\u7f00\u4ee5\u6291\u5236 EOS\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u957f\u7eed\u5199\uff09\u548c RL-GOAL\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u524d\u7f00\u751f\u6210\uff09\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49 Over-Generation Factor\uff08OGF\uff09\u53ca\u5bf9 stall/\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9 Phi-3 \u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "EOGen \u7684\u5e73\u5747 OGF \u4e3a 1.38 \u00b1 1.15\uff0cSuccess@OGF\u22652 \u4e3a 24.5%\u3002RL-GOAL \u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747 OGF \u53ef\u8fbe 2.81 \u00b1 1.38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u6297\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1bRL-GOAL \u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u653b\u51fb\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u9632\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this letter, we investigate the MA-enhanced wide beam coverage over multiple subregions in the spatial domain. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired subregions by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna position vector (APV). Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional fixed position antennas (FPAs) and achieve a comparable performance to the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with dramatically lower complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\uff1a\u5c06\u53d1\u5c04\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e0e\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u675f\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a notch \u6ee4\u6ce2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u5e45\u76f8\u7684 MNF-\u578b\u6ce2\u675f\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u9010\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408 Gibbs \u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1 AO \u4f46\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u51f8\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3d\u91cf\u5747\u8861\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4 MNF \u7684\u89c2\u5ff5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6ce2\u675f\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5929\u7ebf\u79fb\u52a8\u533a\u57df\u5185\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u7a7a\u95f4 MNF-\u578b\u53d1\u5c04\u6ce2\u675f\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9010\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18 MA \u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408 Gibbs \u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5929\u7ebf\uff08FPA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0e\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff08AO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5 MNF-\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 MA \u8054\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u6ce2\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u4f18\u826f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Traditional copper and optical wiring face fundamental challenges in latency, power consumption, and rigidity, constraining the scalability of distributed AI clusters. This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions. The article concludes with a roadmap toward wireless-defined, reconfigurable, and sustainable AI data centers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5185\u4f7f\u7528 Terahertz \u65e0\u7ebf\u94fe\u8def\uff08THz-WDC\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3 AI \u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u8986\u76d61-100\u7c73\u77ed\u4e2d\u8ddd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u94fe\u8def1 Tbps\u3001\u805a\u540810 Tbps\uff0c\u4e9a50 ns \u5355\u8df3\u65f6\u5ef6\uff0c20\u7c73\u65f6<10 pJ/bit\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "AI \u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6025\u5267\u589e\u957f\u5e26\u6765\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e92\u8fde\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u94dc\u7f06\u4e0e\u5149\u7ea4\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u529f\u8017\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u521a\u6027\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\u5236\u7ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa THz-WDC \u613f\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u6027\u80fd/\u6280\u672f\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5b9e\u73b0\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7f16\u6392\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u64cd\u63a7\u3001\u5168\u7845 THz \u6536\u53d1\u4e0e\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u5e26\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff08\u91cf\u5b50/\u82af\u7247\u62fc\u5757\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u7684 interconnect \u573a\u666f\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u8ddd\u79bb-\u541e\u5410\u95e8\u69db\u4e0a THz \u94fe\u8def\u4f18\u4e8e\u6709\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u57df\uff1b\u5c1a\u5904\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1/\u5206\u6790\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u539f\u578b\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u65e0\u7ebf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684 AI \u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8def\u6807\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03 THz \u65e0\u7ebf\u4e92\u8fde\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4e2d\u5230\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e92\u8fde\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern \"Red AI\" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural \"important features\" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.\n  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute.

As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N>10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9879\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1) \u5bf9N>10\u7684RMRA\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f311\u201314\u7684\u5168\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e0e15\u201320\u7684\u8fd1/\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u91cf\u8fd1/\u6b21\u4f18RMRA\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0TFRSA\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff08CFEs\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u5b54\u5f84\u548cDOF\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1CFEs\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u6613\u53d7\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5931\u6548\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u5177\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982TFRSA\u4e0eRMRA\uff09\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5dee\u5206\u9635\u5217\u7684\u5b54\u6d1e\u81ea\u7531\u6027\u548cDOFs\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9RMRA\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u4ec5\u5728N=6\u201310\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4fN>10\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53ef\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8fd1/\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a77\u4e3e\u7684MATLAB\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u641c\u7d22RMRA\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97N=11\u201314\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0cN=15\u201320\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1/\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5927\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u4ee3\u6570\u6cdb\u5316\u4ece\u7a77\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6TFRSA\u7684CFEs\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5b54\u5f84\u548cDOF\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MATLAB\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fddCFEs\u5bf9N\u22658\u6709\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u627e\u5230N=11\u201314\u7684\u6700\u4f18RMRA\uff1bN=15\u201320\u5f97\u5230\u8fd1/\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TFRSA\u65b0\u65cf\u5177\u6709CFEs\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5b54\u5f84\u548cDOF\uff0c\u4e14\u7ecfMATLAB\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9N\u22658\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18RMRA\u7684\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b26\u5408CFEs\u7684\u8fd1/\u6b21\u4f18RMRA\u65cf\uff0c\u4e14\u65b0TFRSA\u7684CFEs\u53ef\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

To date, most known MDS codes are generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes, leaving codes that are not equivalent to GRS codes comparatively less understood. Studying this non-GRS regime is therefore of intrinsic theoretical interest, and is also practically relevant since the strong algebraic structure of GRS codes can be undesirable in cryptographic settings. Among the known non-GRS codes, twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes and Roth-Lempel codes are two representative families of non-GRS codes that have attracted significant attention. Though substantial work has been devoted to the construction and structural analysis of TGRS and Roth-Lempel codes, comparatively little attention has been paid to their decoding, and many problems remain open. In this paper, we propose list and unique decoding algorithms for TGRS codes and Roth-Lempel codes based on the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm. Under suitable parameter conditions, our algorithms achieve near-linear running time in the code length, improving upon the previously best-known quadratic-time complexity. Our TGRS decoder supports fixed-rate TGRS codes with up to O(n^2) twists, substantially extending prior work that only handled the single-twist case. For Roth-Lempel codes, we provide what appears to be the first efficient decoder. Moreover, our list decoders surpass the classical unique-decoding radius for a broad range of parameters. Finally, we incorporate algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes into the list-decoding framework, enabling recovery of the correct message from the output list with high probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u975eGRS\u5355\u5143MDS\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u626d\u8f6c\u5e7f\u4e49\u91cc\u5fb7-\u7d22\u9c81\uff08TGRS\uff09\u7801\u4e0e Roth-Lempel \u7801\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e Guruswami\u2013 Sudan \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u4e0e\u552f\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86 TGRS \u7684\u626d\u8f6c\u6570\u81f3 O(n^2)\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa Roth-Lempel \u7684\u9996\u6b21\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u534a\u5f84\u3002\u7ed3\u5408 AMD \u7801\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4ece\u89e3\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u975eGRS MDS \u7801\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6bd4 GR S \u7801\u66f4\u5c11\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14 GR S \u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5229\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76 TGRS \u548c Roth-Lempel \u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6297\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e Guruswami\u2013Sudan \u6cdb\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e TGRS \u7801\u4e0e Roth-Lempel \u7801\u7684\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9 TGRS \u626d\u8f6c\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u8fbe O(n^2)\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa Roth-Lempel \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5728\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165 AMD \u7801\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u786e\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\uff08\u4e0e\u7801\u957f\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8f83\u4f4e\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1bTGRS \u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u901f\u7387\u7684\u591a\u626d\u8f6c\u60c5\u5f62\uff08\u76f4\u81f3 O(n^2) \u626d\u8f6c\uff09\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff1bRoth-Lempel \u7801\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u534a\u5f84\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408 AMD \u7801\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u975eGRS MDS \u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u626d\u8f6c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4ea6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06 AMD \u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Dalal", "Vishal Misra"], "title": "Geometric Scaling of Bayesian Inference in LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled \"wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.\n  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u98ce\u6d1e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e95\u5c42\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8be5\u8f74\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5c06\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u6536\u7f29\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b\u5bf9\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u7684\u9776\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u6270\u4e71\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u98ce\u6d1e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e95\u5c42\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728Pythia\u3001Phi-2\u3001Llama-3\u3001Mistral\u7b49\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u503c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e3b\u8f74\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u662f\u5426\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\uff1b\u5728Pythia-410M\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u8fdb\u884c\u9776\u5411\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u79fb\u9664/\u6270\u52a8\u8be5\u8f74\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u8f74\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8f74\uff0c\u8be5\u8f74\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u88ab\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff1b\u5bf9\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4e4b\u7b49\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5bf9\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8870\u9000\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8f74\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u66f4\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4f7f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u98ce\u6d1e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e95\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u8be5\u5e95\u5c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5b50\u5c42\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u6cbf\u8be5\u8f74\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u662f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7279\u6743\u6027\u8bfb\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

We show that multipliers guarantee the closed-loop power gain to be bounded and quantifiable. Power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee such Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous signals have constant steady state. For periodic excitation, the closed-loop response can apparently have a subharmonic or chaotic response. We revisit a class of multipliers that can guarantee a unique, attractive and period-preserving solution. We show the multipliers can be derived using classical tools and reconsider assumptions required for their application. Their phase limitations are inherited from those of discrete-time multipliers. The multipliers cannot be used at all frequencies unless the circle criterion can also be applied; this is consistent with known results about dynamic multipliers and incremental stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u52a8\u6001\u4e58\u5b50\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5e26\u659c\u7387\u9650\u5236\u7684Lurie\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u754c\u5b9a\u95ed\u73af\u529f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u5bf9\u5468\u671f\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u6216\u6df7\u6c8c\u3002\u4e58\u5b50\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5076\u4e2a\u6027\uff08\u5947\u6027\uff09\u6709\u6240\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u76f8\u4f4d\u9650\u5236\u6765\u81ea\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u4e58\u5b50\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5706\u5224\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u659c\u7387\u9650\u5236\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684Lurie\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u95ed\u73af\u529f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u7a33\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u504f\u7f6e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5f25\u8865\u4ec5\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u4e58\u5b50\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f46\u65e0\u589e\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u754c\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9\u975e\u5947\u6027\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e00\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u4e58\u5b50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e58\u5b50\u3001\u5206\u6790\u5176\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u9002\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u9879\u5468\u56f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u975e\u5947\u6027\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5706\u5224\u636e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u52a8\u6001\u4e58\u5b50\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u95ed\u73af\u529f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\uff1b\u82e5\u5bf9\u5176\u5b83\u5916\u6fc0\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u4e58\u5b50\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4f4e\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9\u5468\u671f\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u6b21\u8c10\u6ce2\u6216\u6df7\u6c8c\uff1b\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e58\u5b50\u65cf\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u552f\u4e00\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u5468\u671f\u7684\u89e3\uff1b\u76f8\u4f4d\u9650\u5236\u6765\u81ea\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u4e58\u5b50\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff1b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5706\u5224\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u4e58\u5b50\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u659c\u7387\u9650\u5236\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684Lurie\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u5f97\u5230\u529f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u754c\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d/\u9002\u7528\u6027\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u5bf9\u589e\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5706\u5224\u636e\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u504f\u7f6e\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u5947\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Under different variable-node edge-spreading rules, the random Tanner graphs of several coupled ensembles are defined by multiple independent, uniformly random monomial maps. The two main coupled ensembles considered are referred to as the standard coupled ensemble and the improved coupled ensemble. We prove that both coupled ensembles exhibit asymptotically good minimum distance and minimum stopping set size. Theoretical and numerical results show that the improved coupled ensemble can achieve better distance performance than the standard coupled ensemble. We introduce the essential preliminaries and analytical tools needed to analyze the iterative decoding threshold of coupled ensembles over any finite field. We consider a class of memoryless channels with special symmetry, termed q-ary input memoryless symmetric channels (QMSCs), and show that, for these channels, the distribution of channel messages (in form of probability vectors) likewise exhibits this symmetry. Consequently, we define symmetric probability measures and their reference measures on a finite-dimensional probability simplex, analyze their foundational properties and those of their linear functionals, endow their respective spaces with metric topologies, and conduct an in-depth study of their degradation theory. Based on our analytical framework, we establish a universal threshold saturation result for both of the coupled ensembles over a q-ary finite field on QMSCs. Specifically, as the coupling parameters increase, the belief-propagation threshold of a coupled system saturates to a well-defined threshold that depends only on the underlying ensemble and the channel family.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0a\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u5e8f\u8026\u5408LDPC\u7801\u65cf\uff08SC-LDPC\uff09\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8026\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bb5\u4e0a\u8026\u5408LDPC\u7801\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u505c\u6b62\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u7801\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u8fb9\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5219\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728QMSCs\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9608\u503c\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u7ec4\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u3001\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u7684\u5355\u9879\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u6784\u9020\u968f\u673a Tanner \u56fe\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u7c7b Ensemble\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u6982\u7387\u7b80\u5355\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u964d\u89e3\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u62d3\u6251\u53ca\u7ebf\u6027\u6cdb\u51fd\uff1b\u5728QMSCs\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u5927\u65f6\uff0cBP \u9608\u503c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u65cf\u7684\u666e\u9002\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u7c7b\u8026\u5408\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5747\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u505c\u6b62\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u8026\u5408\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u8026\u5408\u96c6\u5408\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u9002\u7684\u9608\u503c\u9971\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5373\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684BP\u9608\u503c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u96c6\u5408\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u65cf\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bb5SC-LDPC\u7801\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u9608\u503c\u548c\u964d\u89e3\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728QMSCs\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u9608\u503c\u9971\u548c\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8026\u5408LDPC\u7801\u65cf\u3002"}}

The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

We present Economic Denial Security (EDS), a detection-independent framework that makes attacks economically infeasible by exploiting a fundamental asymmetry: defenders control their environment while attackers cannot. EDS composes four mechanisms adaptive computational puzzles, decoy-driven interaction entropy, temporal stretching, and bandwidth taxation achieving provably superlinear cost amplification. We formalize EDS as a Stackelberg game, deriving closed-form equilibria for optimal parameter selection (Theorem 1) and proving that mechanism composition yields 2.1x greater costs than the sum of individual mechanisms (Theorem 2). EDS requires < 12KB memory, enabling deployment on ESP32 class microcontrollers. Evaluation on a 20-device heterogeneous IoT testbed across four attack scenarios (n = 30 trials, p < 0.001) demonstrates: 32-560x attack slowdown, 85-520:1 cost asymmetry, 8-62% attack success reduction, < 20ms latency overhead, and close to 0% false positives. Validation against IoT-23 malware (Mirai, Torii, Hajime) shows 88% standalone mitigation; combined with ML-IDS, EDS achieves 94% mitigation versus 67% for IDS alone a 27% improvement. EDS provides detection-independent protection suitable for resource-constrained environments where traditional approaches fail. The ability to detect and mitigate the malware samples tested was enhanced; however, the benefits provided by EDS were realized even without the inclusion of an IDS. Overall, the implementation of EDS serves to shift the economic balance in favor of the defender and provides a viable method to protect IoT and edge systems methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "EDS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u9898\u3001\u8bf1\u9975\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u62c9\u4f38\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u5f81\u7a0e\u56db\u5927\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u653e\u5927\u5e76\u5f31\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684 IoT/\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5 Stackelberg \u535a\u5f08\u5f62\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff08\u5b9a\u74061\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7ec4\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6210\u672c\u653e\u5927\u5927\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53e0\u52a0\uff08\u5b9a\u74062\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0<12KB \u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u5728 ESP32 \u7ea7\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u8986\u76d6 20 \u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5f02\u6784 IoT \u6d4b\u8bd5\u53f0\u548c IoT-23 \u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u51cf\u7f13\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e ML-IDS \u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728 IoT/\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5177\u5907\u52a0\u5bc6\u3001\u6f5c\u884c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u901f\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e ML \u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u843d\u5730\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u72ec\u7acb\u3001\u4ee5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u538b\u5236\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6808\u5f0f\u535a\u5f08\uff08Stackelberg game\uff09\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u5747\u8861\uff08\u5b9a\u74061\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6210\u672c\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u4e3a2.1x\uff08\u5b9a\u74062\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9 ESP32 \u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08<12KB \u5185\u5b58\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a 20 \u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7684 IoT \u6d4b\u8bd5\u53f0\u53ca IoT-23 \u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u72ec\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e ML-IDS \u7684\u8054\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "4 \u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d 32-560 \u500d\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027 85-520:1\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d 8-62%\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500 <20ms\u3001\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1 0%\u3002\u5728 IoT-23 \u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 88% \u72ec\u7acb\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u4e0e ML-IDS \u8054\u5408\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230 94% \u7f13\u89e3\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528 IDS \u7684 67% \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 27%\u3002", "conclusion": "EDS \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u522b\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fa6\u6d4b\u4f18\u5148\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u6291\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u6210\u672c\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u6218\u6597\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56 IDS\uff0cEDS \u4e5f\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4e0e IDS \u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6210\u4e3a IoT/\u8fb9\u7f18\u7cfb\u7edf\u9632\u62a4\u8865\u5145\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task.

Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees.

Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. However, since the available spectrum is non-contiguous and its occupancy changes with time, the spectral shaping solution has to be dynamically adapted. This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To accommodate the growing number of experts in practice, modern inference systems commonly adopt expert parallelism to distribute experts across devices. However, the absence of explicit load balancing constraints during inference allows adversarial inputs to trigger severe routing concentration. We demonstrate that out-of-distribution prompts can manipulate the routing strategy such that all tokens are consistently routed to the same set of top-$k$ experts, which creates computational bottlenecks on certain devices while forcing others to idle. This converts an efficiency mechanism into a denial-of-service attack vector, leading to violations of service-level agreements for time to first token. We propose RepetitionCurse, a low-cost black-box strategy to exploit this vulnerability. By identifying a universal flaw in MoE router behavior, RepetitionCurse constructs adversarial prompts using simple repetitive token patterns in a model-agnostic manner.

Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines.

Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem. Specifically, we reformulate the MOOP as a Stackelberg game, where MEC servers collectively act as the leader to determine the system-level decisions, while the vehicles act as followers to make individual decisions. At the follower level, we present a many-to-one matching mechanism to generate feasible discrete decisions. At the leader level, we propose a generative diffusion model-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) algorithm integrated with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method, which is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to determine the continuous decisions.

Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping\uff08TF-NRH\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6c7d\u8f66FMCW\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65f6\u9891\u535a\u5f08\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e72\u6270\u89c4\u907f\u3002\u96f7\u8fbe\u5728\u9891\u6bb5\u5b50\u5e26\u4e0e chirp \u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u534f\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u9891\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6291\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ca\u65f6-\u9891\u5206\u8fa8\u635f\u5931\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684 No-Regret \u8df3\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u9891\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8de8\u8d8a\u65f6\u57df\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u89c4\u907f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e72\u6270\u89c4\u907f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u53cd\u534f\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u9891\u6bb5\u5b50\u5e26\u548c chirp \u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u63d0\u51fa Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping \u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6362\u9057\u61be\u8d8b\u4e8e0\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u535a\u5f08\u6536\u655b\u81f3 \u03b5-\u7c97\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u6216\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u3002\u7ed9\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u57df\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9891\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5f02\u6b65\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ed9\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u96f7\u8fbe\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76f8\u8f83\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u968f\u673a\u8df3\u53d8\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d Nash \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 SINR\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u4e0e\u65f6-\u9891\u5206\u8fa8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u89c4\u907f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u9891\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u96f7\u8fbe\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f02\u6784\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience.

It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth.

Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse.

The central mechanism is energy-grade matching: low-grade WtE thermal output drives absorption cooling to deliver chilled service, thereby displacing baseline cooling electricity. We show that thermoeconomic superiority is governed by three first-order determinants, (i) cooling coverage of IT heat load, (ii) parasitic electricity for transport and auxiliaries, and (iii) distance-driven delivery decay, yielding a break-even corridor beyond which net benefits vanish. Comparative statics characterize sensitivity to IT utilization, feedstock quality (waste LHV and throughput), climate parameterization, and corridor distance. We translate these accounting gains into decision language through a computable prototype for Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) and an ESG valuation channel grounded in measurable mechanisms, without re-deriving full lifecycle inventories. The framework provides siting-ready feasibility conditions for WtE-AIDC coupling in urban AI corridors under grid stress.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5e9f\u7269\u8f6c\u80fd\u7684\u70ed\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5438\u6536\u5f0f\u5236\u51b7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd Waste-to-Energy-AI \u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08WtE-AIDC\uff09\u8026\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5LCOC\u4e0eESG\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6269\u5f20\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7535\u529b\u4e0e\u5236\u51b7\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5236\u7ea6\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06\u5236\u51b7\u89c6\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u51b7\u5374\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7c7b\u80fd\u6e90\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u70ed-\u51b7\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u7ee9\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u900f\u660e\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u201c\u9ed1\u7bb1\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u4e4b\u5bf9\u7167\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u4ee5\u673a\u68b0\u5236\u51b7\u7531\u7535\u7f51\u4f9b\u7535\uff09\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u662f\u80fd\u91cf\u7b49\u7ea7\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5e9f\u7269\u711a\u70e7\u70ed\u8f93\u51fa\u9a71\u52a8\u5438\u6536\u5f0f\u5236\u51b7\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b7\u5374\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66ff\u4ee3\u57fa\u7ebf\u51b7\u5374\u7528\u7535\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5927\u4e00\u9636\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684 Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) \u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u7684 ESG \u4f30\u503c\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u57ce\u5e02\u8d70\u5eca\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u7ad9\u70b9\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": " thermoeconomic superiority \u7531\u4e09\u5927\u4e00\u9636\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u652f\u914d\uff1a(1) IT \u70ed\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u8986\u76d6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c(2) \u8f93\u9001\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u5bc4\u751f\u7535\u529b\uff0c(3) \u8ddd\u79bb\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u914d\u9001\u8870\u51cf\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u8d70\u5eca\u8ddd\u79bb\u540e\u51c0\u6536\u76ca\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u201c\u76c8\u4e8f\u5e73\u8861\u533a\u95f4\u201d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9 IT \u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u3001\u539f\u6599\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5e9f\u5f03\u7269\u4f4e\u4f4d\u70ed\u503c\u4e0e\u901a\u91cf\uff09\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ca\u8d70\u5eca\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u5c06\u4f1a\u8ba1\u589e\u76ca\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684 LCOC \u548c\u4ee5\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684 ESG \u4f30\u503c\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b8c\u6574\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6e05\u5355\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u9ad8\u7f51\u538b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9762\u5411\u57ce\u5e02 AI \u8d70\u5eca\u7684 WtE-AIDC \u8026\u5408\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e3a\u5728\u53d7\u7f51\u7535\u538b\u529b\u7684\u57ce\u5e02 AI \u8d70\u5eca\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72 WtE \u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8026\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u843d\u5730\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 LCOC \u4e0e ESG \u89c6\u89d2\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u3002"}}

Beyond a Boolean grid-based baseline that marks cells as in- or outside, we explore a distance-aware encoding approach that stores how far each cell is from a zone boundary and uses interpolation to reason within a cell.

We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $\u03b5$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PP-ACDC is a deterministic distributed algorithm for exact average consensus over strongly connected digraphs with a fixed, low number of quantization bits.

Leveraging the beam-squint effect inherent in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the proposed framework enables efficient two-dimensional angle estimation through a structured multi-stage sensing process. Specifically, the sensing procedure first searches over the elevation angle domain, followed by a dedicated search over the azimuth angle domain given the estimated elevation angles. In each stage, true-time-delay lines and phase shifters of the UPA are jointly configured to cover multiple grid points simultaneously across OFDM subcarriers. To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication.

Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy.

Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned.

Our results reveal that sensor-only detection outperforms full fusion by 8.3 percentage points (93.08% vs. 84.79% F1-score), challenging the assumption that additional modalities invariably improve performance. We further contribute an explainability pipeline integrating SHAP, temporal/spatial attention, and gate weight analysis.

This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate convergence and significant performance gains over benchmark schemes, highlighting the importance of coordinated time-power optimization in balancing sensing accuracy and communication performance in wireless powered ISAC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316WPT\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001ISAC\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fdISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4dCRB\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fd\u7684ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9b\u7ed9\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c sensing \u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6743\u8861\u3002WPT\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9b\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5CRB\u7ea6\u675f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u66ff\u6362\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7684 reformulation\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c(SCA)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fdISAC\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u529f\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fdISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9WPT\u65f6\u957f\u3001ISAC\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9aCRB\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Three-stage Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble RL (FineFT) for crypto futures trading under high leverage.

Despite being used in several recent studies, none has thoroughly analyzed its reliability against evasion attacks aimed at inflating the score of malicious packages, thereby masquerading them as trustworthy. To fill this gap, we first propose a threat model that identifies potential evasion approaches for each metric, including the URL confusion technique, which can affect 5 out of the 18 metrics by leveraging a URL pointing to a legitimate repository potentially unrelated to the malicious package.\n  Furthermore, we study the reliability of SourceRank in the PyPI ecosystem by analyzing the SourceRank distributions of benign and malicious packages in the state-of-the-art MalwareBench dataset, as well as in a real-world dataset of 122,398 packages. Our analysis reveals that, while historical data suggests a clear distinction between benign and malicious packages, the real-world distributions overlap significantly, mainly due to SourceRank's failure to timely reflect package removals. As a result, SourceRank cannot be reliably used to discriminate between benign and malicious packages in real-world scenarios, nor to select benign packages among those available on PyPI.\n  Finally, our analysis reveals that URL confusion represents an emerging attack vector, with its prevalence increasing from 4.2% in MalwareBench to 7.0% in our real-world dataset.

However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state.

Existing methods require specialized hardware, extensive calibration, or firmware modifications that are inaccessible to most users. This work presents a practical, end-to-end optimization framework that enhances high-speed printing using only standard 3D printers and a phone camera, without requiring additional complex setup. The method employs a one-shot calibration approach in which two simple printed patterns, captured by a phone camera, enable identification of extrusion dynamics and cornering behavior. The identified systems enable a model-based constrained optimal control strategy that generates optimized G-code, synchronizing motion and extrusion. Experiments show reduced width tracking error, mitigated corner defects, and lower surface roughness, achieving surface quality at 3600 mm/min comparable to conventional printing at 1600 mm/min, effectively doubling production speed while maintaining print quality. This accessible, hardware-minimal approach enables a wide range of fused filament fabrication users to achieve high-quality, high-speed additive manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u673a\u62cd\u7167\u7684\u4e00-shot\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5730\u63d0\u5347FDM 3D\u6253\u5370\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u6210\u5f62\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fbe\u52303600 mm/min\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e1600 mm/min\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6253\u5370\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7FDM\u6253\u5370\u673a\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u6253\u5370\u65f6\u56e0\u6324\u51fa\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u5c24\u5176\u8f6c\u89d2\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6324\u51fa\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6807\u5b9a\u6216\u56fa\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4e0d\u6613\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5370\u5237\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u624b\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u4e00-shot\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6324\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u8f6c\u89d2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684G-code\uff0c\u4f7f\u6253\u5370\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u6324\u51fa\u6d41\u91cf\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u6253\u5370\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57283600 mm/min\u7684\u626b\u63cf/\u7ebf\u5bbd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u8f6c\u89d2\u7f3a\u9677\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u500d\uff083600 mm/min\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u8d28\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f20\u7edf1600 mm/min\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6807\u51c6FDM\u6253\u5370\u673a\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u786c\u4ef6\u6216\u56fa\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6781\u5927\u9635\u5217\u8fd1\u573a\u8054\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684 CRB\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fd1\u573a/\u8fdc\u573a\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3001Fresnel \u4fee\u6b63\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "6G \u9700\u5728\u6781\u5927\u9635\u5217\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387 sensing\uff1b\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u524d\u4e3a\u7403\u9762\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8fdc\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6ce2\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7a84\u5e26\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e Slepian\u2013Bangs \u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001RCS \u7684\u95ed\u5f0f CRB\uff1b\u5728\u6162\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8fdc\u8fd1\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u89e3\u6790\u81ea\u4fe1\u606f\u9879\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u9879\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f CRB \u548c\u8fd1/\u8fdc\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u9635\u5217\u5b54\u5f84\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u6ce2\u957f\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u79ef\u5206\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6781\u9650\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c4\u5f8b\u543b\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a ELAAs \u4e0b\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5f15\uff1bPart II \u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u5e7f\u5e26\u5bbd\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eOFDM\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u8fd1\u573aCRBs\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u96f7\u8fbe\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\uff08RCS\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u786eFIM\u4e0eCRB\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8fd1\u573a/\u8fdc\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6781\u5927\u9635\u5217\uff08ELAAs\uff09\u548c\u5bbd\u5e26\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e0a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u8fdc\u573a\u5230\u8fd1\u573a\u3001\u4ece\u7a84\u5e26\u5230\u5bbd\u5e26\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6781\u9650\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5ef6\u7eedPart I\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5bbd\u5e26\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u5bbd\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u7403\u9762\u6ce2\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8de8\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Slepian\u2013Bangs\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u5bbd\u5e26Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001RCS\u7684CRB\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8fdc\u573a\u4e0e\u8fd1\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bbd\u5e26\u8fd1\u573a\u7684FIM\u4e0eCRB\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8fdc\u573a/\u8fd1\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u79ef\u5206\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u9635\u5217\u5b54\u5f84\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1CRB\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u5178\u578b\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u9635\u5217\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u653e\u5927\u7cfb\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5e7f\u5e26\u5bbd\u8fd1\u573a sensing \u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728ELAA\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5f15\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5bbd\u5e26\u4e0e\u8fd1\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6d4b\u901f\u548cRCS\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Comprehensive experimental validation in application-specific settings is deferred to a companion experimental study", "summary": "Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that decomposes error evolution into bias (drift), noise (stochastic variability), and alignment (recurrent excitation) to serve as a unified backbone across supervised optimization, actor-critic RL, and learned optimizers, enabling stable, interpretable online adaptation in nonstationary environments.", "motivation": "In nonstationary and safety-critical settings, learning systems often become unstable or converge slowly. While many optimization/RL/meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal. A principled, online diagnostic of error evolution could provide a robust, architecture- and task-agnostic control signal for adaptation.", "method": "Decompose error evolution into three components\u2014bias (persistent drift), noise (stochastic variability), and alignment (repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot). Compute these diagnostics online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference (TD) error trajectories. Build a unifying control backbone from these diagnostics and instantiate three algorithms: (i) a stabilized supervised optimizer, (ii) a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and (iii) a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer.

This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockchain provides a decentralized trust layer that reinforces transparency and integrity. A prototype was developed that comprises (i) an OCR-NLP extraction pipeline trained on synthetic datasets, (ii) a backend for credential issuance and management, and (iii) a frontend supporting issuer, holder, and verifier interactions. Experimental results show that the models achieve competitive accuracy across multiple document types and that the end-to-end pipeline reduces verification time while preserving reliability.

We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e24\u79cd\u987a\u5e8f\u8026\u5408\uff08\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5148\u4e0e\u6c61\u67d3\u4f18\u5148\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u4ec5\u9690\u79c1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ee5MLE\u98ce\u683c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6c61\u67d3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u7406\u8bba\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684 guarantees\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6c61\u67d3-\u5355\u72ec\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u8fdb\u754c\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u79c1\u6709\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6297\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff08\u5982\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u6c61\u67d3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u5b50\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u8026\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\uff08\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u4f18\u5148\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63a8\u5bfc\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83MLE\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u79c1\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u9690\u79c1\u72ec\u7acb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931+MLE\u98ce\u683c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6c61\u67d3-\u4ec5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u79c1\u6709\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6c61\u67d3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u81f3\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control.

The proposed random modulation constructs an equivalent dense and random channel matrix, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. It also guarantees the asymptotic replica maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit-error rate (BER) optimality of approximate message passing (AMP)-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices when their state evolution has a unique fixed point. Then, a low-complexity cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for random modulation, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the random transform-domain channel. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation schemes are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random-modulated linear systems, assuming the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. Numerical results show that the proposed random modulation can achieve BER and block-error rate (BLER) performance gains of up to 2 - 3 dB compared to existing OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with 5G-NR LDPC codes, under both average and optimized power allocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u77e9\u9635\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u8303\u6570\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u8c31\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b49\u6548\u7a20\u5bc6\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 AMP-type \u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684 replica MAP BER \u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u8bb0\u5fc6\u578b AMP(CD-MAMP)\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ca\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4 5G-NR LDPC \u7f16\u7801\u7684 OFDM/OTFS/AFDM\uff0cBER/BLER \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 2\u20133 dB\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u822c\u4fe1\u9053\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b AMP \u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u8870\u843d\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97 replica \u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u6c42\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5236\u6784\u9020\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4f7f\u4fe1\u9053\u8870\u843d\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u6709\u552f\u4e00\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cAMP \u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684 replica MAP BER \u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u57df\u8bb0\u5fc6\u578b AMP (CD-MAMP) \u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u53d8\u6362\u57df\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5728\u6709 CSI \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316 replica MAP BER\u3001\u6700\u5927\u5316 replica constrained capacity \u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ed9\u51fa replica MAP BER \u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa CD-MAMP \u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e0e OFDM/OTFS/AFDM+5G-NR LDPC \u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\uff0cBER/BLER \u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 2\u20133 dB\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\u5747\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5236\u4f7f\u5f97\u4efb\u610f\u8303\u6570\u754c\u9650\u4e14\u8c31\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4e5f\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u7b49\u6548\u7a20\u5bc6\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9 AMP \u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bridge-TS \u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u5411\u65f6\u5e8f\u586b\u8865\u7684 data-to-data \u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u7b49\u6765\u81ea\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728 ETT\u3001Exchange\u3001Weather \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ee5\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MSE\uff09\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001Schr\u00f6dinger \u6865\uff09\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d1f\u62c5\u5927\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63d2\u8865\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Bridge-TS\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1) \u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 Transformer \u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a ground-truth \u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2) \u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u590d\u5408\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63d2\u8865\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982 ETT\u3001Exchange\u3001Weather\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cBridge-TS \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684 MSE \u548c MAE\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u586b\u8865\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0cBridge-TS \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ca\u5bf9\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynRAG \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8 SIEM \u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5404 SIEM \u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u683c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684 SIEM \u751f\u6001\u591a\u6837\uff08Qradar\u3001SecOps\u3001Splunk\u3001Microsoft Sentinel\u3001Elastic Stack \u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9020\u6210\u5206\u6790\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u57f9\u8bad\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u683c\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807 SIEM \u7684\u4e13\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Qradar \u4e0e SecOps \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027 SIEM \u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e GPT\u3001Llama\u3001DeepSeek\u3001Gemma\u3001Claude \u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "SynRAG \u5728\u8de8 SIEM \u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8c03\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 Qradar \u4e0e SecOps \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u5bf9\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728\u5f02\u6784 SIEM \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8c03\u67e5\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines.

Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%.

To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528 Infini-attention \u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5728 16k \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u53ef\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa\u7ea6 31%\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\u5e73\u8861\u56e0\u5b50\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b97\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9 300M \u53c2\u6570\u7684 LLaMA \u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c Infini-attention \u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6765\u81ea\u5386\u53f2\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22/\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\u6b21\u6570\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u91cd\u590d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46 Infini-attention \u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728 16,384-token \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea6 31%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c Infini-attention \u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u63d0\u5347 SLM \u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper.

Although existing $w$-event local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms provide formal guarantees without relying on trusted third parties, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations. First, these methods are designed primarily for publishing simple statistics at each timestamp, making them inherently unsuitable for complex queries. Second, they handle data at each timestamp independently, failing to capture temporal correlations and consequently degrading the overall utility. To address these issues, we propose MTSP-LDP, a novel framework for \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{T}ask \\textbf{S}treaming data \\textbf{P}ublication under $w$-event LDP. MTSP-LDP adopts an \\emph{Optimal Privacy Budget Allocation} algorithm to dynamically allocate privacy budgets by analyzing temporal correlations within each window. It then constructs a \\emph{data-adaptive private binary tree structure} to support complex queries, which is further refined by cross-timestamp grouping and smoothing operations to enhance estimation accuracy. Furthermore, a unified \\emph{Budget-Free Multi-Task Processing} mechanism is introduced to support a variety of streaming queries without consuming additional privacy budget.

This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm toward provably secure AI. It controls risk by leveraging overlap in model output probabilities. However, we find that CS relies on frequent abstention to avoid unsafe outputs, which reduces utility. Moreover, CS becomes highly vulnerable when unsafe models are maliciously manipulated. To address these issues, we propose a new primitive called Reliable Consensus Sampling (RCS), that traces acceptance probability to tolerate extreme adversarial behaviors, improving robustness. RCS also eliminates the need for abstention entirely. We further develop a feedback algorithm to continuously and dynamically enhance the safety of RCS. We provide theoretical guarantees that RCS maintains a controllable risk threshold.

Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy.

In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\\mathsf p_{\\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\\sqrt{\\mathsf p_{\\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries.

We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERPM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u8ddd\u79bb/\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Stress\u3001\u90bb\u57df\u6392\u5e8f\u8bef\u5dee\u3001Local Procrustes\uff09\u5173\u6ce8\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u964d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u88ab\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEntropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM)\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u7684Shannon\u71b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6458\u8981\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684MRRE\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684Local Procrustes\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u6d41\u5f62\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u4f4e\uff1bERPM\u4e0eLocal Procrustes\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bf4\u660eERPM\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "ERPM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5982\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats.

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns.

We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior.

Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement.

Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains.

This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring.

Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts.

Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost.

The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences.

Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency.

While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4Pconf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528L1\u3001SCAD\u3001MCP\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u6700\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5e26\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763Pconf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f80\u5f80\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u73b0\u6709Pconf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684Pconf\u5206\u7c7b\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u51f8\u7684L1\u7f5a\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u7684SCAD\u3001MCP\u7f5a\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728L1\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6761\u4ef6Restricted Strong Convexity\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u7387\uff1b\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5408\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0cL1\u6b63\u5219\u7684Pconf\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u503c\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u5728RSC\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u5f31\u76d1\u7763Pconf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ef4Pconf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6ede\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u5355\u6b65\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u786e\u5b9a\u6027/\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u7684\u6ede\u540e\u72b6\u6001\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u9645\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528 ensemble \u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u7d2f\u8ba1 Wasserstein \u6f02\u79fb\u7b49\u4e0d\u9700\u8981 ground truth \u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Lorenz-63 \u4e0e Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky \u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u957f\u7a0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700 ground truth \u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness.

This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\\textbf{decoupled $\u03bc$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\\textbf{+2.69$\\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u5c42\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece token \u5c42\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a FLOPs \u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa compression-aware scaling law \u4e0e decoupled \u03bcP \u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728 R=4 \u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u88ab\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c12 \u9879\u96f6-shot \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 +2.69% \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709 token \u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u7b97\u529b\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DLCM \u8fd9\u4e00\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60 latent \u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8 token \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u5355\u4f4d\u5373\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa compression-aware scaling law\uff0c\u533a\u5206 token-level \u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fa\u5b9a FLOPs \u7684\u53ef principled compute allocation\u3002\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa decoupled \u03bcP \u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53ca\u538b\u7f29 regime \u7684\u96f6-shot\u8d85\u53c2\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u7f6e R=4\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u6982\u5ff54\u4e2a token\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cDLCM \u5c06\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6c\u79fb\u81f3\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406 FLOPs \u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97 +2.69% \u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8986\u76d6 12 \u9879\u96f6-shot \u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u7ea7\u538b\u7f29\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6807\u5b9a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0ccompression-aware scaling law \u4e0e decoupled \u03bcP \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a FLOPs \u4e0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6-shot \u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent).

This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.\n  We propose \\textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa DCL-DECOR\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6210\u5206\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6210\u5206\u6765\u53bb\u6df7\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0 DAG \u5b66\u4e60\u6062\u590d\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 bow-freeness \u7b80\u5316\u4e0e\u6574\u5408\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u666e\u904d\u6027\u6df7\u6742\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u5f3a\u3002\u5168\u5c40\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8/\u65e0\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u666e\u904d\u6027\u6df7\u6742\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DCL-DECOR \u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6210\u5206\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u53bb\u9664\u666e\u904d\u6027\u6df7\u6742\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4ec5\u7531\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u6df7\u6742\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u53bb\u6df7\u540e\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0 DAG \u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f3a\u5236 bow-freeness \u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u89e3\u3002\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u82e5\u5e72\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u666e\u904d\u6027\u6df7\u6742\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cDCL-DECOR \u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0 DAG \u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u6062\u590d\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6df7\u6742\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408N:M\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u88c1\u526a\u548c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CPU\u3001GPU\u548cFPGA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5229\u75282:4\u7a00\u758f+\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728LLaMA-7B\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5148\u8fdb\u884cN:M\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u88c1\u526a\uff08\u4ee52:4\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u548c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u652f\u6301Dense\u30012:4\u7a00\u758f\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u7684FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\uff08CPU\u3001NVIDIA GPU\u7684Dense\u4e0e2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores\u3001\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49FPGA\uff09\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u57284096\u00d74096\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u591a4\u00d7\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u7ea61.71\u00d7\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6GPU\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea61.29\u00d7\uff1b\u5bf9LLaMA-7B\u8fdb\u884c\u653e\u5927\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf/\u6bcf\u4e2atoken 1.36\u00d7\u3002\u663e\u793aN:M\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "N:M\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0cFPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9a2:4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \\& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u6b66\u6c49\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u516d\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u6784\u5ff5\u5bf9\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u6700\u5f3a\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u4f18\u826f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u5ba3\u4f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u8865\u6587\u732e\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u4e3a\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u5377\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9762\u5411\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u767e\u5ea6\u963f\u6ce2\u7f57Robotaxi\u5728\u6b66\u6c49\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff08\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c336\u4efd\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08SEM\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u516d\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u6784\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9891\u6b21\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u4e4b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6784\u5ff5\uff1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3001\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\uff1b\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u5411\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6700\u5f3a\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u5176\u4ed6\u6784\u5ff5\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u8f83\u4e3a\u7ec6\u81f4\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u62df\u5408\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u7684 policymaking\u3001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u63a8\u5e7f\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Du"], "title": "Unregularized Linear Convergence in Zero-Sum Game from Preference Feedback", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity.

We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training.

We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected.

Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning.

Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without.

Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and geometrically equivalent representations. Our methodology goes beyond the interpretation of individual neurons and weights. Instead, we identify all of the neurons corresponding to each learned representation and then study the collective group of neurons as one entity. This method reveals that each learned representation is a manifold that we can study utilizing tools from topology. Based on this insight, we can statistically analyze the learned representations across hundreds of circuits to demonstrate the similarity between learned modular addition circuits that arise naturally from common deep learning paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ece\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u524d\u77bb\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002OpenForecaster 8B\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5916\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u907f\u514d\u672a\u6765\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5168\u7403\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6OpenForesight\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b0\u95fb\u8bed\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u5728Qwen3\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u57282025\u5e745\u20138\u6708\u8fdb\u884c held-out \u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "OpenForecaster 8B\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6539\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0eRL\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
