TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个统一的评估套件，标准化MAS配置与执行，提供可复现的执行轨迹和系统信号。实验表明MAS结构稳定但性能波动显著，架构比模型或工具更关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAS测试缺乏标准化和可复现性，导致性能与可靠性难以评估，亟需统一评估平台以揭示配置与架构对资源和效果的影响。

Method: 构建统一的MAS接口和适配器，生成无框架执行轨迹与系统级信号，采集12个代表性MAS在不同模型和工具配置下的重复实验数据进行分析。

Result: 发现MAS执行在结构上稳定但时间上波动大，运行间性能与可靠性差异显著；架构对资源消耗与成本-延迟-准确率平衡的影响远超模型与工具设置。

Conclusion: MAESTRO完善了LLM基于多智能体系统（MAS）的评估方法，能够系统评估其可靠性、观测性和资源使用，为MAS的设计与优化提供实证指导。

Abstract: We present MAESTRO, an evaluation suite for the testing, reliability, and observability of LLM-based MAS. MAESTRO standardizes MAS configuration and execution through a unified interface, supports integrating both native and third-party MAS via a repository of examples and lightweight adapters, and exports framework-agnostic execution traces together with system-level signals (e.g., latency, cost, and failures). We instantiate MAESTRO with 12 representative MAS spanning popular agentic frameworks and interaction patterns, and conduct controlled experiments across repeated runs, backend models, and tool configurations. Our case studies show that MAS executions can be structurally stable yet temporally variable, leading to substantial run-to-run variance in performance and reliability. We further find that MAS architecture is the dominant driver of resource profiles, reproducibility, and cost-latency-accuracy trade-off, often outweighing changes in backend models or tool settings. Overall, MAESTRO enables systematic evaluation and provides empirical guidance for designing and optimizing agentic systems.

Abstract: Production LLM agents with tool-using capabilities require security testing despite their safety training. We adapt Go-Explore to evaluate GPT-4o-mini across 28 experimental runs spanning six research questions. We find that random-seed variance dominates algorithmic parameters, yielding an 8x spread in outcomes; single-seed comparisons are unreliable, while multi-seed averaging materially reduces variance in our setup. Reward shaping consistently harms performance, causing exploration collapse in 94% of runs or producing 18 false positives with zero verified attacks. In our environment, simple state signatures outperform complex ones. For comprehensive security testing, ensembles provide attack-type diversity, whereas single agents optimize coverage within a given attack type. Overall, these results suggest that seed variance and targeted domain knowledge can outweigh algorithmic sophistication when testing safety-trained models.

Abstract: Android Permission Model and Application (app) analysis has consistently remained the focus of the investigation of research groups and stakeholders of the Android ecosystem since it was launched in 2008. Even though the Android smartphone operating system (OS) permission model has evolved significantly from `all-or-none access' to `user-chosen dangerous resource access', specific challenges and issues remain unresolved even after 15 years after the smartphone OS launch. This study addresses the issues and documents the research work in this arena through a comprehensive literature survey and comparative analysis.
  The survey's focal point is the Android permission model and relevant research between 2010-2022. We systematize the knowledge on (i) Android API Calls to permissions mapping, (ii) Android Permissions evolution, and (iii) how permissions are checked. Furthermore, the survey identifies the permission-related issues and relevant research addressed during the last decade. We reference seminal work in these areas. We summarize the identified research gaps and present future directions for early and experienced researchers.

Abstract: In recent decades, the RAFT distributed consensus algorithm has become a main pillar of the distributed systems ecosystem, ensuring data consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. Although the fact that RAFT is well known for its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency, its security properties are not fully recognized, leaving implementations vulnerable to different kinds of attacks and threats, which can transform the RAFT harmony of consensus into a chaos of data inconsistency. This paper presents a systematic security analysis of the RAFT protocol, with a specific focus on its susceptibility to security threats such as message replay attacks and message forgery attacks. Examined how a malicious actor can exploit the protocol's message-passing mechanism to reintroduce old messages, disrupting the consensus process and leading to data inconsistency. The practical feasibility of these attacks is examined through simulated scenarios, and the key weaknesses in RAFT's design that enable them are identified. To address these vulnerabilities, a novel approach based on cryptography, authenticated message verification, and freshness check is proposed. This proposed solution provides a framework for enhancing the security of the RAFT implementations and guiding the development of more resilient distributed systems.

### [5] [NOS-Gate: Queue-Aware Streaming IDS for Consumer Gateways under Timing-Controlled Evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00389)
*Muhammad Bilal,Omer Tariq,Hasan Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 轻量级 NOS‑Gate 通过二态 NOS 单元和 K‑of‑M 规则，在仅使用元数据、低 CPU 与时延预算的消费网关上实现高召回率的实时入侵检测，并降低尾部延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密流的时序与突发模式会泄露信息，可被自适应攻击者利用，导致仅元数据检测失效；因此需要在资源受限的消费者网关上进行高效流式入侵检测。

Method: 在每条流上构建轻量级二态 NOS 单元，利用固定窗口的元数据特征评分，并采用 K‑of‑M 持续规则触发可逆的流量惩罚；惩罚通过在权重公平队列（WFQ）中暂时降低流量权重。

Result: 在多重可重复的“世界”基准场景下，NOS‑Gate 在 0.1% FP 下召回率 0.952，优于最优基线 0.857；并在封口下将 p99.9 队列延迟和 p99.9 副作用延迟降低，且平均评分成本仅约 2.09 μs/流窗口。

Conclusion: NOS‑Gate 能在仅利用元数据的情况下，在保持低假阳性率（0.1%）的前提下，比现有基线恢复97% 的事件召回率，并显著降低队列尾端延迟，同时 CPU 计算成本极低。

Abstract: Timing and burst patterns can leak through encryption, and an adaptive adversary can exploit them. This undermines metadata-only detection in a stand-alone consumer gateway. Therefore, consumer gateways need streaming intrusion detection on encrypted traffic using metadata only, under tight CPU and latency budgets. We present a streaming IDS for stand-alone gateways that instantiates a lightweight two-state unit derived from Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) dynamics per flow, named NOS-Gate. NOS-Gate scores fixed-length windows of metadata features and, under a $K$-of-$M$ persistence rule, triggers a reversible mitigation that temporarily reduces the flow's weight under weighted fair queueing (WFQ). We evaluate NOS-Gate under timing-controlled evasion using an executable 'worlds' benchmark that specifies benign device processes, auditable attacker budgets, contention structure, and packet-level WFQ replay to quantify queue impact. All methods are calibrated label-free via burn-in quantile thresholding. Across multiple reproducible worlds and malicious episodes, at an achieved $0.1%$ false-positive operating point, NOS-Gate attains 0.952 incident recall versus 0.857 for the best baseline in these runs. Under gating, it reduces p99.9 queueing delay and p99.9 collateral delay with a mean scoring cost of ~ 2.09 μs per flow-window on CPU.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AURA通过注入假数据（致伤剂）使被窃取的KG在未授权者手中失效，授权者凭密钥可过滤，无明显性能损失，并能抵御清洗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在知识密集型场景下，组织内部的知识图谱（KG）构成了重要知识产权。由于攻击者往往只能在隔离环境中使用，被窃取的KG不能通过水印等被动防御手段检测，也无法使用强加密（会导致可观的延迟开销）。因此，需要一种既不增加显著延迟又能在KG被窃后变得无用的保护方案。

Method: 提出AURA框架，基于数据劣化（Data Adulteration）提前向KG注入可信但错误的“致伤剂”(adulterants)。授权用户凭借密钥可在向LLM输入前，通过加密的元数据标签快速过滤这些致伤剂，从而保持检索和生成结果的准确性；而未授权用户无法过滤，致伤剂则导致检索上下文失真，生成答案错误。

Result: 在未授权系统上，AURA将准确率下跌至仅5.3%，同时保持授权用户100%准确率，且对系统的开销极小。对抗各种数据清洗攻击时，致伤剂保留率高达80.2%。

Conclusion: AURA为图检索增强生成技术提供了一种实用且低延迟的知识产权防护策略，能够在KG被窃后迅速失效，却不影响合法用户的正常使用。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a key technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in knowledge-intensive applications. As these KGs often represent an organization's highly valuable intellectual property (IP), they face a significant risk of theft for private use. In this scenario, attackers operate in isolated environments. This private-use threat renders passive defenses like watermarking ineffective, as they require output access for detection. Simultaneously, the low-latency demands of GraphRAG make strong encryption which incurs prohibitive overhead impractical. To address these challenges, we propose AURA, a novel framework based on Data Adulteration designed to make any stolen KG unusable to an adversary. Our framework pre-emptively injects plausible but false adulterants into the KG. For an attacker, these adulterants deteriorate the retrieved context and lead to factually incorrect responses. Conversely, for authorized users, a secret key enables the efficient filtering of all adulterants via encrypted metadata tags before they are passed to the LLM, ensuring query results remain completely accurate. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach: AURA degrades the performance of unauthorized systems to an accuracy of just 5.3%, while maintaining 100% fidelity for authorized users with negligible overhead. Furthermore, AURA proves robust against various sanitization attempts, retaining 80.2% of its adulterants.

TL;DR: Diamond为物联网提供高效前向安全聚合鉴别加密方案，显著降低离线预处理与终端延迟，并在多平台上优于现有方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为资源受限的物联网设备在恶劣无线环境中提供具前向安全、标签聚合与在线离线优化的轻量级鉴别加密框架

Method: 提出Diamond——基于轻量级关键演化、在线离线优化流程、可层级化实例化的通用前向安全聚合鉴别加密(Secure Forward‑Secure Aggregate Authenticated Encryption)

Result: 在64/32/8位 ARM/AVR 架构上，Diamond 将离线预处理缩短47%，批量终端延迟降低一倍以上；在加密吞吐、验证延迟、标签聚合和漏洞弹性上均优于基准FAA和NIST轻量级AE候选方案

Conclusion: Diamond实现了理论安全证明、可定制化多级实现，并在多种设备上表现出优秀的性能与安全性，已公开源码便于复现与集成

Abstract: Resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices, from medical implants to small drones, must transmit sensitive telemetry under adversarial wireless channels while operating under stringent computing and energy budgets. Authenticated Encryption (AE) is essential for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. However, existing lightweight AE standards lack forward-security guarantees, compact tag aggregation, and offline-online (OO) optimizations required for modern high-throughput IoT pipelines.
  We introduce Diamond, the first provable secure Forward-secure and Aggregate Authenticated Encryption (FAAE) framework that extends and generalizes prior FAAE constructions through a lightweight key evolution mechanism, an OO-optimized computation pipeline, and a set of performance-tiered instantiations tailored to heterogeneous IoT platforms. Diamond substantially reduces amortized offline preprocessing (up to 47%) and achieves up to an order-ofmagnitude reduction in end-to-end latency for large telemetry batches. Our comprehensive evaluation across 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72, 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4, and 8-bit AVR architectures confirms that Diamond consistently outperforms baseline FAAE variants and NIST lightweight AE candidates across authenticated encryption throughput and end-to-end verification latency while maintaining compact tag aggregation and strong breach resilience. We formally prove the security of Diamond and provide two concrete instantiations optimized for compliance and high efficiency. Our open-source release enables reproducibility and seamless integration into IoT platforms.

TL;DR: 使用GPT‑3.5‑Turbo实现高精度的IoT评论S&P关注检测，揭示摄像头关注度最高，用户持续关注监控与数据控制，为开发者提供改进数据控制的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解IoT用户的安全与隐私关注对开发者与用户双方都具有重要价值，需系统性方法捕捉大规模评论中的隐私议题。

Method: 采用GPT‑3.5‑Turbo进行动态少样本提示，构建Classifier‑Rationalizer‑Categorizer与Thematic Mapper两模型，形成自动管道，对91K条Amazon IoT评论进行检测、分类与主题映射。

Result: 通过该管道实现97%+精确率与召回率，远优于关键字与传统机器学习方法；对五类设备平均识别5%关注度，摄像头最高10%；识别S&P相关评论显著多于先前工作，长周期分析显示监控与数据控制等关注持续存在。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，有效识别并归类用户在IoT评论中表述的安全与隐私关注能为行业提供深刻见解，帮助开发者提升用户信任和满意度。

Abstract: Being able to understand the security and privacy (S&P) concerns of IoT users brings benefits to both developers and users. To learn about users' views, we examine Amazon IoT reviews - one of the biggest IoT markets. This work presents a state-of-the-art methodology to identify and categorize reviews in which users express S&P concerns. We developed an automated pipeline by fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to build two models: the Classifier-Rationalizer-Categorizer and the Thematic Mapper. By leveraging dynamic few-shot prompting and the model's large context size, our pipeline achieved over 97% precision and recall, significantly outperforming keyword-based and classical ML methods. We applied our pipeline to 91K Amazon reviews about fitness trackers, smart speakers and cameras, over multiple years. We found that on average 5% contained S&P concerns, while security camera exhibited the highest prevalence at 10%. Our method detected significantly more S&P-relevant reviews than prior works: 15x more for fitness trackers, 29% more for smart speakers, and 70% more for cameras. Our longitudinal analysis reveals that concerns like surveillance and data control have persisted for years, suggesting limited industry progress. We demonstrate that across all device types, users consistently demand more precise control over what data is collected and shared. We uncover challenges in multi-user and multi-device interactions, identifying two previously unreported themes concerning inadequate controls for account separation and data access. These findings, ranging from broad persistent trends to specific instances of customer loss, offer actionable insights for developers to improve user satisfaction and trust.

*Prajwal Panth,Sahaj Raj Malla*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出 CPPDD：轻量级、后期自动化、多客户端安全聚合协议，结合仿射掩码与共识锁定，实现无持续协调的完整性验证和恶意中止，实验显示高效、可扩展并优于现有 MPC/HE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足在受监管或资源受限的环境中实现可扩展、低信任、可验证多方计算的需求，弥补传统 MPC/HE 在复杂度与资源占用上的短板。

Method: 使用双层保护机制：每客户端仿射掩码 + 优先级驱动的顺序共识锁定，并通过 sigma_S 与 sigma_D 校验实现去中心化完整性验证。

Result: 在 MNIST 向量实验中，CPPDD 具备线性可扩展性（N≤500），每客户端计算低毫秒级，100% 检测恶意偏差，数据恢复完全，且 FLOPs 与 MPC/HE 相比低 3–4 个数量级。

Conclusion: CPPDD 框架提供一种轻量化、去中心化的多客户端安全聚合协议，能够在无需持续协调的情况下自动检测恶意偏差并中止，确保数据完整性与公平性。

Abstract: We propose the Consensus-Based Privacy-Preserving Data Distribution (CPPDD) framework, a lightweight and post-setup autonomous protocol for secure multi-client data aggregation. The framework enforces unanimous-release confidentiality through a dual-layer protection mechanism that combines per-client affine masking with priority-driven sequential consensus locking. Decentralized integrity is verified via step (sigma_S) and data (sigma_D) checksums, facilitating autonomous malicious deviation detection and atomic abort without requiring persistent coordination. The design supports scalar, vector, and matrix payloads with O(N*D) computation and communication complexity, optional edge-server offloading, and resistance to collusion under N-1 corruptions. Formal analysis proves correctness, Consensus-Dependent Integrity and Fairness (CDIF) with overwhelming-probability abort on deviation, and IND-CPA security assuming a pseudorandom function family. Empirical evaluations on MNIST-derived vectors demonstrate linear scalability up to N = 500 with sub-millisecond per-client computation times. The framework achieves 100% malicious deviation detection, exact data recovery, and three-to-four orders of magnitude lower FLOPs compared to MPC and HE baselines. CPPDD enables atomic collaboration in secure voting, consortium federated learning, blockchain escrows, and geo-information capacity building, addressing critical gaps in scalability, trust minimization, and verifiable multi-party computation for regulated and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents are increasingly deployed as AI teammates in modern software engineering, independently authoring pull requests (PRs) that modify production code at scale. This study aims to systematically characterize how autonomous coding agents contribute to software security in practice, how these security-related contributions are reviewed and accepted, and which observable signals are associated with PR rejection. We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent-authored PRs using the AIDev dataset, comprising of over 33,000 curated PRs from popular GitHub repositories. Security-relevant PRs are identified using a keyword filtering strategy, followed by manual validation, resulting in 1,293 confirmed security-related agentic-PRs. We then analyze prevalence, acceptance outcomes, and review latency across autonomous agents, programming ecosystems, and types of code changes. Moreover, we apply qualitative open coding to identify recurring security-related actions and underlying intents, and examine review metadata to identify early signals associated with PR rejection. Security-related Agentic-PRs constitute a meaningful share of agent activity (approximately 4\%). Rather than focusing solely on narrow vulnerability fixes, agents most frequently perform supportive security hardening activities, including testing, documentation, configuration, and improved error handling. Compared to non-security PRs, security-related Agentic-PRs exhibit lower merge rates and longer review latency, reflecting heightened human scrutiny, with variation across agents and programming ecosystems. PR rejection is more strongly associated with PR complexity and verbosity than with explicit security topics.

TL;DR: 通过检索增强和多工具自我修复，LLM 代码生成安全与鲁棒性大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM 代码生成常伴随安全漏洞、逻辑与编译错误，先行研究显示结构化反馈、静态分析、检索增强和基于执行的精炼对提升效果有显著帮助。

Method: 构建了一个含检索增强的多工具修复工作流：利用编译器诊断、CodeQL 安全扫描和 KLEE 符号执行，LLM 迭代细化生成结果；并使用轻量级嵌入模型语义检索先前成功修复案例，为生成提供安全导向示例。

Result: 在 3,242 条 DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B 与 CodeLlama-7B 生成的程序上评估，DeepSeek 的安全漏洞率降低 96%；CodeLlama 的关键安全缺陷率从 58.55% 降至 22.19%。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在代码生成过程中应用检索增强和多工具修复流程，可显著提升大型语言模型生成代码的安全性和鲁棒性，尤其在对抗“顽固”模型时效果突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code but often introduce security vulnerabilities, logical inconsistencies, and compilation errors. Prior work demonstrates that LLMs benefit substantially from structured feedback, static analysis, retrieval augmentation, and execution-based refinement. We propose a retrieval-augmented, multi-tool repair workflow in which a single code-generating LLM iteratively refines its outputs using compiler diagnostics, CodeQL security scanning, and KLEE symbolic execution. A lightweight embedding model is used for semantic retrieval of previously successful repairs, providing security-focused examples that guide generation. Evaluated on a combined dataset of 3,242 programs generated by DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B and CodeLlama-7B, the system demonstrates significant improvements in robustness. For DeepSeek, security vulnerabilities were reduced by 96%. For the larger CodeLlama model, the critical security defect rate was decreased from 58.55% to 22.19%, highlighting the efficacy of tool-assisted self-repair even on "stubborn" models.

TL;DR: LLM 理解语义，但缺乏结构推理能力；符号推理稳定；建议采用符号+LLM 的混合模型来提升 IoT 规则安全检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别智能家居 IoT 平台规则交互中的隐式冲突与不安全行为，为设备安全提供可靠检测手段。

Method: 对 openHAB 规则集及其结构扰动的 Mutation 数据集进行零/一/二轮提示，让多型号 LLM（Llama 3.1/70B、GPT‑4o、Gemini‑2.5‑Pro、DeepSeek‑R1）完成分类任务；同时评估符号基线在相同性能对比。

Result: LLM 在动作/条件相关威胁上表现良好，但在跨规则结构推理上准确率骤降，尤其在 Mutation 数据集更为突出；符号基线保持稳定，但误报高。

Conclusion: LLM虽具语义理解优势，但在涉及跨规则结构推理的 IoT 交互威胁检测上准确率显著下降，无法替代传统符号推理；但结合两者的混合架构或有望平衡减少误报与结构严谨性。

Abstract: Smart home IoT platforms such as openHAB rely on Trigger Action Condition (TAC) rules to automate device behavior, but the interplay among these rules can give rise to interaction threats, unintended or unsafe behaviors emerging from implicit dependencies, conflicting triggers, or overlapping conditions. Identifying these threats requires semantic understanding and structural reasoning that traditionally depend on symbolic, constraint-driven static analysis. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a multi-category interaction threat taxonomy, assessing their performance on both the original openHAB (oHC/IoTB) dataset and a structurally challenging Mutation dataset designed to test robustness under rule transformations. We benchmark Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 70B, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 across zero-, one-, and two-shot settings, comparing their results against oHIT's manually validated ground truth. Our findings show that while LLMs exhibit promising semantic understanding, particularly on action- and condition-related threats, their accuracy degrades significantly for threats requiring cross-rule structural reasoning, especially under mutated rule forms. Model performance varies widely across threat categories and prompt settings, with no model providing consistent reliability. In contrast, the symbolic reasoning baseline maintains stable detection across both datasets, unaffected by rule rewrites or structural perturbations. These results underscore that LLMs alone are not yet dependable for safety critical interaction-threat detection in IoT environments. We discuss the implications for tool design and highlight the potential of hybrid architectures that combine symbolic analysis with LLM-based semantic interpretation to reduce false positives while maintaining structural rigor.

TL;DR: LoRA在联邦学习中的低秩矩阵分离提交方式存在安全缺口，GAP利用这一点悄无声息地植入恶意更新，攻击效果显著且难以被常规检测方法捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA只验证最终的AB产品，而不验证单独提交的A和B，导致系统缺乏对训练更新的完整性检查，构成攻击窗口。

Method: 通过在不接触训练数据或进行横向协同的前提下，分别制造看似正常的低秩矩阵A和B，使得它们的乘积AB将恶意更新注入模型。

Result: 在LLaMA、ChatGLM和GPT-2等模型上验证，GAP能将BLEU降低14.5%，事实与语法错误率增加800%以上，同时保留92.6%的长文本回复长度。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LoRA在联邦学习环境下的隐藏脆弱性，并提出了一种通过Gradient Assembly Poisoning（GAP）发动的隐蔽持续攻击，能够在不影响表面流畅度的情况下显著削弱大型语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings, dramatically reducing update costs by introducing trainable low-rank matrices. However, when integrated with frameworks like FedIT, LoRA introduces a critical vulnerability: clients submit $A$ and $B$ matrices separately, while only their product $AB$ determines the model update, yet this composite is never directly verified. We propose Gradient Assembly Poisoning (GAP), a novel attack that exploits this blind spot by crafting individually benign $A$ and $B$ matrices whose product yields malicious updates. GAP operates without access to training data or inter-client coordination and remains undetected by standard anomaly detectors. We identify four systemic vulnerabilities in LoRA-based federated systems and validate GAP across LLaMA, ChatGLM, and GPT-2. GAP consistently induces degraded or biased outputs while preserving surface fluency, reducing BLEU by up to 14.5\%, increasing factual and grammatical errors by over 800\%, and maintaining 92.6\% long-form response length. These results reveal a new class of stealthy, persistent threats in distributed LoRA fine-tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对ICV全局漏洞的系统化认识，且以往研究多基于主观分析，缺乏实验证据。

Method: 首先综述现有ICV安全文献，随后收集并分析来自八项漏洞竞赛及研究者提交的649个漏洞数据，评估现有分类法覆盖率并发现空白。

Result: 鉴别出一类新漏洞位置及13种新漏洞类型，并对漏洞进行6类威胁、4级风险的细分。

Conclusion: 本研究首次通过大规模实证分析，系统识别了ICV系统中存在的48辆车辆的649个可利用漏洞，填补了之前研究的不足并提供了新的漏洞位置和类型。

Abstract: Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICVs) are a core component of modern transportation systems, and their security is crucial as it directly relates to user safety. Despite prior research, most existing studies focus only on specific sub-components of ICVs due to their inherent complexity. As a result, there is a lack of systematic understanding of ICV vulnerabilities. Moreover, much of the current literature relies on human subjective analysis, such as surveys and interviews, which tends to be high-level and unvalidated, leaving a significant gap between theoretical findings and real-world attacks. To address this issue, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study on ICV vulnerabilities. We began by analyzing existing ICV security literature and summarizing the prevailing taxonomies in terms of vulnerability locations and types. To evaluate their real-world relevance, we collected a total of 649 exploitable vulnerabilities, including 592 from eight ICV vulnerability discovery competitions, Anonymous Cup, between January 2023 and April 2024, covering 48 different vehicles. The remaining 57 vulnerabilities were submitted daily by researchers. Based on this dataset, we assessed the coverage of existing taxonomies and identified several gaps, discovering one new vulnerability location and 13 new vulnerability types. We further categorized these vulnerabilities into 6 threat types (e.g., privacy data breach) and 4 risk levels (ranging from low to critical) and analyzed participants' skills and the types of ICVs involved in the competitions. This study provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of ICV vulnerabilities, offering actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers. To support future research, we have made our vulnerability dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Previous work on home router security has shown that using system calls to train a transformer-based language model built on a BERT-style encoder using contrastive learning is effective in detecting several types of malware, but the performance remains limited at low false positive rates. In this work, we demonstrate that using a high-fidelity eBPF-based system call sensor, together with contrastive augmented learning (which introduces controlled mutations of negative samples), improves detection performance at a low false positive rate. In addition, we introduce a network packet abstraction language that enables the creation of a pipeline similar to network packet data, and we show that network behavior provides complementary detection signals-yielding improved performance for network-focused malware at low false positive rates. Lastly, we implement these methods in an online router anomaly detection framework to validate the approach in an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment environment.

*Lesley Wheat,Martin v. Mohrenschildt,Saeid Habibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文在合成业务数据上对14种异常检测器进行系统评估，发现最佳模型受训练集故障样本数影响。少于20个故障时无监督（kNN/LOF）占优；30‑50个故障时半监督XGBOD与监督SVM/CatBoost效果显著。特征维度和数据规模亦显著改变性能，结果为工业级异常检测部署提供实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业系统的质量控制与预测性维护面临极端类别不平衡的问题，缺少足够故障数据，亟需评估各类异常检测算法在稀缺故障样本下的表现。

Method: 使用二维与十维超球形模拟异常分布的合成数据，构建12万样本（训练1 000—10 000例，测试4 0000例），遍历异常率0.05%–20%，评估14种无监督、半监督、监督检测器（包含kNN/LOF、XGBOD、SVM/CatBoost等）性能与泛化误差。

Result: 展示了不同异常样本数量与特征维度下各检测器的效能曲线，指出仅添加健康样本收益有限；无监督方法在极少故障样本时优先；半监督与监督方法在出现约30‑50故障样本时能快速提升准确率；小样本规模导致泛化误差激增，提供实用部署建议。

Conclusion: 检测器最佳性能高度依赖训练集中故障样本数量，少于20个无缺陷样本表现仍以无监督方法为主；30‑50个故障样本时半监督和监督方法可显著提升；特征维度及数据集规模对泛化能力影响显著，提示工业部署需慎选模型与样本配比。

Abstract: Machine learning offers potential solutions to current issues in industrial systems in areas such as quality control and predictive maintenance, but also faces unique barriers in industrial applications. An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.

TL;DR: 模型组合技术引入的tokenizer transplant步骤存在安全缺陷，通过设计“breaker token”可在不影响供体模型实用性的前提下，破坏基模型生成，实验验证攻击有效且持久。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模型组合和tokenizer transplant日益流行的生态中，需评估尚未显现的安全隐患；目标是揭露并评估此环节对模型安全的新威胁。

Method: 通过设计功能无害的“breaker token”，利用模型权重共用几何特性，将其从供体模型转移至基模型后在嵌入空间中重塑为高显著性的恶意特征；攻击形式化为双目标优化，使用稀疏求解器实现。

Result: 攻击无需额外训练即可实现，能够通过谱模拟规避异常检测，并在微调或权重合并后仍保留破坏效果；实验显示攻击成功率高且对供体模型未造成显著干扰。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了在LLM模型模块化组合过程中的“tokenizer transplant”环节所隐藏的供应链漏洞，提出并验证了“breaker token”攻击手段，可在不影响原模型性能的前提下破坏目标模型的生成能力，强调此类漏洞对AI系统安全的潜在威胁。

Abstract: The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single "breaker token" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of preserving semantic meaning in communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.

TL;DR: 提出一种渐近随时有效的 BAI 方法，兼顾非参数灵活性与协变量，样本复杂度接近最优，并在实验中显示出更低的平均样本需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在固定置信度最佳臂识别（BAI）问题中，传统方法在严格误差控制时往往要么使用宽松尾部不等式，要么受到参数化限制，导致在弱信号、高显著性及需要后续推断的实际情境下表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种放宽的形式：相对于最小样本量，只在渐近上实现有效误差控制；构建了新的渐近随时有效置信序列（任何臂索引），并以此设计一套适用于该框架的 BA 算法，可灵活加入协变量进行方差削减，且在全非参数环境下保持近似误差控制。

Result: 在弱收敛假设下给出了样本复杂度的渐近上界，并证明其最坏情况的样本复杂度与已知方差下完全误差保证的高斯 BAI 的最优情况相匹配；实验表明该方法在保持误差控制的同时平均样本复杂度更低。

Conclusion: 提供了一种在实际任务中可行且在理论上与最优方法相当的渐近随时有效的 BAI 方案，兼顾了非参数灵活性和协变量利用，显著降低了实际样本量需求。

Abstract: In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for equation discovery, yet their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, a phenomenon we term instruction brittleness. Static prompts cannot adapt to the evolving state of a multi-step generation process, causing models to plateau at suboptimal solutions. To address this, we propose NeuroSymBO, which reframes prompt engineering as a sequential decision problem. Our method maintains a discrete library of reasoning strategies and uses Bayesian Optimization to select the optimal instruction at each step based on numerical feedback. Experiments on PDE discovery benchmarks show that adaptive instruction selection significantly outperforms fixed prompts, achieving higher recovery rates with more parsimonious solutions.

Motivation: 在联邦学习场景下，高效微调大语言模型，兼顾隐私与低算力设备的限制，提升模型性能；

Method: 提出HFedMoE框架：①基于专家对微调性能的贡献度评估专家重要性；②从信息瓶颈维度自适应选取满足设备算力的专家子集；③设计稀疏感知聚合策略，对活跃专家和门控参数按重要性加权聚合；

Result: 实验表明HFedMoE在训练精度和收敛速度上均优于现有最先进基准；

Conclusion: HFedMoE有效解决了专家选择、异构算力与聚合干扰三大挑战，显著提升了资源受限设备上的LLM微调性能；

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) without compromising data privacy, the substantial size of an LLM renders on-device training impractical for resource-constrained clients, such as mobile devices. Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在线性逼近的强化学习方法在非马尔可夫状态和成本过程下的收敛性，并提供了对局部状态表示的部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程的误差界限。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning methods with linear function approximation under non-Markov state and cost processes. We first consider the policy evaluation method and show that the algorithm converges under suitable ergodicity conditions on the underlying non-Markov processes. Furthermore, we show that the limit corresponds to the fixed point of a joint operator composed of an orthogonal projection and the Bellman operator of an auxiliary \emph{Markov} decision process.
  For Q-learning with linear function approximation, as in the Markov setting, convergence is not guaranteed in general. We show, however, that for the special case where the basis functions are chosen based on quantization maps, the convergence can be shown under similar ergodicity conditions. Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.

TL;DR: 研究提出基于最优输运的联邦逆强化学习框架：客户端先本地求解最大熵 IRL，随后用 Wasserstein barycenter 融合奖励函数，得到更准确、可泛化的全局奖励；比传统参数平均更优且通信成本低。


<details>

Motivation: 多智能体在不同环境下协同执行任务，直接共享数据难求。动态差异、隐私与通信受限导致共享奖励学习困难。需要一种低通信量、尊重隐私且兼顾动态差异的全局奖励学习方法。

Method: 1）各客户端在本地执行轻量级最大熵逆强化学习；2）收集各客户端估计的奖励函数；3）利用 Wasserstein barycenter 对这些奖励函数进行几何结构上的加权平均，实现全局奖励合成；4）证明该融合方法优于普通平均。

Result: 证明通过 Wasserstein barycenter 进行奖励函数融合能得到比传统参数平均更具代表性的全局奖励估计，并展示了通信效率高、可在异构环境下泛化的优点。

Conclusion: 通过基于最优输运的 Wasserstein barycenter 进行奖励函数融合，可得到相较于传统参数平均更准确、可泛化的全局奖励估计；为异构无人机等多智能体系统提供通信效率高的联合逆向强化学习框架。

Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.

Result: 模型总体准确率78%，对多数类（Severity 2）精确率87%

Conclusion: 时段、地理位置和天气因素（可见度、温度、风速）为强预测因子，降水和可见度预测力有限，需优化采样、特征工程和外部数据集

Abstract: This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.

Motivation: 现有在线DT算法过度依赖监督式序列建模目标，并且后瞻回报重标与基于重要性采样的RL算法不兼容，导致训练不稳定，需要一种纯RL梯度的在线微调方案。

Method: 在GRPO框架下，去掉了后瞻回报重标（hindsight return relabeling），改为子轨迹优化、序列级似然目标以及主动采样机制，使得纯RL梯度适用于DT的在线训练。

Result: 通过在多项基准上的大量实验，方法在训练稳定性、效率和最终性能上均超过了所有现有在线DT基线，达到了新的state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: 本文提出了纯强化学习梯度下对决策变换器（Decision Transformers）进行在线微调的有效方法，并通过实验显著优于现有在线DT基线，刷新多项基准的最佳表现。

Abstract: Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision making by formulating offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.

Motivation: 应对非平稳奖励和高维策略空间下探索不足的问题，保留现有算法结构同时提升探索效率。

Method: 在传统策略梯度基础上，结合粒子群探索组件，生成候选轨迹并根据奖励方差自适应调整探索。

Result: 在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v3、Hopper-v4等环境上表现优异，提升幅度从0.7%到46%，在非平稳奖励下更是大幅超越PPO。

Conclusion: ARISE通过添加轻量的基于群体的探索层，改善了RL在复杂和不稳定奖励环境中的性能，且保持了算法的稳定性。

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.

Conclusion: Sequential RC在保持简洁高效的同时，实现了对高维动力系统的可扩展性，比传统 RC 更优越。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Objective: Develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting incident liver cirrhosis one, two, and three years prior to diagnosis using routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data, and to benchmark their performance against the FIB-4 score. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.

Abstract: Mosquitos are the main transmissive agents of arboviral diseases. Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level. The shifted-window transformer design proposed here beat all baselines by a wide margin and set new best marks in spike-based neuronal infection classification.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方案在IoMT边缘设备上计算量巨大，难以满足实时、低功耗监测需求；亟需参照资源约束的解决方案。

Method: 采用数据中心的轻量化方法，将时频小波分解与图论结构描述符（如PageRank中心性）结合，生成高维可线性可分特征空间，并通过互信息与递归剔除进一步优化；最终使用可解释性线性分类器实现推理。

Conclusion: 该框架以极低的模型体积与微秒级推理延迟实现了98.44%的心律失常诊断准确率，并相较于传统压缩模型显著提升了能源效率，推动了无电池心脏传感器的可行性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, remain a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating continuous monitoring via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $μ$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation. These outcomes provide an order-of-magnitude efficiency gain over compressed models, such as KD-Light (25 KB, 96.32% accuracy), advancing battery-less cardiac sensors.

Motivation: 手动标记EEG中事件耗时，尤其在长时间连续记录中更是难度大；自动标记可减轻人工负担。本研究针对缺席发作的典型波形SWD，探讨机器学习在标记上的表现与改进。

Method: 收集了961小时C3H/HeJ小鼠EEG数据，人工标注22,637个SWD；对1D UNet、13种传统ML分类器进行对比评估；通过数据增强包括缩放、裁剪、加噪等增强模型，评估其对1D UNet性能提升；将最佳改进模型AugUNet1D与“Twin Peaks”算法进行性能比较。

Result: 1D UNet在原始数据上已优于其他13个ML分类器；缩放式数据增强最显著提升模型性能；AugUNet1D在准确率、召回率和检测特征一致性上均优于Twin Peaks，且可在训练或未训练状态下使用。

Conclusion: 通过针对性的数据增强，1D UNet能够实现高精度的SWD自动标记，可有效减轻人工标注劳动，并可公开供他人使用。

Abstract: The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method has emerged as a dominant paradigm for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods usually exhibit significant vulnerability to various noise and attacks on graph topology and node attributes/features. To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks validate the robustness and effectiveness of AGP method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is the default way to adapt LLMs, but widely used LoRA and QLoRA are largely geometry-agnostic: they optimize in fixed, randomly oriented low-rank subspaces with first-order descent, mostly ignoring local loss curvature. This can inflate the effective update budget and amplify drift along weakly constrained directions. We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law. Empirically, GRIT yields lower drift and a better updates-vs-retention frontier than strong PEFT-optimizer baselines (Orthogonal-LoRA, IA3, DoRA, Eff-FT, Shampoo).

Motivation: 现有随机基准缺乏语义结构和可解释性，无法真实评估QAOA在现实问题中的表现，需引入结构化且可验证的量子基准。

Method: 基于棋子战术位置构建量子王环支配(QKRD)基准，生成5,000个5-40 qubit结构化实例；配合人类可解释的覆盖指标和经典启发式验证，系统评估QAOA不同设计选项。

Result: 约束保留混合器比标准快约13步，warm-start降低45步且能量提升超过8；CVaR方法负面结果；QAOA相较贪婪启发式高出12.6%、相较随机提高80.1%。

Conclusion: QAOA在结构化量子基准上显著优于传统随机实例，表明约束保留混合器及warm-start策略是提升性能的关键。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is extensively benchmarked on synthetic random instances such as MaxCut, TSP, and SAT problems, but these lack semantic structure and human interpretability, offering limited insight into performance on real-world problems with meaningful constraints. We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\% and random selection by 80.1\%. Our results demonstrate that structured benchmarks reveal advantages of problem-informed QAOA techniques obscured in random instances. We release all code, data, and experimental artifacts for reproducible NISQ algorithm research.

Conclusion: 本文验证了利用自动特征学习方法结合光流和三种深度模型能有效提高无人机视角下视频的人体检测精度，Pretrained CNN 最终取得最高平均准确率 98.09%。

Abstract: Human detection in videos plays an important role in various real-life applications. Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

Conclusion: E-GRPO通过提升SDE采样步骤的熵率以及合并低熵步骤来显著改善多步奖励稀疏问题，提升了流匹配模型在不同奖励设置下的对齐效果。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning has enhanced the flow matching models on human preference alignment. While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step. Experimental results on different reward settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.

Conclusion: 为实践者在解释性与预测性能之间的平衡提供切实指导，并深化了对表格数据可解释建模的经验认识

Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across a broad range of sectors, including high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.
  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.

Conclusion: TSFM可作为可扩展且高效的通用模型，适用于大规模时间序列异常检测。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is essential for the reliable operation of complex systems, but most existing methods require extensive task-specific training. We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CCBMs通过数学闭式近似实现无须完整重训练，可对概念标签、概念层与数据级进行编辑，保证CBM在动态环境中的可维护性与可信度。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our CCBMs, affirming their practical value in enabling dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.

Motivation: 阐明几何正则化在 MoE 专家化中的作用，探讨正交性约束的有效性

Method: 使用正交性损失约束专家多样性并评估其在权重空间和激活空间的重叠情况及性能变化

Result: 正交性损失导致权重空间重叠增加（最高 114%），激活空间重叠保持高（约 0.6），性能提升不显著或相反，并无显著相关性 (r=-0.293, p=0.523)

Conclusion: 权重空间正则化既未实现几何目标，也未可靠提升模型性能，不适用于 MoE 多样性

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficiency through sparse activation, but the role of geometric regularization in expert specialization remains unclear. We apply orthogonality loss to enforce expert diversity and find it fails on multiple fronts: it does not reduce weight-space overlap (MSO actually increases by up to 114%), activation-space overlap remains high (~0.6) regardless of regularization, and effects on performance are inconsistent -- marginal improvement on WikiText-103 (-0.9%), slight degradation on TinyStories (+0.9%), and highly variable results on PTB (std > 1.0). Our analysis across 7 regularization strengths reveals no significant correlation (r = -0.293, p = 0.523) between weight and activation orthogonality. These findings demonstrate that weight-space regularization neither achieves its geometric goal nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE diversity.

Abstract: We study multi-user contextual bandits where users are related by a graph and their reward functions exhibit both non-linear behavior and graph homophily. We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\{f_u\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear. Our work delivers a unified, theoretically grounded, and practical framework that bridges Laplacian regularization with kernelized bandits for structured exploration.

Abstract: We inspect the analogy between machine-learning (ML) applications based on the transformer architecture without self-attention, {\it neural chains} hereafter, and discrete dynamical systems associated with discretised versions of neural integral and partial differential equations (NIE, PDE). A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure. However, our results refer to one-dimensional dynamic problems, hence they don't rule out the possibility that PINNs and ML in general, may offer better strategies for high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Characterising the heterogeneous presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires integrating biological and clinical markers within a unified predictive framework. While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles. SAFN provides a reproducible and transparent multimodal modelling paradigm for computational profiling of neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Standard LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks provide accurate predictions for sales data in the retail industry, but require a lot of computing power. It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate. These results show that larger models do not always achieve better results.

Abstract: In this article, we explore federated customization of large models and highlight the key challenges it poses within the federated learning framework. We review several popular large model customization techniques, including full fine-tuning, efficient fine-tuning, prompt engineering, prefix-tuning, knowledge distillation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Then, we discuss how these techniques can be implemented within the federated learning framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on federated prefix-tuning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first trial to apply prefix-tuning in the federated learning setting. The conducted experiments validate its feasibility with performance close to centralized approaches. Further comparison with three other federated customization methods demonstrated its competitive performance, satisfactory efficiency, and consistent robustness.

Abstract: Planogram creation is a significant challenge for retail, requiring an average of 30 hours per complex layout. This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests. This work demonstrates the viability of generative AI for automated retail space optimization.

Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.

Abstract: Predicting cycling duration for a given route is essential for training planning and event preparation. Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts. Progressive checkpoint predictions enable dynamic race planning as route difficulty becomes apparent.

Result: 取得了最高水平的逼近保证：γ=1时0.401，γ<1时逐步下降且优于先前界限。

Conclusion: 在下闭凸体上最大化非负非单调γ-弱DR子模函数时，本文给出了一个逼近算法，其逼近因子随γ平滑变化，恢复了DR子模情况的0.401逼近，并在γ<1时优于此前结果。

Abstract: Maximizing submodular objectives under constraints is a fundamental problem in machine learning and optimization. We study the maximization of a nonnegative, non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular function over a down-closed convex body. Our main result is an approximation algorithm whose guarantee depends smoothly on $γ$; in particular, when $γ=1$ (the DR-submodular case) our bound recovers the $0.401$ approximation factor, while for $γ<1$ the guarantee degrades gracefully and, it improves upon previously reported bounds for $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization under the same constraints. Our approach combines a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a $γ$-aware double-greedy step, yielding a simple yet effective procedure for handling non-monotonicity. This results in state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization over down-closed convex bodies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini increasingly act as general-purpose copilots, yet they often respond with unnecessary length on simple requests, adding redundant explanations, hedging, or boilerplate that increases cognitive load and inflates token-based inference cost. Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.
  We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.
  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests. We release the benchmark and maintain a live leaderboard for tracking verbosity behavior over time.

Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis proves convergence properties and robustness to mini-batch noise, while empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.

Abstract: Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.

Motivation: 对广泛使用的配对生成式奖励模型（GRM）在与 RL 算法集成时导致的两大瓶颈：配对比较的 O(n²) 计算复杂度和反复采样或 CoT 推理的开销，亟需一种既保持解释性、细粒度奖励信号又能缩减计算成本的方法。

Method: 构建 Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO) 框架，在 GRPO 的基础上引入 Bradley‑Terry 模型，产生每条回应的点值评分；利用这些点值在 RL 训练期间高效评估任意数量的候选答案，从而避免重复采样和链式思维推理。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have attracted considerable research interest in reward modeling due to their interpretability, inference-time scalability, and potential for refinement through reinforcement learning (RL). However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.

Abstract: Ticket troubleshooting refers to the process of analyzing and resolving problems that are reported through a ticketing system. In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.

Conclusion: BSAT通过自适应B‑spline分割与L‑RoPE位置编码实现了在长序列预测中的高效压缩与竞争性能。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting using transformers is hampered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the rigidity of uniform patching, which may be misaligned with the data's semantic structure. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates. This makes it particularly well-suited for use cases with strong memory constraints.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loops: sampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring ones, mainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.

Conclusion: CDHMM与防守归属及反事实方法相结合，为评估足球离球防守提供了一条可解释、数据驱动的新路径，实现了防守绩效与进攻模型的互补。

Abstract: Evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football is challenging, as traditional metrics do not capture the nuanced coordinated movements that limit opponent action selection and success probabilities. Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating "average" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.

Conclusion: MBC 在持续学习中实现了极端压缩的内存金库，同时保持了对旧知识的高保留，展现了在资源受限场景下的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于扩散的柔性重参数化方法，用于处理分类变量的梯度优化，能够在保持无偏估计的同时降低噪声。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization with categorical variables typically relies on score-function estimators, which are unbiased but noisy, or on continuous relaxations that replace the discrete distribution with a smooth surrogate admitting a pathwise (reparameterized) gradient, at the cost of optimizing a biased, temperature-dependent objective. In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated data sharing promises utility without centralizing raw data, yet existing embedding-level generators struggle under non-IID client heterogeneity and provide limited formal protection against gradient leakage. We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions. After training, a neutral meta-code enables domain agnostic synthesis, while mixtures of meta-codes provide controllable multi-domain coverage. FedHypeVAE unifies personalization, privacy, and distribution alignment at the generator level, establishing a principled foundation for privacy-preserving data synthesis in federated settings.

Motivation: 在缺乏训练数据的情况下识别模型输出的数学推理真实性，解决 hallucination 与安全监测问题。

Method: 将注意力矩阵视为动态图的邻接矩阵，提取四个可解释的谱诊断指标（Fiedler值、高频能量比、图信号平滑度和谱熵），并对不同模型进行统计比较，使用单一阈值即可实现高准确率。

Result: 在七个 Transformer 模型上获得 Cohen's d 达到 3.30，分类准确率 85.0–95.6%，阈值校准后可达 93–95%。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了通过对注意力模式进行谱分析，可以在不需要训练的情况下高效区分大型语言模型生成的数学推理的有效性，提供了一种可解释且可迁移的验证框架。

Abstract: We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns. By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\text{MW}} = 1.16 \times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in low-altitude economy (LAE) applications, including UAV-based logistics and emergency response, fundamental challenges remain in orchestrating such missions over complex, signal-constrained environments. These include the absence of real-time, resilient, and context-aware orchestration of aerial nodes with limited integration of artificial intelligence (AI) specialized for LAE missions. This paper introduces an open radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled LAE framework that leverages seamless coordination between the disaggregated RAN architecture, open interfaces, and RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate closed-loop, AI-optimized, and mission-critical LAE operations. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes. We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs.

Conclusion: 概率感知停车策略能显著降低估计误差并在真实数据中实现高达66%的时间节省，但与直达目的地的估计相比仍显慢。

Abstract: Current parking navigation systems often underestimate total travel time by failing to account for the time spent searching for a parking space, which significantly affects user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates.

Abstract: Stability analysis of switched systems, characterized by multiple operational modes and switching signals, is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics. While frameworks such as multiple Lyapunov functions (MLF) provide a foundation for analysis, their computational applicability is limited for systems without favorable structure. This paper investigates stability analysis for switched systems under state-dependent switching conditions. We propose neural multiple Lyapunov functions (NMLF), a unified framework that combines the theoretical guarantees of MLF with the computational efficiency of neural Lyapunov functions (NLF). Our approach leverages a set of tailored loss functions and a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) scheme to train neural networks that rigorously satisfy MLF conditions. Through comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate NMLF's effectiveness and its potential for practical deployment in complex switched systems.

Abstract: Classic problem-space theory models problem solving as a navigation through a structured space of states, operators, goals, and constraints. Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the theory on practitioners and provides a dialogue-based hypothetical case study between a stakeholder and an engineer, demonstrating how the theory guides problem framing before designing any prescriptive artifacts.

Conclusion: 提出了一种能够处理单节点和特定多节点失效的分布式存储系统精确修复方案，扩展了Reed‑Solomon的应用范围至Reed‑Muller码。

Abstract: A distributed storage system stores data across multiple nodes, with the primary objective of enabling efficient data recovery even in the event of node failures. The main goal of an exact repair scheme is to recover the data from a failed node by accessing and downloading information from the rest of the nodes. In a groundbreaking paper, ~\cite{GW} developed an exact repair scheme for a distributed storage system that is based on Reed-Solomon codes, which depend on single-variable polynomials. In these notes, we extend the repair scheme to the family of distributed storage systems based on Reed-Muller codes, which are linear codes based on multivariate polynomials. The repair scheme we propose repairs any single node failure and multiple node failures, provided the positions satisfy certain conditions.

Abstract: Insufficient link budget has become a bottleneck problem for direct access in current satellite communications. In this paper, we develop a semantic transmission framework for direct satellite communications as an effective and viable solution to tackle this problem. To measure the tradeoffs between communication, computation, and generation quality, we introduce a semantic efficiency metric with optimized weights. The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher semantic efficiency than baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Universal outlier hypothesis testing refers to a hypothesis testing problem where one observes a large number of length-$n$ sequences -- the majority of which are distributed according to the typical distribution $π$ and a small number are distributed according to the outlier distribution $μ$ -- and one wishes to decide, which of these sequences are outliers without having knowledge of $π$ and $μ$. In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $π$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $π$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data present unique modeling challenges because recordings vary in length, exhibit very low signal to noise ratios, differ significantly across participants, drift over time within sessions, and are rarely available in large and clean datasets. Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) affects 11.8% of adults aged 65 and older, reducing quality of life and longevity. Preventing HF can reduce morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents. Explainability analysis showed DeepHHF focused on arrhythmias and heart abnormalities, with key attention between 8 AM and 3 PM. This study highlights the feasibility of deep learning to model 24-hour continuous ECG data, capturing paroxysmal events and circadian variations essential for reliable risk prediction. Artificial intelligence applied to single-lead Holter ECG is non-invasive, inexpensive, and widely accessible, making it a promising tool for HF risk prediction.

TL;DR: Using a probabilistic model of localization uncertainty, we formulate a joint power‑position problem and solve it with MAML. The method quickly adapts to new users and channels and yields much better reliability, secrecy and speed than baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combination of rapidly changing user placement and the need for physical‑layer security makes traditional optimization too slow; a real‑time, data‑driven approach is required.

Method: A probabilistic system model of user‑location uncertainty → joint antenna‑positioning and power optimization → MAML for a transferable initialization that allows few‑shot online adaptation.

Result: The proposed MAML‑based scheme outperforms Reptile meta‑learning, non‑meta reinforcement learning, conventional optimization, static placement and power‑only control in outage probability, secrecy, and convergence latency.

Conclusion: Meta‑learning can give secure, low‑latency real‑time control of pinching‑antenna systems in non‑stationary wireless environments.

Abstract: This paper develops a gradient-based meta-learning framework for real-time control of waveguided pinching-antenna systems under user-location uncertainty and physical-layer security (PLS) constraints. A probabilistic system model is introduced to capture the impact of imperfect localization on outage performance and secrecy. Based on this model, a joint antenna-positioning and transmit-power optimization problem is formulated to satisfy probabilistic reliability and secrecy requirements. To enable rapid adaptation in highly dynamic environments, the proposed approach employs model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn a transferable initialization across diverse mobility and channel conditions, allowing few-shot online adaptation using limited pilot feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms Reptile-based meta-learning, non-meta reinforcement learning, conventional optimization, static antenna placement, and power-only control in terms of outage probability, secrecy performance, and convergence latency. These results establish meta-learning as an effective tool for secure and low-latency control of reconfigurable pinching-antenna systems in non-stationary wireless environments.

Abstract: CSI extrapolation is an effective method for acquiring channel state information (CSI), essential for optimizing performance of sixth-generation (6G) communication systems. Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation. Key insights and takeaways from these methods are summarized. Given the promise of AI-driven methods in meeting performance requirements, we also examine the open-source channel datasets and simulators that could be used to train high-performance AI-driven CSI extrapolation models. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges of the existing research and propose perspective research opportunities.

Abstract: The impact of both multiplicative and additive hardware impairments (HWIs) on multiple-input multiple-output affine frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-AFDM) systems is investigated. For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.

TL;DR: Fast KLD maximization via fractional programming and relaxation reduces runtime by orders of magnitude, validated in random‑access and joint sensing‑communication applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximizing KLD for waveform design in active sensing and hypothesis testing is critical because it determines detection error exponents. However, the optimization is highly nonconvex and computationally intensive due to log‑determinant and trace coupling, causing existing solutions to require costly matrix inversions each iteration.

Method: Reformulate KLD maximization into a sequence of tractable quadratic sub‑problems via matrix fractional programming. Introduce a non‑homogeneous relaxation that replaces expensive linear‑system solving with a closed‑form update, reducing per‑iteration complexity to O(n^2). Use the STEM acceleration technique by interpreting the iterative scheme as a fixed‑point mapping to regain convergence speed.

Result: The proposed algorithm attains orders‑of‑magnitude faster total runtime than a state‑of‑the‑art benchmark while maintaining low per‑iteration cost. Numerical tests confirm the method’s effectiveness in multiple random‑access and joint integrated sensing‑and‑communication scenarios.

Conclusion: A computationally efficient fractional‑programming framework achieves fast, scalable KLD maximization, enabling practical waveform design for active sensing tasks.

Abstract: Maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is a fundamental problem in waveform design for active sensing and hypothesis testing, as it directly relates to the error exponent of detection probability. However, the associated optimization problem is highly nonconvex due to the intricate coupling of log-determinant and matrix trace terms. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, typically requiring matrix inversion at every iteration. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient optimization framework based on fractional programming (FP). Our key idea is to reformulate the KLD maximization problem into a sequence of tractable quadratic subproblems using matrix FP. To further reduce complexity, we introduce a nonhomogeneous relaxation technique that replaces the costly linear system solver with a simple closed-form update, thereby reducing the per-iteration complexity to quadratic order. To compensate for the convergence speed trade-off caused by relaxation, we employ an acceleration method called STEM by interpreting the iterative scheme as a fixed-point mapping. The resulting algorithm achieves significantly faster convergence rates with low per-iteration cost. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach reduces the total runtime by orders of magnitude compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to a multiple random access scenario and a joint integrated sensing and communication scenario, validating the efficacy of our framework in such applications.

Abstract: Limited fronthaul capacity is a practical bottleneck in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 5G architectures, where a base station (BS) consists of an advanced antenna system (AAS) connected to a baseband unit (BBU). Conventional downlink designs place the entire precoding computation at the BBU and transmit a high-dimensional precoding matrix over the fronthaul, resulting in substantial quantization losses and signaling overhead. This letter proposes a splitting precoding architecture that separates the design between the AAS and BBU. The AAS performs a local subspace selection to reduce the channel dimensionality, while the BBU computes an optimized quantized refinement precoding based on the resulting effective channel. The numerical results show that the proposed splitting precoding strategy achieves higher sum spectral efficiency than conventional one-stage precoding.

Abstract: Curved reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising frontier for next-generation wireless communication, enabling adaptive wavefront control on nonplanar platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles and urban infrastructure. This work presents a systematic investigation of cylindrical RISs, progressing from idealized surface-impedance synthesis to practical implementations based on simple one-bit meta-atoms. Exact analytical and geometrical-optics-based models are first developed to explore fundamental design limits, followed by a semi-analytical formulation tailored to discrete, reconfigurable architectures. This model enables efficient beam synthesis using both evolutionary optimization and low-complexity strategies, including the minimum power distortionless response method, and is validated through full-wave simulations. Results confirm that one-bit RISs can achieve directive scattering with manageable sidelobe levels and minimal hardware complexity. These findings establish the viability of cylindrical RISs and open the door to their integration into dual-use wireless platforms for real-world communication scenarios.

Abstract: This study considers a point-to-point wireless link, in which both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains.
