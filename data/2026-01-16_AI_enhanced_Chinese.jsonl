For fully-connected DMCs, we propose an achievable Stein-exponent and show that it can improve over the local exponent at the decision center.

In graph-based replication, the system consists of $K$ files replicated across $N$ servers according to a graph with $N$ vertices and $K$ edges. The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes.

While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving \"template-only\" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%. However, these gains largely reflect increased training exposure rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality. Corpus diagnostics revealed systematic synthetic-real mismatches in note length and label distribution that align with persistent leakage. We conclude that synthetic augmentation is effective for expanding exposure but is complementary, not substitutive, for safety-critical veterinary de-identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4f5c\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u8f7b\u5fae\u6539\u5584\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5f53\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u9002\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5b89\u5168\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u4e8c\u6b21\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6PetEVAL\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5f0f\u7684\u300c\u6a21\u677f\u552f\u8bfb\u300d\u5408\u6210\u75c5\u5386\uff0c\u5bf9PetEVAL\u884d\u751f\u8bed\u6599\uff083750\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u30011249\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u79cdTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff08PetBERT\u3001VetBERT\u3001Bio_ClinicalBERT\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7f6e\u6362\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u7387\u8d8a\u9ad8\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\u8d8a\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u5408\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u4e0e\u4ec5\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u5219\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u800c\u6309\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u589e\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u63d0\u5347PetBERT Span-overlap F1\u81f30.850\u5e76\u628a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\u964d\u81f34.02%\u3002\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6570\u6765\u81ea\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728\u6587\u672c\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6301\u7eed\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u66dd\u5149\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u52a8\u7269\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u8865\u5145\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u7eaf\u7f6e\u6362\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002"}}

While the capacities of PIR-SI under both $W$-privacy and $(W,S)$-privacy have been partially explored, the impact of controlled information leakage in these settings remains unaddressed. We propose a unified probabilistic framework to construct L-PIR-SI schemes where the privacy leakage is quantified by a parameter $\\varepsilon$, consistent with differential privacy standards. We characterize the achievable download costs and show that our results generalize several landmark results in the PIR literature: they recover the capacity of PIR-SI when $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, and reduce to the known bounds for leaky-PIR when side information is absent.

However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings.

However, these values are predictable and miner-manipulable, creating the Bad Randomness vulnerability (SWC-120) that has led to real-world exploits. Current detection tools identify only simple patterns and fail to verify whether protective modifiers actually guard vulnerable code. A major obstacle to improving these tools is the lack of large, accurately labeled datasets. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of 1,752 Ethereum smart contracts with validated Bad Randomness vulnerabilities. We developed a five-phase methodology comprising keyword filtering, pattern matching with 58 regular expressions, risk classification, function-level validation, and context analysis. The function-level validation revealed that 49% of contracts initially classified as protected were actually exploitable because modifiers were applied to different functions than those containing vulnerabilities. We classify contracts into four risk levels based on exploitability: HIGH_RISK (no protection), MEDIUM_RISK (miner-exploitable only), LOW_RISK (owner-exploitable only), and SAFE (using Chainlink VRF or commit-reveal). Our dataset is 51 times larger than RNVulDet and the first to provide function-level validation and risk stratification. Evaluation of Slither and Mythril revealed significant detection gaps, as both tools identified none of the vulnerable contracts in our sample, indicating limitations in handling complex randomness patterns.

Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large.

Submitted to IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "As wireless communication systems evolve toward the 6G era, ultra-massive/gigantic MIMO is envisioned as a key enabling technology. Recently, microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising approach to realize beamforming entirely in the analog domain, thereby alleviating the scalability challenges associated with gigantic MIMO. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental beamforming flexibility and design of lossless and reciprocal MiLAC-aided beamforming for MU-MISO systems. We first provide a rigorous characterization of the set of beamforming matrices achievable by MiLAC. Based on this characterization, we prove that MiLAC-aided beamforming does not generally achieve the full flexibility of digital beamforming, while offering greater flexibility than conventional phase-shifter-based analog beamforming. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid digital-MiLAC architecture and show that it achieves digital beamforming flexibility when the number of radio frequency (RF) chains equals the number of data streams, halving that required by conventional hybrid beamforming. We then formulate the MiLAC-aided sum-rate maximization problem for MU-MISO systems. To solve the problem efficiently, we reformulate the MiLAC-related constraints as a convex linear matrix inequality and establish a low-dimensional subspace property that significantly reduces the problem dimension. Leveraging these results, we propose WMMSE-based algorithms for solving the resulting problem. Simulation results demonstrate that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves performance close to that of digital beamforming in gigantic MIMO systems. Compared with hybrid beamforming, it achieves comparable or superior performance with lower hardware and computational complexity by avoiding symbol-level digital processing and enabling low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We specifically focus on backward reachability analysis, i.e., determining the set of states that can reach a given target set within a certain number of steps. Computing backward reachable sets presents significant challenges due to the non-convexity of max-plus dynamics and the complexity of set complement operations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approximation framework that efficiently computes backward reachable sets by exploiting the structure of tropical polyhedra. Our approach reformulates the problem as a sequence of symbolic operations and approximates non-convex target sets through closure operations on unions of tropical polyhedra. We develop a systematic algorithm that constructs both outer (M-form) and inner (V-form) representations of the resulting sets, incorporating extremal filtering to reduce computational complexity.

Physical layer security (PLS) exploits channel randomness and spatial selectivity to confine information to an intended receiver with modest overhead. However, typical PLS techniques, such as using beamforming, artificial noise, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, often involve added active power or specialized deployment, and, in many designs, rely on precise time synchronization and perfect CSI estimation, which limits their practicality. To this end, we propose AmbShield, an AmBD-assisted PLS scheme that leverages naturally distributed AmBDs to simultaneously strengthen the legitimate channel and degrade eavesdroppers' without requiring extra transmit power and with minimal deployment overhead. In AmbShield, AmBDs are exploited as friendly jammers that randomly backscatter to create interference at eavesdroppers, and as passive relays that backscatter the desired signal to enhance the capacity of legitimate devices. We further develop a unified analytical framework that analyzes the exact probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of legitimate and eavesdropper signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), and a closed-form secrecy outage probability (SOP). The analysis provides clear design guidelines on various practical system parameters to minimize SOP. Extensive experiments that include Monte Carlo simulations, theoretical derivations, and high-SNR asymptotic analysis demonstrate the security gains of AmbShield across diverse system parameters under imperfect synchronization and CSI estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Official version: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11340750 Code: https://github.com/jackwilkie/CLOSR", "summary": "Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u6076\u610f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u867d\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u4f46\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u6781\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u800c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u6b63\u5e38\u6d41\u91cf\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u6076\u610f\u6837\u672c\u5171\u540c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Lycos2017 \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7684 AUROC \u63d0\u5347\u4e86 0.000065\uff0c\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 0.060883\uff1b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cOpenAUC \u63d0\u5347 0.170883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we study optimal single-error correcting FCCs (SEFCCs) for maximally-unbalanced Boolean functions, where $k$ denotes the message length and $t$ denotes the error-correction capability. We analyze the structure of optimal SEFCC constructions through their associated codeword distance matrices and identify distinct FCC classes based on this structure. We then examine the impact of these structural differences on error performance by evaluating representative FCCs over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using both soft-decision and hard-decision decoding. The results show that FCCs with different distance-matrix structures can exhibit markedly different Data BER and function error behavior, and that the influence of code structure depends strongly on the decoding strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u529f\u80fd\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u6d88\u606f\u6062\u590d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u540cFCC\u7c7b\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027FCC\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u5224\u51b3\u548c\u786c\u5224\u51b3\u89e3\u7801\u6d4b\u8bc4\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u636e\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u7684FCC\u5728\u6570\u636eBER\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5355\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u529f\u80fd\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff08SEFCC\uff09\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

HyMGP is compared with HOMER Pro to evaluate its performance in optimizing the sizing of microgrid components, including photovoltaic panels (PVs), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), for remote and off-grid applications. The study focuses on a standalone microgrid in the Saudi Arabia, considering high solar irradiance, limited wind availability, and a constant load profile composed of continuous cathodic protection and daytime cooling. In the simulation environment, comparisons with HOMER solutions demonstrate the advantages of HyMGP, which provides optimal and more flexible solutions by allowing user-defined component specifications and strictly enforcing all constraints. Further analysis shows that incorporating wind turbines reduces the Net Present Cost (NPC) by decreasing the required PV and battery capacities. Increasing battery autonomy leads to a higher NPC in both PV-only and hybrid systems due to the need for larger storage. Finally, lithium iron phosphate (Li-ion LFP) batteries are found to be more cost effective than lead acid, offering lower NPCs due to their longer lifespan, deeper discharge capability, and fewer replacement cycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5e72\u65f1\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u5229\u7528MILP\u6a21\u578b\u7684HyMGP\u53ef\u4e3a\u79bb\u7f51\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7ad9\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u7ed9\u81ea\u8db3\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800cVIP\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5149\u70ed\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8377\u7279\u5f81\uff1b \uae30\uc874\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89c4\u683c\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\uff1b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u89c4\u5212\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212(MILP)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728HyMGP\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89c4\u683c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u4e0eHOMER\u202fPro\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u6848\u4f8b\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aHyMGP\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u98ce\u673a\u80fd\u964d\u4f4eNPC\uff0cLFP\u7535\u6c60\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "HyMGP\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5e72\u65f1\u5730\u533a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u66f4\u52a0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eNPC\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8f7d\u8377\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b"}}

A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, these new constructions can also offer circulant sizes asymptotically about 25% smaller than the novel bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528GCD\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u955c\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217/\u884c\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5217\u67437/8\u7684QC\u2011LDPC\u7801\uff0c\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u77ed\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u754c\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53ef\u538b\u7f2925%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u66f4\u77ed\u4e14\u884c\u6743\u5217\u6743\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684QC\u2011LDPC\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u7801\u957f\u4e0e\u5468\u671f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GCD\u4ee3\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u955c\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u884c\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u884c\u6743\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u6570\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u3002", "result": "\u5217\u67437\u30018\u7684QC\u2011LDPC\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0girth 8\u4e14\u5468\u671f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u754c\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620%\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7801\u957f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u754c\u5c0f\u7ea625%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7GCD\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u955c\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u53ca\u884c\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5217\u67437\u548c8\u7684QC\u2011LDPC\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u77ed\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5c0f\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff1b\u4e14\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620%\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u538b\u7f29\u7ea625%\u3002"}}

Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u7684LLM\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u901a\u8fc7M/G/1\u961f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5185\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u56de\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aM/G/1\u6392\u961f\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u57df\u5185\u4e25\u683c\u51f9\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\u63a8\u51fa\u6295\u5f71\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6574\u6570\u5316\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u961f\u5217\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u914d\u601d\u8003\u4ee4\u724c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210GPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u3001LoRA\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06LLM\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f2950%\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u83b7\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u5c5e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7GPTQ\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff1b 2) \u8fd0\u7528LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u79e9\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b 3) \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f + \u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\uff1b 4) \u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u53c2\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57286GB\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u81f33GB\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u7eafGPTQ\uff1bMu\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408GPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u3001LoRA\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1bMu\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728$d\\ge2k-2$\u65f6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u5b58\u50a8\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u2013\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u8282\u70b9\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5b58\u50a8\u518d\u751f\u6210\u70b9\uff08MSR\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5f53$d\\ge 2k-2$\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6743\u8861", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u533a\u95f4"}}

Superdirective behavior is achieved by leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling through careful adjustment of the strip dimensions. The antenna features a single driven element, with the other element passively loaded with a reactive impedance. The structure is optimized to maximize left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) realized gain, ensuring high polarization purity and good impedance matching. The optimized design exhibits a 50 $\u03a9$ impedance bandwidth of 3.29 - 4.17 GHz (23.75%) and an axial-ratio bandwidth of 3.43 - 3.57 GHz (4%). At 3.5 GHz, the antenna achieves a peak realized gain of 6.1 dB ($ka \\approx 1.65$), with an axial ratio of 1.4 dB.

While Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal protection, applying DP to conventional Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) often incurs substantial utility loss. In this work, we show that a more structurally constrained PEFT architecture, Tensor Train Low-Rank Adaptation (TTLoRA), can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by shrinking the effective parameter space while preserving expressivity. To this end, we develop TTLoRA-DP, a differentially private training framework for TTLoRA. Specifically, we extend the ghost clipping algorithm to Tensor Train cores via cached contraction states, enabling efficient Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) with exact per-example gradient norm computation without materializing full per-example gradients. Experiments on GPT-2 fine-tuning over the Enron and Penn Treebank datasets show that TTLoRA-DP consistently strengthens privacy protection relative to LoRA-DP while maintaining comparable or better downstream utility. Moreover, TTLoRA exhibits lower membership leakage even without DP training, using substantially smaller adapters and requiring on average 7.6X fewer parameters than LoRA.

We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To obtain these metrics, training signals such as pilot sequences are generally employed. However, the rapid fluctuations of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) propagation channel often degrade the accuracy of such estimations. To address this challenge, various blind estimators that operate without pilot have been considered as potential solutions. However, these algorithms often involve a training phase for machine learning or a large number of iterations, which implies prohibitive computational complexity, making them difficult to employ for real-time services and the system less resilient to dynamic environment variation. In this paper, we propose blind estimators for average noise power, signal power, SNR, and mean-square error (MSE) that do not require knowledge of the ground-truth signal or involve high computational complexity. The proposed algorithm leverages the inherent sparsity of mmWave channel in beamspace domain, which makes the signal and noise power components more distinguishable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles.

While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

This paper expands on the previous work on Sudoku-based encryption methods, applying it to other forms of media including images, audio and video. It also enhances the security of key generation and usage by making it dependent on the timestamp of when the message was transmitted. It is a versatile system that works on multimodal data and functions as a block-based transposition cipher. Instead of shuffling, it can also employ substitution methods like XOR, making it a substitution cipher. The resulting media are highly encrypted and resilient to brute-force and differential attacks. For images, NPCR values approach 100% and for audio, SNR values exceed 60dB.

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability.

We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise.

We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants.

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9XL\u2011MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u5206\u5e03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u5ea6\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddd\u79bb\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u53cd\u9988\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6781\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\uff08XL\u2011MIMO\uff09\u9891\u5206\u53cc\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u6781\u89d2\u57df\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff09\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u9988\u91cf\u8fc7\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6781\u89d2\u533a\u57df\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u62bd\u6837\u4e0e\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6c42\u548c\u901f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7Voronoi\u5206\u5272\u8bc1\u660e\u89d2\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u5747\u5300\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u91c7\u6837\u5229\u7528\u4e0b\u754c\u5f0f\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53cd\u9988\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u968f\u9635\u5217\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u901f\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u6781\u89d2\u57df\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u5206\u5e03\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9635\u5217\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u89d2\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6bd4\u7279\u6bd4\u7387\u3002"}}

To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

This exposed metadata leaks rich structural information, such as stack layouts, control-flow boundaries, and object lifetimes, which can be exploited to facilitate reverse engineering. In this paper, we present XuanJia, a comprehensive VM-based binary obfuscation framework that provides end-to-end protection for both executable code and exception-handling semantics. At the core of XuanJia is ABI-Compliant EH Shadowing, a novel exception-aware protection mechanism that preserves compatibility with unmodified operating system runtimes while eliminating static EH metadata leakage. XuanJia replaces native EH metadata with ABI-compliant shadow unwind information to satisfy OS-driven unwinding, and securely redirects exception handling into a protected virtual machine where the genuine EH semantics are decrypted, reversed, and replayed using obfuscated code. We implement XuanJia from scratch, supporting 385 x86 instruction encodings and 155 VM handler templates, and design it as an extensible research testbed. We evaluate XuanJia across correctness, resilience, and performance dimensions.

Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165 L\u2011HSDP \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u5206\u5757\u6570 MISO \u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b50\u5305\u6570\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u540c\u9636\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8 sum\u2011DoF\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u5728 L\u3001M\u3001N \u4efb\u610f\u53d6\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b50\u5305\u6570\u968f\u7528\u6237\u6570\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff1b\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8 sum\u2011DoF \u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u5757\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5c06 MAPDA \u4e2d F=K \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a L\u2011Half\u2011Sum Disjoint Packing\uff08HSDP\uff09\u7684\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u62c9\u4e01\u65b9\u6846\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u7b51 L\u2011HSDP\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u7f16\u7801\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u5355\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9012\u9001\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7 L\u2011HSDP \u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0 F=K \u7684\u5b50\u5305\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728 sum\u2011DoF \u4e0a\u53ea\u7565\u6709\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5374\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u5728 sum\u2011DoF \u4e0e\u5b50\u5305\u6570\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5206\u5757\u6570\u7684 MISO \u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020 L\u2011HSDP \u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684 sum\u2011DoF\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5b50\u5305\u6570\u4ece\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u9636\u68af\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that this perspective is incomplete and highlight a critical vulnerability in Reasoning Alignment. We propose a new adversarial paradigm: Reasoning Hijacking and instantiate it with Criteria Attack, which subverts model judgments by injecting spurious decision criteria without altering the high-level task goal. Unlike Goal Hijacking, which attempts to override the system prompt, Reasoning Hijacking accepts the high-level goal but manipulates the model's decision-making logic by injecting spurious reasoning shortcut. Though extensive experiments on three different tasks (toxic comment, negative review, and spam detection), we demonstrate that even newest models are prone to prioritize injected heuristic shortcuts over rigorous semantic analysis. The results are consistent over different backbones. Crucially, because the model's \"intent\" remains aligned with the user's instructions, these attacks can bypass defenses designed to detect goal deviation (e.g., SecAlign, StruQ), exposing a fundamental blind spot in the current safety landscape.

Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally.

Recent algebraic results express the contribution of individual bit-channels to the multiplicities of minimum and near-minimum weight codewords in closed form. In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity.

Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6ODE\u5757\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u6539\u9020Transformer\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTransformer \u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5c42\u6df1\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6Neural ODE\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u5c42\u6df1\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a$F_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)$\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7$u$\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c5e\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u9644\u5e26\u7684\u4f34\u968f\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u96f6\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8/\u6d88\u5931\u4e14\u5185\u5b58O(1)\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u7206\u70b8/\u6d88\u5931\uff1b2\uff09\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\u51c6\u786e\u738798\\%/88%\uff1b3\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u63d2\u503c\u79bb\u6563\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ec50.068\\%\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\uff1b4\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u6df1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6df7\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u5f53\u3002"}}

The functionality, while impossible using classical information alone, can be achieved using quantum information. Existing approaches, rely on one-time pad (OTP) encryption, or use computational hardness assumptions that may be vulnerable to future advances in classical or quantum computing. In this work, we introduce and formalize hybrid encryption with certified deletion in the preprocessing model (pHE-CD) and propose two constructions. The constructions combine an information-theoretic key encapsulation mechanism (iKEM) with a data encapsulation mechanism that provides certified deletion (DEM-CD) and, respectively, provide {\\em information-theoretic certified deletion}, where both confidentiality and deletion properties are provided against a computationally unbounded adversary; and {\\em everlasting certified deletion}, where confidentiality is computational before deletion, and upon successful verification of the deletion certificate, the message becomes information-theoretically hidden from an adversary that is computationally unbounded. Our pHE-CD schemes provide IND-$q_e$-CPA notion of security and support encryption of arbitrarily long messages. In the second construction, using a computationally secure DEM-CD that is quantum-safe (i.e. constructed using quantum coding and AES), we obtain quantum-safe security with keys that are significantly shorter than the message.

Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \\textit{et al.} are layered.

Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines.

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings.

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions.

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria.

The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme.

However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance.

At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes.

As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users.

However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations.

In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs.

Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $\u0394$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $\u0394$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse. We also characterize the performance of the scheme in the finite field using another converse based on counting arguments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u57df\u5747\u7ed9\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u754c\u4e0e\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6848\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u7528\u6237\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5230\u7528\u6237\u7684\u603b\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528M\u4e2a\u5b50\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u0394\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610fK\u3001L\u3001M\u3001\u0394\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u57df\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0e\u65e2\u6709\u4e0b\u754c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\uff08converse\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u591a\u7528\u6237\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff08K,\u202fL,\u202fM,\u202f\u0394\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0b\u4ea6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002"}}

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers.

We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u6e90-\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u7801\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5e7f\u64ad\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u987b\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5931\u771f\u7ea6\u675f\u5185\u6062\u590d\u6e90\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4e00\u7801\u672c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u901a\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Poisson\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u7406\u7684\u6539\u9020\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u7801\u672c\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u53ef\u8fbe\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u7ec4\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u7ec4\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7801\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7801\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6e90-\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7801\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u7801\u672c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u7ec4\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5171\u4eab\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRL\u901a\u8fc7\u628a\u7ec8\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316RL\u516c\u5f0f\uff08\u5305\u542bKL\u60e9\u7f5a\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b80\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7ec8\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u989d\u5916\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProcess Reward Learning\uff08PRL\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u62c6\u5206\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5f97\u5230\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316+KL\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ec8\u7aef\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fc7\u6e21\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u989d\u5916MCTS\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePRL\u5728\u5e73\u5747@n\u548cpass@n\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PRL\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension.

SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients.

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures.

(2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments.

Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient.

Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments.

The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression.

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs.

An enhanced version was accepted for oral presentation at the AI for Time Series Analysis Workshop at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition.

This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\u00f6s-Renyi and scale-free Barab\u00e1si-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u8c03\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec32\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u795e\u7ecf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u529f\u7387\u5f8b\uff1b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5355\u8c03\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u53ef\u7528\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u66f2\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u2014\u2014\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u7531\u6570\u636e\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u9a8c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u68c0\u9a8c\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53ef\u8c03\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u53cc\u5b57\u8fb9\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff084\u21922\u21921\u5c42\uff09\u53ca\u5927\u7eb2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u5728Erd\u00f6s-Renyi\u548cBarab\u00e1si-Albert\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u518d\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u66f2\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1. \u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u65e0\u529f\u7387\u5f8b\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u30022. \u968f\u673a\u56fe\uff08Erd\u00f6s-Renyi\u3001Barab\u00e1si-Albert\uff09\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u671f\u30023. \u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u5355\u8c03\u964d\u4f4e\u30024. 2\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u66f2\u7ebf\u30025. \u6700\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u529f\u7387\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u5448\u5355\u8c03\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e2\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u66f2\u7ebf\u53ca\u6700\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available.

We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy.

In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \\emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \\emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9636\u903c\u8fd1+\u70b9\u79ef\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u83b7\u53d6\u8fd1\u4f3cscore\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u76f8\u5173", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ecd\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e9f\u5f85\u6539\u8fdb", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9636\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0e\u70b9\u79ef\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4ec5\u9700\u8fd1\u4f3cscore\u7684\u60c5\u5f62", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u53d7\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6709\u6548\u534a\u5f84\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u4fdd\u8bc1", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f31\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848"}}

Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.", "AI": {"tldr": "DInf-Grid \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u5bfc\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u79d2\u5230\u5206\u949f\u5185\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3 PDE\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf MLP \u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb 5\u201120 \u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5750\u6807\u57fa MLP \u8f83\u6162\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff1b\u7f51\u683c\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5feb\u4f46\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u9636\u5fae\u5206\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728 DE \u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u5bfc\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u7684\u6355\u6349\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "DInf-Grid \u5728 Poisson\u3001Helmholtz\u3001Kirchhoff\u2010Love \u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 5\u201120 \u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5206\u949f\u964d\u81f3\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e MLP \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DInf-Grid \u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u683c\u4e0e RBF \u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9636\u5fae\u5206\uff08\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u5bfc\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6c42\u89e3\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u51c6 PDE \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}
