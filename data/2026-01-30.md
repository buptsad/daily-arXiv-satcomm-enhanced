Conclusion: HT-MIA通过在低置信度单词上捕获token级概率差异，显著提升了LLM的会员推理攻击效果，并为使用差分隐私防御提出有效性评估。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and increasingly stringent privacy regulations, protecting data privacy in LLMs has become essential, especially for privacy-sensitive applications. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) attempt to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the model training/fine-tuning dataset, posing serious privacy risks. However, most existing MIA techniques against LLMs rely on sequence-level aggregated prediction statistics, which fail to distinguish prediction improvements caused by generalization from those caused by memorization, leading to low attack effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a novel membership inference approach that captures the token-level probabilities for low-confidence (hard) tokens, where membership signals are more pronounced. By comparing token-level probability improvements at hard tokens between a fine-tuned target model and a pre-trained reference model, HT-MIA isolates strong and robust membership signals that are obscured by prior MIA approaches. Extensive experiments on both domain-specific medical datasets and general-purpose benchmarks demonstrate that HT-MIA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art MIA baselines. We further investigate differentially private training as an effective defense mechanism against MIAs in LLMs. Overall, our HT-MIA framework establishes hard-token based analysis as a state-of-the-art foundation for advancing membership inference attacks and defenses for LLMs.

Abstract: With LLMs increasingly deployed in corporate data management, it is crucial to ensure that these models do not leak sensitive information. In the context of corporate data management, the concept of sensitivity awareness has been introduced, enabling LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. However, it remains unclear how sensitivity awareness relates to established notions of privacy, such as differential privacy (DP), thereby making it difficult to deploy meaningfully in real-world applications. In this work, we formalize the notion of sensitivity awareness and theoretically establish its connection to DP. Additionally, we develop a supervised fine-tuning recipe to make existing, four-bit quantized LLMs more sensitivity-aware. With a performance boost of up to 21.7%, the finetuned LLMs not only substantially improve over their baseline but also outperform other full-precision open-source and commercial models of similar size in achieving sensitivity awareness, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. At the same time, our method also largely preserves the models' performance on other tasks, such as general instruction-following, mathematical, and common-sense reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks have emerged as a critical threat to Large Language Models (LLMs), bypassing safety mechanisms by progressively constructing adversarial contexts from scratch and incrementally refining prompts. However, existing methods suffer from the inefficiency of incremental context construction that requires step-by-step LLM interaction, and often stagnate in suboptimal regions due to surface-level optimization. In this paper, we characterize the Intent-Context Coupling phenomenon, revealing that LLM safety constraints are significantly relaxed when a malicious intent is coupled with a semantically congruent context pattern. Driven by this insight, we propose ICON, an automated multi-turn jailbreak framework that efficiently constructs an authoritative-style context via prior-guided semantic routing. Specifically, ICON first routes the malicious intent to a congruent context pattern (e.g., Scientific Research) and instantiates it into an attack prompt sequence. This sequence progressively builds the authoritative-style context and ultimately elicits prohibited content. In addition, ICON incorporates a Hierarchical Optimization Strategy that combines local prompt refinement with global context switching, preventing the attack from stagnating in ineffective contexts. Experimental results across eight SOTA LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of ICON, achieving a state-of-the-art average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 97.1\%.

### [4] [Robust Federated Learning for Malicious Clients using Loss Trend Deviation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20915)
*Deepthy K Bhaskar,Minimol B,Binu V P*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FL-LTD 用损失曲线监测而非梯度，轻量化防御联邦学习，显著提升对恶意攻击的鲁棒性，效果优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度或类似度的防御产生额外开销，且在非IID场景不稳；需要更简洁、低成本、对数据分布友好的安全方案。

Method: 利用损失曲线的异常（停滞或波动）来识别恶意客户端，并加入短期记忆机制以持续抑制已标记客户，支持稳定参与方恢复信任。

Result: 在非IID MNIST 数据上，FL-LTD 在损失操纵攻击下最终测试准确率为0.84，远高于受攻击的标准FedAvg仅0.41；同时几乎无计算与通信开销。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种轻量、隐私友好的联邦学习安全框架FL-LTD，通过监测损失走势检测并抑制恶意客户端，实现了安全稳健的联邦训练。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training among distributed clients while ensuring that raw data remains on local devices.Despite this advantage, FL systems are still exposed to risks from malicious or unreliable participants. Such clients can interfere with the training process by sending misleading updates, which can negatively affect the performance and reliability of the global model. Many existing defense mechanisms rely on gradient inspection, complex similarity computations, or cryptographic operations, which introduce additional overhead and may become unstable under non-IID data distributions. In this paper, we propose the Federated Learning with Loss Trend Detection (FL-LTD), a lightweight and privacy-preserving defense framework that detects and mitigates malicious behavior by monitoring temporal loss dynamics rather than model gradients. The proposed approach identifies anomalous clients by detecting abnormal loss stagnation or abrupt loss fluctuations across communication rounds. To counter adaptive attackers, a short-term memory mechanism is incorporated to sustain mitigation for clients previously flagged as anomalous, while enabling trust recovery for stable participants. We evaluate FL-LTD on a non-IID federated MNIST setup under loss manipulation attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances robustness, achieving a final test accuracy of 0.84, compared to 0.41 for standard FedAvg under attack. FL-LTD incurs negligible computational and communication overhead, maintains stable convergence, and avoids client exclusion or access to sensitive data, highlighting the effectiveness of loss-based monitoring for secure federated learning.

### [5] [FIPS 204-Compatible Threshold ML-DSA via Masked Lagrange Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20917)
*Leo Kao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Masked Lagrange Reconstruction给出任意阈值T的Threshold ML‑DSA，兼容标准签名，解决系数增长、key‑recovery、nonce分布三难题；通过TEE、MPC、2PC三种部署模式分别实现3、8、3–5轮签名，安全性稳健且性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要多数诚实方、耗时数十轮，要么仅限T≤6；此外在阈值T下Lagrange系数随Θ(q)增长，导致ML‑DSA拒绝采样无法收敛，亟需一种兼容标准、支持任意T的新方案。

Method: 采用Masked Lagrange Reconstruction，解决ML‑DSA在阈值T下系数增长导致拒绝采样失败、r0检查泄露密钥、Irwin‑Hall随机数分布破坏安全等三大挑战；结合TEE、MPC或2PC实现三种协议，利用Module‑SIS和UC安全框架进行证明。

Result: 构造了支持|S|≥T+1的Threshold ML‑DSA，标准3.3KB签名，P1实现3轮签名、P2 8轮、P3 3-5轮，安全性依赖Module‑SIS和UC；成功率为23–32%，与单签名ML‑DSA相当，P3在实验中耗时249ms。

Conclusion: 提出了一种Masked Lagrange Reconstruction技术，实现任意阈值T的Threshold ML-DSA，生成标准3.3KB签名，兼容未改动的FIPS 204实现；在三种部署模式下提供完整安全性证明，分别支持TEE辅助（3轮签名）、完全分布式MPC（8轮）和轻量级2PC（3-5轮），均达EUF‑CMA/UC安全。

Abstract: We present masked Lagrange reconstruction, a technique that enables threshold ML-DSA (FIPS 204) with arbitrary thresholds $T$ while producing standard 3.3 KB signatures verifiable by unmodified FIPS 204 implementations. Concurrent approaches have limitations: Bienstock et al. (ePrint 2025/1163) achieve arbitrary $T$ but require honest-majority and 37--136 rounds; Celi et al. (ePrint 2026/013) achieve dishonest-majority but are limited to $T \leq 6$. Our technique addresses the barrier that Lagrange coefficients grow as $Θ(q)$ for moderate $T$, making individual contributions too large for ML-DSA's rejection sampling.
  Unlike ECDSA threshold schemes where pairwise masks suffice for correctness, ML-DSA requires solving three additional challenges absent in prior work: (1) rejection sampling on $\|z\|_\infty$ must still pass after masking, (2) the $r_0$-check exposes $c s_2$ enabling key recovery if unprotected, and (3) the resulting Irwin-Hall nonce distribution must preserve EUF-CMA security. We solve all three.
  We instantiate this technique in three deployment profiles with full security proofs. Profile P1 (TEE-assisted) achieves 3-round signing with a trusted coordinator, with EUF-CMA security under Module-SIS. Profile P2 (fully distributed) eliminates hardware trust via MPC in 8 rounds, achieving UC security against malicious adversaries corrupting up to $n-1$ parties. Profile P3 (2PC-assisted) uses lightweight 2PC for the $r_0$-check in 3--5 rounds, achieving UC security under a 1-of-2 CP honest assumption with the best empirical performance (249ms).
  Our scheme requires $|S| \geq T+1$ signers and achieves success rates of 23--32\%, matching single-signer ML-DSA.

TL;DR: 阐述149品牌对骚扰短信信息的教育不足，并给出标准化改进方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解品牌如何向客户普及短信钓鱼意识

Method: 对149个知名品牌在25类中进行内容分析

Result: 发现缺口：仅46%说明定义，<1%提供视频教程，50%给出举报指导；术语、预防建议、举报机制差异大，部分建议效果差

Conclusion: 为行业确定钓鱼预防现状并提出统一化建议，以提升客户安全感

Abstract: Phishing attacks through text, also known as smishing, are a prevalent type of social engineering tactic in which attackers impersonate brands to deceive victims into providing personal information and/or money. While smishing awareness and cyber education are a key method by which organizations communicate this awareness, the guidance itself varies widely. In this paper, we investigate the state of practice of how 149 well-known brands across 25 categories educate their customers about smishing and what smishing prevention and reporting advice they provide. After conducting a comprehensive content analysis of the brands, we identified significant gaps in the smishing-related information provided: only 46\% of the 149 brands mentioned the definition of smishing, less than 1\% had a video tutorial on smishing, and only 50\% of brands provided instructions on how to report. Our study highlights variation in terminology, prevention advice, and reporting mechanisms across industries, with some brands recommending potentially ineffective strategies such as "ignoring suspicious messages." These findings establish a baseline for understanding the current state of industry smishing awareness advice and provide specific areas where standardization improvements are needed. From our evaluation, we provide recommendations for brands on how to offer streamlined education to their respective customers on smishing for better awareness and protection against increasing smishing attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 利用动态地址位随机化阻止投机错误；误差率降至0.0004%，性能提升约2%，面积0.064 mm²，功耗5.9 mW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御主要针对投机数据泄露，忽视了从部分地址别名导致的假依赖问题，SPOILER攻击利用此缺陷通过重复打断和重发事件放大加载-存储延迟。

Method: 设计并实现硬件防御SPOILER‑GUARD，通过动态随机化用于加载-存储比较的物理地址位，并给存储条目打标，以阻止延迟放大的错跃投机。

Result: 在gem5实验与SPEC 2017上，SPOILER‑GUARD将错跃率降至0.0004%，整数和浮点性能分别提升2.12%与2.87%。在14 nm芯片合成中，对关键路径时延69 ps、面积0.064 mm²、功耗5.863 mW的增量极小。

Conclusion: SPOILER‑GUARD成功抑制了因地址别名导致的投机错误，显著增强系统安全性，并且对性能和硬件开销影响极小。

Abstract: Modern microprocessors depend on speculative execution, creating vulnerabilities that enable transient execution attacks. Prior defenses target speculative data leakage but overlook false dependencies from partial address aliasing, where repeated squash and reissue events increase the load-store latency, which is exploited by the SPOILER attack. We present SPOILER-GUARD, a hardware defense that obfuscates speculative dependency resolution by dynamically randomizing the physical address bits used for load-store comparisons and tagging store entries to prevent latency-amplifying misspeculations. Implemented in gem5 and evaluated with SPEC 2017, SPOILER-GUARD reduces misspeculation to 0.0004 percent and improves integer and floating-point performance by 2.12 and 2.87 percent. HDL synthesis with Synopsys Design Compiler at 14 nm node demonstrates minimal overheads - 69 ps latency in critical path, 0.064 square millimeter in area, and 5.863 mW in power.

TL;DR: TrajPrint利用路径追踪与指纹噪声生成，实现了无训练、无损、对抗模型修改的黑盒API版权验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为高价值IP，易被未经授权复制；现有嵌入式水印或指纹提取方法要么损害性能，要么不兼容黑盒接口，亟需全新的无损验证方案。

Method: 利用水印图像作为锚点，精准追踪其生成路径锁定模型特征，再通过双端锚定联合优化生成符合目标流形的指纹噪声，实现对目标模型的准确水印复原。

Result: 通过原子推理与统计假设检验，TrajPrint在黑盒API中实现了完全无损的版权验证，且对模型修改表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TrajPrint能在黑盒API场景下完成无损、无训练的模型版权验证，并对模型改动保持优异鲁棒性。

Abstract: The exceptional performance of diffusion models establishes them as high-value intellectual property but exposes them to unauthorized replication. Existing protection methods either modify the model to embed watermarks, which impairs performance, or extract model fingerprints by manipulating the denoising process, rendering them incompatible with black-box APIs. In this paper, we propose TrajPrint, a completely lossless and training-free framework that verifies model copyright by extracting unique manifold fingerprints formed during deterministic generation. Specifically, we first utilize a watermarked image as an anchor and exactly trace the path back to its trajectory origin, effectively locking the model fingerprint mapped by this path. Subsequently, we implement a joint optimization strategy that employs dual-end anchoring to synthesize a specific fingerprint noise, which strictly adheres to the target manifold for robust watermark recovery. As input, it enables the protected target model to recover the watermarked image, while failing on non-target models. Finally, we achieved verification via atomic inference and statistical hypothesis testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajPrint achieves lossless verification in black-box API scenarios with superior robustness against model modifications.

Method: 通过对该地区银行应用的实证评测，分析其易受FjordPhantom攻击的脆弱性，并评估现有防护措施的有效性。

Result: 发现多数受评测银行应用对恶意可访问服务的检测不足，导致FjordPhantom能够成功安装二次恶意组件并收集关键信息。

Conclusion: 本研究指出，FjordPhantom利用虚拟化和Hook技术规避检测，导致东南亚地区银行应用易受攻击，建议强化访问服务审计与权限校验，并制定针对多级恶意组件的防御机制。

Abstract: Android banking applications have revolutionized financial management by allowing users to perform various financial activities through mobile devices. However, this convenience has attracted cybercriminals who exploit security vulnerabilities to access sensitive financial data. FjordPhantom, a malware identified by our industry collaborator, uses virtualization and hooking to bypass the detection of malicious accessibility services, allowing it to conduct keylogging, screen scraping, and unauthorized data access. This malware primarily affects banking and finance apps across East and Southeast Asia region where our industry partner's clients are primarily based in. It requires users to be deceived into installing a secondary malicious component and activating a malicious accessibility service. In our study, we conducted an empirical study on the susceptibility of banking apps in the region to FjordPhantom, analyzed the effectiveness of protective measures currently implemented in those apps, and discussed ways to detect and prevent such attacks by identifying and mitigating the vulnerabilities exploited by this malware.

Proposed implementation of lightweight authenticated encryption offers strong security without sacrificing performance in resource-constrained environments. It produces fixed-length messages, maintaining compatibility with the underlying data transport protocols. By focusing on predictable properties and robust authentication, we create a scheme that protects the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of telemetry data in emergency communications while balancing security requirements with the operational constraints.

Abstract: The escalating sophistication of phishing emails necessitates a shift beyond traditional rule-based and conventional machine-learning-based detectors. Although large language models (LLMs) offer strong natural language understanding, using them as standalone classifiers often yields elevated falsepositive (FP) rates, which mislabel legitimate emails as phishing and create significant operational burden. This paper presents a personalized phishing detection framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For each message, the system constructs user-specific context by retrieving a compact set of the user's historical legitimate emails and enriching it with real-time domain and URL reputation from a cyber-threat intelligence platform, then conditions the LLM's decision on this evidence. We evaluate four open-source LLMs (Llama4-Scout, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral-Saba, and Gemma2) on an email dataset collected from public and institutional sources. Results show high performance; for example, Llama4-Scout attains an F1-score of 0.9703 and achieves a 66.7% reduction in FPs with RAG. These findings validate that a RAG-based, user-profiling approach is both feasible and effective for building high-precision, low-friction email security systems that adapt to individual communication patterns.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving deep learning addresses privacy concerns in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) by using Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for linear computations. However, the computational overhead remains a major challenge. While prior work has improved efficiency, most approaches build on models originally designed for plaintext inference. Such models incur architectural inefficiencies when adapted to HE. We argue that substantial gains require networks tailored to HE rather than retrofitting plaintext architectures. Our design has two components: the building block and the overall architecture. First, StriaBlock targets the most expensive HE operation, rotation. It integrates ExRot-Free Convolution and a novel Cross Kernel, eliminating external rotations and requiring only 19% of the internal rotations used by plaintext models. Second, our architectural principles include (i) the Focused Constraint Principle, which limits cost-sensitive factors while preserving flexibility elsewhere, and (ii) the Channel Packing-Aware Scaling Principle, which adapts bottleneck ratios to ciphertext channel capacity that varies with depth. Together, these strategies control both local and end-to-end HE cost, enabling a balanced HE-tailored network. We evaluate the resulting StriaNet across datasets of varying scales, including ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-10. At comparable accuracy, StriaNet achieves speedups of 9.78x, 6.01x, and 9.24x on ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-10, respectively.

TL;DR: SecIC3是用于硬件信息流/非干扰检查的定制IC3模型检查器。它利用自组合结构的对称性和等价谓词技术，显著加速证明过程，实验显示最高可比基线快 49.3 倍。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬件信息流检查通过自组合将非干扰属性转换为安全属性，但自组合设计体积大导致模型检查耗时；现有模型检查器未针对其特殊结构优化，亟需改进以满足实用需求。

Method: 在标准 IC3 算法上定制两种技术：1）在自组合结构的两份设计上进行对称状态探索，避免不必要的状态扩展；2）添加 equivalence predicates 以加速不相交证明的收敛。实现基于两套开源 IC3，整合至 SecIC3。

Result: 在包含10个设计的非干扰基准上，SecIC3 将证明耗时显著缩短，最高实现 49.3 倍的加速；整体性能大幅优于两款开源 IC3 基线实现。

Conclusion: SecIC3 通过利用自组合结构（Symmetric State Exploration 和 Equivalence Predicates）显著提升了硬件安全属性（信息流/非干扰）的模型检查效率；在基准实验中，相比基线实现，证明速度提升最多可达 49.3 倍。

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances in using formal verification to check hardware security properties. Of particular practical interest are checking confidentiality and integrity of secrets, by checking that there is no information flow between the secrets and observable outputs. A standard method for checking information flow is to translate the corresponding non-interference hyperproperty into a safety property on a self-composition of the design, which has two copies of the design composed together. Although prior efforts have aimed to reduce the size of the self-composed design, there are no state-of-the-art model checkers that exploit their special structure for hardware security verification. In this paper, we propose SecIC3, a hardware model checking algorithm based on IC3 that is customized to exploit this self-composition structure. SecIC3 utilizes this structure in two complementary techniques: symmetric state exploration and adding equivalence predicates. We implement SecIC3 on top of two open-source IC3 implementations and evaluate it on a non-interference checking benchmark consisting of 10 designs. The experiment results show that SecIC3 significantly reduces the time for finding security proofs, with up to 49.3x proof speedup compared to baseline implementations.

TL;DR: LLM重定向攻击利用预置触发词篡改路由决策，本文系统化阐述威胁、评估脆弱性，提出RerouteGuard实现了高达99%+的检测率，堪称实用防护方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模AI系统通过LLM路由器降低计算成本，却缺乏对LLM重定向攻击的安全理解与防护，该攻击可导致成本激增、质量下降及安全规避。

Method: 本文首先构建LLM重定向威胁的分类体系，随后对真实路由系统进行测评与解析，利用可解释技术揭示攻击是通过预置触发词推导路由决策边界；最后提出RerouteGuard框架，采用动态嵌入式检测及自适应阈值过滤攻击提示，并在多攻击场景与四个基准上进行评估。

Result: 测评显示，当前路由系统在成本升级场景尤为脆弱；RerouteGuard在三种攻击设置和四个基准上取得超过99%的检测准确率，并对合法查询几乎无影响。

Conclusion: RerouteGuard提供了一种原则性的、可行的解决方案，能有效保障多模型AI系统免受LLM重定向攻击，研究同时揭示了现有路由系统在成本升级场景下的高度脆弱性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-model AI systems have leveraged LLM routers to reduce computational cost while maintaining response quality by assigning queries to the most appropriate model. However, as classifiers, LLM routers are vulnerable to novel adversarial attacks in the form of LLM rerouting, where adversaries prepend specially crafted triggers to user queries to manipulate routing decisions. Such attacks can lead to increased computational cost, degraded response quality, and even bypass safety guardrails, yet their security implications remain largely underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by systematizing LLM rerouting threats based on the adversary's objectives (i.e., cost escalation, quality hijacking, and safety bypass) and knowledge. Based on the threat taxonomy, we conduct a measurement study of real-world LLM routing systems against existing LLM rerouting attacks. The results reveal that existing routing systems are vulnerable to rerouting attacks, especially in the cost escalation scenario. We then characterize existing rerouting attacks using interpretability techniques, revealing that they exploit router decision boundaries through confounder gadgets that prepend queries to force misrouting. To mitigate these risks, we introduce RerouteGuard, a flexible and scalable guardrail framework for LLM rerouting. RerouteGuard filters adversarial rerouting prompts via dynamic embedding-based detection and adaptive thresholding. Extensive evaluations in three attack settings and four benchmarks demonstrate that RerouteGuard achieves over 99% detection accuracy against state-of-the-art rerouting attacks, while maintaining negligible impact on legitimate queries. The experimental results indicate that RerouteGuard offers a principled and practical solution for safeguarding multi-model AI systems against adversarial rerouting.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有攻击忽略压缩导致鲁棒性评估过高，提出不需访问压缩机制的CAGE攻击，通过期望特征扰动和排名失真对齐提升攻击效果，实验显示CAGE在多场景下鲁棒准确率更低，强调压缩感知安全评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉标记压缩广泛用于加速LVLM，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未被探究。

Method: 提出CAGE攻击，结合期望特征扰动和排名失真对齐，在不获取压缩机制或标记预算的情况下，使扰动优化与压缩推理保持一致。

Result: CAGE在多种压缩机制及数据集上持续实现比基线更低的鲁棒准确率，验证了现有基于编码器的攻击过度高估鲁棒性的误差。

Conclusion: 忽视视觉标记压缩导致对压缩后的视觉-语言模型（LVLM）鲁棒性评估过于乐观，需要采用压缩感知的安全评估与防御方法。

Abstract: Visual token compression is widely used to accelerate large vision-language models (LVLMs) by pruning or merging visual tokens, yet its adversarial robustness remains unexplored. We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对目前在大模型文本分类中广泛使用的上下文学习（ICL）缺乏针对真实对抗威胁的鲁棒性评估和防御方案，本文旨在揭示并解决此空白。

Method: 设计了一个零查询、无模型参数访问的黑盒攻击框架ICL‑Evader，并提出了 Fake Claim、Template、Needle‑in‑a‑Haystack 三种针对ICL提示处理局限性的攻击手段。

Result: 实验表明三种攻击能够在情感分析、毒性检测和非法宣传任务中将预测准确率大幅下降（最高95.3%成功率），显著优于传统NLP攻击；同时系统地提出联合防御方案，在保持模型效能损失低于5%的前提下有效抵御所有三种攻击，并实现了自动化防御工具。

Conclusion: ICL在现实对抗环境下存在严重脆弱性，但通过合适的防御策略和工具可实现高效防护，为构建鲁棒ICL系统提供了可操作的安全加固路径。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a powerful, data-efficient paradigm for text classification using large language models. However, its robustness against realistic adversarial threats remains largely unexplored. We introduce ICL-Evader, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that operates under a highly practical zero-query threat model, requiring no access to model parameters, gradients, or query-based feedback during attack generation. We design three novel attacks, Fake Claim, Template, and Needle-in-a-Haystack, that exploit inherent limitations of LLMs in processing in-context prompts. Evaluated across sentiment analysis, toxicity, and illicit promotion tasks, our attacks significantly degrade classifier performance (e.g., achieving up to 95.3% attack success rate), drastically outperforming traditional NLP attacks which prove ineffective under the same constraints. To counter these vulnerabilities, we systematically investigate defense strategies and identify a joint defense recipe that effectively mitigates all attacks with minimal utility loss (<5% accuracy degradation). Finally, we translate our defensive insights into an automated tool that proactively fortifies standard ICL prompts against adversarial evasion. This work provides a comprehensive security assessment of ICL, revealing critical vulnerabilities and offering practical solutions for building more robust systems. Our source code and evaluation datasets are publicly available at: https://github.com/ChaseSecurity/ICL-Evader .

TL;DR: 扩散模型的噪声调度未能完全消除语义信息，攻击者可通过在初始噪声中注入语义来实现高效的成员推理攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中显著提升的同时，细调模型往往基于小型私有数据集，传统 MIA 需要中间结果或影子模型数据。

Method: 利用在最大噪声步骤下注入语义信息的初始噪声，分析模型生成结果来判断样本是否属于训练集，构成一种简单有效的 MIA 攻击。

Result: 实验表明，带语义信息的初始噪声可以在模型输出中显著区分成员与非成员样本，验证了扩散模型的 MI 侧漏。

Conclusion: 研究表明扩散模型在噪声调度中残留的语义信息会使其易受成员推理攻击 (MIA) 的影响，暴露训练数据的隐私。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image generation, but their increasing deployment raises serious concerns about privacy. In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the semantic initial noise can strongly reveal membership information, highlighting the vulnerability of diffusion models to MIAs.

Abstract: Network protocol fingerprinting is used to identify a protocol implementation by analyzing its input-output behavior. Traditionally, fingerprinting operates under a closed-world assumption, where models of all implementations are assumed to be available. However, this assumption is unrealistic in practice. When this assumption does not hold, fingerprinting results in numerous misclassifications without indicating that a model for an implementation is missing. Therefore, we introduce an open-world variant of the fingerprinting problem, where not all models are known in advance. We propose an incremental fingerprinting approach to solve the problem by combining active automata learning with closed-world fingerprinting. Our approach quickly determines whether the implementation under consideration matches an available model using fingerprinting and conformance checking. If no match is found, it learns a new model by exploiting the structure of available models. We prove the correctness of our approach and improvements in asymptotic complexity compared to naive baselines. Moreover, experimental results on a variety of protocols demonstrate a significant reduction in misclassifications and interactions with these black-boxes.

TL;DR: WADBERT采用分层嵌入+双BERT+多头注意力，自然语言处理技术提升Web攻击检测精度，可精准定位恶意参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以嵌入不规则HTTP请求，尤其是无序参数和攻击追踪难点，需改进模型以提高检测准确性和可解释性。

Method: 利用Hybrid Granularity Embedding形成细粒度URL与载荷向量，分别通过URLBERT与SecBERT提取语义，再用多头注意力融合参数级特征，最终将URL与载荷特征拼接输入线性分类器。

Result: 在CSIC2010与SR-BH2020数据集上分别取得99.63%和99.50%的F1分数，显著优于最新方法。

Conclusion: WADBERT通过混合粒度嵌入和两种BERT模型有效识别HTTP请求中的恶意参数，实现高检测准确率并支持攻击追踪。

Abstract: Web attack detection is the first line of defense for securing web applications, designed to preemptively identify malicious activities. Deep learning-based approaches are increasingly popular for their advantages: automatically learning complex patterns and extracting semantic features from HTTP requests to achieve superior detection performance. However, existing methods are less effective in embedding irregular HTTP requests, even failing to model unordered parameters and achieve attack traceability. In this paper, we propose an effective web attack detection model, named WADBERT. It achieves high detection accuracy while enabling the precise identification of malicious parameters. To this end, we first employ Hybrid Granularity Embedding (HGE) to generate fine-grained embeddings for URL and payload parameters. Then, URLBERT and SecBERT are respectively utilized to extract their semantic features. Further, parameter-level features (extracted by SecBERT) are fused through a multi-head attention mechanism, resulting in a comprehensive payload feature. Finally, by feeding the concatenated URL and payload features into a linear classifier, a final detection result is obtained. The experimental results on CSIC2010 and SR-BH2020 datasets validate the efficacy of WADBERT, which respectively achieves F1-scores of 99.63% and 99.50%, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 扩展Tamarin支持完整DH理论（含指数加法）后，成功验证ElGamal并复现MQV攻击，首次实现对完整DH运算的形式化协议验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号协议验证器无法处理指数加法这一操作，导致对使用完整DH运算的协议缺乏完整形式验证，迫切需要可处理该运算的工具。

Method: 采用理论近似和半决策程序，先把包含全部DH运算的理论转化为可处理的子理论，并在Tamarin中实现对应的推理规则，随后用该框架评估协议安全性。

Result: 在扩展后的Tamarin下验证了ElGamal加密的安全性，同时重新发现了MQV协议的已知攻击，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过扩展Tamarin证明器实现对完整Diffie-Hellman理论（包括指数加法）的支持后，能够对涉及所有DH运算的协议进行形式化验证，这是当前该类工具首次实现此功能。

Abstract: Diffie-Hellman groups are commonly used in cryptographic protocols. While most state-of-the-art, symbolic protocol verifiers support them to some degree, they do not support all mathematical operations possible in these groups. In particular, they lack support for exponent addition, as these tools reason about terms using unification, which is undecidable in the theory describing all Diffie-Hellman operators. In this paper we approximate such a theory and propose a semi-decision procedure to determine whether a protocol, which may use all operations in such groups, satisfies user-defined properties. We implement this approach by extending the Tamarin prover to support the full Diffie-Hellman theory, including group element multiplication and hence addition of exponents. This is the first time a state-of-the-art tool can model and reason about such protocols. We illustrate our approach's effectiveness with different case studies: ElGamal encryption and MQV. Using Tamarin, we prove security properties of ElGamal, and we rediscover known attacks on MQV.

TL;DR: 提出归一化建议量NAQ，用于量化任务难度，并证明其与最小建议复杂度、本质上与率失真理论相连，同时扩展到资源受限和 NP 上界，提供经验估计收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种尺度无关、鲁棒的指标来量化不同任务的难度，并与算法复杂度、可行性及资源约束关联，构建一个统一评估框架。

Method: 在输入盲执行器上定义可验证谓词V(x,r)，引入最小可实现复杂度M(x)=min_{r:V(x,r)=1} K(r)，构造归一化建议量（NAQ）作为M(x)在参考池上的百分位，并证明在描述与选择成本分离、有限歧义与通用纤维区间内的等价性与上界。随后将NAQ与率失真理论对接，得到通信建议长度的逆律，扩展为时间受限的NAQ_t（Levin Kt）和NP范式下的线性上界，并用 DKW 定理保证经验估计的收敛。

Result: NAQ 成为无量纲的难度指数，在理论上与最小建议复杂度一致；在有限歧义场景下可近似为 min_y K(y)，在通用纤区间内逼近取值；对枚举有限变化保持准不变。推导出的操作逆显示通信建议长度与目标特征熵相似；资源受限变体与 NP 线性上界提供额外视角。DKW 收敛保证验证了经验 NAQ 的可靠性。

Conclusion: 本文构建了基于算法信息论的证解过滤与归一化建议量的难度量化框架，证明了其理论属性、与率失真及资源约束的关联，并提供实用的经验估计方法，展示了一种统一、尺度无关且可计算的任务难度评估方案。

Abstract: We introduce a validity-filtered, certificate-based view of reactions grounded in Algorithmic Information Theory. A fixed, total, input-blind executor maps a self-delimiting advice string to a candidate response, accepted only if a decidable or semi-decidable validity predicate V(x, r) holds. The minimum feasible realizer complexity M(x) = min_{r: V(x,r)=1} K(r), with K denoting prefix Kolmogorov complexity, measures the minimal information required for a valid outcome. We define the Normalized Advice Quantile (NAQ) as the percentile of M(x) across a reference pool, yielding a scale-free hardness index on [0, 1] robust to the choice of universal machine and comparable across task families. An Exact Realizer Identity shows that the minimal advice for any input-blind executor equals M(x) up to O(1), while a description plus selection upper bound refines it via computable feature maps, separating description cost K(y) from selection cost log i_y(x). In finite-ambiguity regimes M(x) approximately equals min_y K(y); in generic-fiber regimes the bound is tight. NAQ is quasi-invariant under bounded enumeration changes. An operational converse links NAQ to rate-distortion: communicating advice with error epsilon requires average length near the entropy of target features. Extensions include a resource-bounded variant NAQ_t incorporating time-penalized complexity (Levin's Kt) and an NP-style setting showing linear worst-case advice n - O(1). Finally, a DKW bound guarantees convergence of empirical NAQ estimates, enabling data-driven calibration via compressor-based proxies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩感知OMP在高压缩率下因DFT网格偏差和混叠噪声导致不可消除误差；SNGEM旨在克服这些限制，实现更高精度的参数估计。

Method: 采用同步奈奎斯特折叠广义特征值方法（SNGEM），利用原始信号及其时间导数的联合处理，并推导了两通道等信噪比情况时幅值比参数R的准确CRB。

Result: Monte‑Carlo仿真表明SNGEM在无噪声条件下达到机器精度，并在10–20倍压缩率下仍靠近CRB，而OMP显著偏离。

Conclusion: SNGEM在极低亚奈奎斯特采样率下实现了多音信号的全频率/幅值/相位估计，并在所有信噪比下逼近所推导的CRB，证明其几乎达到统计学上最佳的确定性参数光谱分析性能。

Abstract: The synchronous Nyquist folding generalized eigenvalue method (SNGEM) realizes full frequency/amplitude/phase estimation of multitone signals at extreme sub-Nyquist rates by jointly processing the original signals and their time derivatives. In this paper, accurate Cramer-Rao bounds for amplitude ratio parameter R=A/B=1/(2\pif) are derived for two channels with equal SNR. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm that SNGEM achieves machine accuracy in noise-free conditions and closely approaches the derived CRB at all SNR levels, even at 10- 20x compression, whereas classical compressive sensing OMP exhibits irreducible error flattening due to DFT grid bias and aliasing noise. These results establish SNGEM as a statistically nearly optimal deterministic sub-Nyquist parameter spectrum analysis

Motivation: 传统数字体系结构在极大天线阵列（ELAAs）中激活全部天线会导致巨大的功耗，制约了集成感知与通信（ISAC）的应用。

Method: 提出能效子阵列激活框架，通过在满足感知与通信质量服务(QoS)约束的前提下，选择最优子阵列子集以最小化总功耗，并使用基于连续凸逼近(SCA)的迭代算法求解该优化问题。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法在保持双功能性能的同时，显著降低了功耗。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种在极大天线阵列中实现能效的子阵列激活策略，为 ISAC 系统的功耗管理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider power consumption reduction in extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. Although ELAAs are critical for achieving high-resolution near-field sensing, fully activating all antenna elements in conventional digital architectures leads to prohibitive power demands. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient subarray activation framework that selects an optimal subset of subarrays to minimize the total power consumption, subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for both sensing and communication. We formulate a novel optimization problem and solve it using a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining dual-function performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统删失码（尤其是对抗性删失通道）冗余较高，难以满足低冗余需求；纳米孔通道出现了新的实际应用场景，需要针对有限删失数的高效码。

Method: 利用构造性编码方法，设计了长度$ n $的$q$-元码，保证在至多$t$个删失的情况下能够恢复；通过信息理论与组合论手段对冗余进行上限与下限分析。

Result: 显著降低了对抗性$q$-元删失通道的可构造冗余，从$4t(1+ε)\log_q n$降到$2t\log_q n+Θ(\log\log n)$；同时确立了最优冗余的上下界，证明构造近似最优。

Conclusion: 构造了一类针对最大可删失$t$个错误的纳米管通道的$ q $-元码，冗余为$2t\log_q n+Θ(\log\log n)$，并证明了该冗余在先验极限的一级上与最优冗余匹配；相比传统删除通道，提出码的冗余显著降低。

Abstract: We study deletion-correcting codes for an adversarial nanopore channel in which at most $t$ deletions may occur. We propose an explicit construction of $q$-ary codes of length $n$ for this channel with $2t\log_q n+Θ(\log\log n)$ redundant symbols. We also show that the optimal redundancy is between $t\log_q n+Ω(1)$ and $2t\log_q n-\log_q\log_2 n+O(1)$, so our explicit construction matches the existential upper bound to first order. In contrast, for the classical adversarial $q$-ary deletion channel, the smallest redundancy achieved by known explicit constructions that correct up to $t$ deletions is $4t(1+ε)\log_q n+o(\log n)$.

Abstract: Belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) provides a low-complexity alternative to collective measurements for communication over classical--quantum channels. Prior BPQM constructions and density-evolution (DE) analyses have focused on binary alphabets. Here, we generalize BPQM to symmetric q-ary pure-state channels (PSCs) whose output Gram matrix is circulant. For this class, we show that bit-node and check-node combining can be tracked efficiently via closed-form recursions on the Gram-matrix eigenvalues, independent of the particular physical realization of the output states. These recursions yield explicit BPQM unitaries and analytic bounds on the fidelities of the combined channels in terms of the input-channel fidelities. This provides a DE framework for symmetric q-ary PSCs that allows one to estimate BPQM decoding thresholds for LDPC codes and to construct polar codes on these channels.

Abstract: Unpredictable sensor-to-estimator delays fundamentally distort what matters for wireless remote state estimation: not just freshness, but how delay interacts with sensor informativeness and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a unified, delay-aware framework that models this coupling explicitly and quantifies a delay-dependent information gain, motivating an information-per-joule scheduling objective beyond age of information proxies (AoI). To this end, we first introduce an efficient posterior-fusion update that incorporates delayed measurements without state augmentation, providing a consistent approximation to optimal delayed Kalman updates, and then derive tractable stability conditions ensuring that bounded estimation error is achievable under stochastic, delayed scheduling. This conditions highlight the need for unstable modes to be observable across sensors. Building on this foundation, we cast scheduling as a Markov decision process and develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheduler that learns directly from interaction, requires no prior delay model, and explicitly trades off estimation accuracy, freshness, sensor heterogeneity, and transmission energy through normalized rewards. In simulations with heterogeneous sensors, realistic link-energy models, and random delays, the proposed method learns stably and consistently achieves lower estimation error at comparable energy than random scheduling and strong RL baselines (DQN, A2C), while remaining robust to variations in measurement availability and process/measurement noise.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of computing the set of diagonal transversal gates fixing a CSS code. We determine the logical actions of the gates as well as the groups of transversal gates that induce non-trivial logical gates and logical identities. We explicitly declare the set of equations defining the groups, a key advantage and differentiator of our approach. We compute the complete set of transversal stabilizers and transversal gates for any CSS code arising from monomial codes, a family that includes decreasing monomial codes and polar codes. As a consequence, we recover and extend some results in the literature on CSS-T codes, triorthogonal codes, and divisible codes.

Abstract: In some rate-distortion-type problems, the required fidelity of information is affected by past actions. As a result, the distortion function depends not only on the instantaneous distortion between a source symbol and its representation symbol, but also on past representations. In this paper, we give a formal definition of this problem and introduce both inner (achievable) and outer bounds on the rate-distortion tradeoff. We also discuss convexification of the problem, which makes it easier to find bounds. Problems of this type arise in biological information processing, as well as in recommendation engines; we provide an example applied to a simplified biological information processing problem.

Abstract: The fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility remains an active area of research. Our contribution is motivated by two observations. First, privacy mechanisms developed for one-time data release cannot straightforwardly be extended to sequential releases. Second, practical databases are likely to be useful to multiple distinct parties. Furthermore, we can not rule out the possibility of data sharing between parties. With utility in mind, we formulate a privacy-utility trade-off problem to adaptively tackle sequential data requests made by different, potentially colluding entities. We consider both expected distortion and mutual information as measures to quantify utility, and use mutual information to measure privacy. We assume an attack model whereby illicit data sharing, which we call collusion, can occur between data receivers. We develop an adaptive algorithm for data releases that makes use of a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. We show that the resulting data releases are optimal when expected distortion quantifies utility, and locally optimal when mutual information quantifies utility. Finally, we discuss how our findings may extend to applications in machine learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates information freshness in a remote estimation system in which the remote information source is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate.

TL;DR: 研发稀疏Grassmannian编码，改进误差概率分析，得到闭式AMIMax指标，设计稀疏非协同码，实验验证SER/AMI优于传统，且复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对偶误差概率公式无法处理稀疏配置下的秩缺失，导致非协同MIMO系统性能受限；需要一种统一处理稀疏配置并提高AMI与SER的方法。

Method: 通过修正传统无相关瑞利衰落条件下的对偶误差概率公式，引入稀疏配置导致的秩缺失问题；利用Schubert胞分解导出闭式指标来最大化非协同平均互信息，并据此给出稀疏代码设计准则。

Result: 实验表明所提出的稀疏非协同代码在SER和AMI方面均优于传统方法，在高信噪比下逐渐接近最优Grassmannian星座，并显著降低时间和空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 稀疏Grassmannian编码在非协同MIMO系统中显著提升符号错误率与平均互信息，且在高信噪比下逼近最优Grassmannian星座，且计算复杂度不随发射天线数扩展。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for designing sparse Grassmannian codes for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output systems. Conventional pairwise error probability formulations under uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels fail to account for rank deficiency induced by sparse configurations. We revise these formulations to handle such cases in a unified manner. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form metric that effectively maximizes the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI) at a given signal-to-noise ratio. We focus on the fact that the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmann manifold provides a mathematically sparse property, and establish design criteria for sparse noncoherent codes based on our analyses. In numerical results, the proposed sparse noncoherent codes outperform conventional methods in terms of both symbol error rate and AMI, and asymptotically approach the performance of the optimal Grassmannian constellations in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime. Moreover, they reduce the time and space complexity, which does not scale with the number of transmit antennas.

TL;DR: 本文用随机几何与衰落模型系统性分析了3D室内THz通信中的指向误差对覆盖率的影响，发现单纯扩大奖口阵列无法解决问题，需研发更精准的定位与估计方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在THz频段，波束指向误差对系统覆盖性能影响显著，传统增大阵列尺寸的做法无法根本解决问题，亟需对指向误差和阻塞环境进行系统建模与理论分析。

Method: 采用泊松点过程建模AP位置，随机圆柱过程建模人身阻塞，布尔直线过程建模墙体阻塞，基于位置估计不准确性刻画指向误差，并使用多簇波动双波分布模型对THz小尺度衰落进行建模，推导闭式覆盖概率表达式。

Result: 通过仿真验证得出：指向误差对覆盖概率有显著负面影响；仅增大天线数组不足以抵消该影响；先进的估计技术是必要的改进方向。

Conclusion: 本文结果表明，单纯增大天线阵列尺寸无法有效提升3D室内THz通信系统的覆盖概率，指出需要采用更先进的定位与估计技术来减轻指向误差的负面影响。

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a tractable analytical framework for a three-dimensional (3D) indoor terahertz (THz) communication system to theoretically assess the impact of the pointing error on its coverage performance. Specifically, we model the locations of access points (APs) using a Poisson point process, human blockages as random cylinder processes, and wall blockages through a Boolean straight line process. A pointing error refers to beamforming gain and direction mismatch between the transmitter and receiver. We characterize it based on the inaccuracy of location estimate. We then analyze the impact of this pointing error on the received signal power and derive a tractable expression for the coverage probability, incorporating the multi-cluster fluctuating two-ray distribution to accurately model small-scale fading in THz communications. Aided by simulation results, we corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that the pointing error has a pronounced impact on the coverage probability. Specifically, we find that merely increasing the antenna array size is insufficient to improve the coverage probability and mitigate the detrimental impact of the pointing error, highlighting the necessity of advanced estimation techniques in THz communication systems.

Motivation: 传统时域ADC在每个采样周期需要显式重置，导致死时间限制分辨率、速度和能效。本研究旨在消除重置以提升高速度时域ADC性能。

Method: 提出双边缘无重置量化概念，利用升、降信号边缘在同一转换周期内实现无重置量化，并实现双边缘线性补偿的电压-时间转换器和可独立调节升降边缘延迟的时间数字转换器。

Result: 在22‑nm FD‑SOI实现8位双边缘异步管线SAR时域ADC，核心面积0.0089 mm²，连续单通道3.5 GS/s，峰值10.5 GS/s。3.5 GS/s时，SNDR 21.6 dB，SFDR 32.2 dB，主要受实现层面因素限制。

Conclusion: 双边缘无重置量化实现了高采样率、低死时间和高效能的时域ADC，可扩展到更高速度，验证了该概念的可行性。

Abstract: Time-domain ADCs are attractive for high-speed wireline receivers, as time resolution scales favorably with advanced CMOS technologies, enabling multi-GS/s single-channel sampling rates. However, conventional time-domain ADCs require explicit reset of voltage-to-time and time-domain signal paths between samples, introducing dead time that fundamentally limits resolution, speed, and energy efficiency. This paper introduces a dual-edge reset-free quantization concept for asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADCs, in which both rising and falling signal edges are exploited to enable reset-free quantization within a single conversion period. By eliminating explicit reset phases, the proposed approach expands the effective conversion window and relaxes the resolution-speed tradeoff at high sampling rates. An 8-bit dual-edge asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADC is implemented in 22-nm FD-SOI, incorporating a linearity-compensated dual-edge voltage-to-time converter and a dual-edge time-to-digital converter with independently tunable rising- and falling-edge delays. The prototype occupies a core area of 0.0089 mm^2 and achieves continuous single-channel operation at 3.5 GS/s, with architectural scalability demonstrated through intermittent operation at 10.5 GS/s and higher. At 3.5 GS/s, the ADC achieves 21.6 dB SNDR and 32.2 dB SFDR. The measured performance is primarily limited by identifiable implementation-level factors rather than by architectural constraints, demonstrating the feasibility of dual-edge reset-free quantization for high-speed time-domain ADCs.

TL;DR: 利用DFT线性化正交化互调波，实时低误差、低时延功率测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互调波在电力系统中会削弱傅里叶正交性，导致功率测量误差加剧，亟需一种能够在异步采样与基频漂移环境下准确分离互调波的算法。

Method: 通过将DFT频谱转换为线性方程组，并运用矩阵运算求解，提取基频、谐波及其附近互调波成分，从而精确计算功率。

Result: 实验验证显示，该方法在不同互调波/基频/谐波间隔、基频漂移以及噪声条件下均能准确计算功率，误差较FFT、窗口插值FFT和矩阵支点-奇异值分解降低数倍，在200 ms采样窗口内仅需7 ms计算时间。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于DFT谱线性化的算法能在含互调波的电力系统中实现精确功率测量，在非同步采样、基频偏移等恶劣条件下显著降低误差，并保持低运算延迟。

Abstract: The presence of interharmonics in power systems can lead to asynchronous sampling, a phenomenon further aggravated by shifts in the fundamental frequency, which significantly degrades the accuracy of power measurements. Under such asynchronous conditions, interharmonics lose orthogonality with the fundamental and harmonic components, giving rise to additional power components. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a linearization algorithm based on DFT spectrum analysis for precise power measurement in systems containing interharmonics. The proposed approach constructs a system of linear equations from the DFT spectrum and solves it through efficient matrix operations, enabling accurate extraction of interharmonic components near the fundamental and harmonic frequencies (with a frequency interval $\geq$1 Hz). This allows for precise measurement of power across the fundamental, harmonic, interharmonic, and cross-power bands, as well as total power. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately computes various power components under diverse conditions--including varying interharmonic/fundamental/harmonic intervals, fundamental frequency deviations, and noise. Compared to existing methods such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), Windowed interpolation FFT, and Matrix pencil-Singular value decomposition, the proposed technique reduces estimation error by several times to multiple folds and exhibits improved robustness, while maintaining a computational time of only 7 ms for processing 10-power-line-cycle (200 ms) data.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication is a key feature in next-generation wireless networks, enabling joint data transmission and environmental radar sensing on shared spectrum. In multi-user scenarios, simultaneous transmissions cause mutual interference on overlapping frequencies, leading to spurious target detections and degraded sensing accuracy. This paper proposes an interference detection and exploitation algorithm for sensing using spectrally interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. A statistically rigorous procedure is introduced to detect interference while controlling the familywise error rate. We propose an algorithm that estimates the angle by exploiting interference, while estimating the delay by avoiding the interference. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method reliably detects interference, and that the delay and angle estimation error approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound.

Motivation: 大型孔径阵列是近场ISAC高分辨率定位的关键，但全数字实现成本高，稀疏子阵降低成本的同时引入镜像瓣分辨歧义。

Method: 采用两阶段分层稀疏恢复：第一阶段利用各子阵的粗角估计消除镜像瓣效应；第二阶段在完整稀疏孔径上执行局部角-距离联合搜索，避免了全二维网格搜索。

Result: 仿真表明，SHARE在定位精度和鲁棒性上均优于传统一Shot稀疏恢复方法OMP，并能与乃至超越完全未压缩数据的2D-MUSIC。

Conclusion: SHARE实现了与全数字MUSIC相当或更优的近场ISAC定位精度，并显著降低了硬件复杂度和费用；验证了分层稀疏恢复的有效性。

Abstract: Near-field localization for ISAC requires large-aperture arrays, making fully-digital implementations prohibitively complex and costly. While sparse subarray architectures can reduce cost, they introduce severe estimation ambiguity from grating lobes. To address both issues, we propose SHARE (Sparse Hierarchical Angle-Range Estimation), a novel two-stage sparse recovery algorithm. SHARE operates in two stages. It first performs coarse, unambiguous angle estimation using individual subarrays to resolve the grating lobe ambiguity. It then leverages the full sparse aperture to perform a localized joint angle-range search. This hierarchical approach avoids an exhaustive and computationally intensive two-dimensional grid search while preserving the high resolution of the large aperture. Simulation results show that SHARE significantly outperforms conventional one-shot sparse recovery methods, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in both localization accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we show that SHARE's overall localization accuracy is comparable to or even surpasses that of the fully-digital 2D-MUSIC algorithm, despite MUSIC having access to the complete, uncompressed data from every antenna element. SHARE therefore provides a practical path for high-resolution near-field ISAC systems.

Abstract: Acquiring channel state information (CSI) through traditional methods, such as channel estimation, is increasingly challenging for the emerging sixth generation (6G) mobile networks due to high overhead. To address this issue, channel extrapolation techniques have been proposed to acquire complete CSI from a limited number of known CSIs. To improve extrapolation accuracy, environmental information, such as visual images or radar data, has been utilized, which poses challenges including additional hardware, privacy and multi-modal alignment concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a novel channel extrapolation framework by leveraging environment-related multi-path characteristics induced directly from CSI without integrating additional modalities. Specifically, we propose utilizing the multi-path characteristics in the form of power-delay profile (PDP), which is acquired using a CSI-to-PDP module. CSI-to-PDP module is trained in an AE-based framework by reconstructing the PDPs and constraining the latent low-dimensional features to represent the CSI. We further extract the total power & power-weighted delay of all the identified paths in PDP as the multi-path information. Building on this, we proposed a MAE architecture trained in a self-supervised manner to perform channel extrapolation. Unlike standard MAE approaches, our method employs separate encoders to extract features from the masked CSI and the multi-path information, which are then fused by a cross-attention module. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this framework improves extrapolation performance dramatically, with a minor increase in inference time (around 0.1 ms). Furthermore, our model shows strong generalization capabilities, particularly when only a small portion of the CSI is known, outperforming existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本文证明变分状态估计（VSE）方法能够在没有物理模型的前提下，通过RNN实现噪声非线性观测的高精度高效状态估计，并在洛伦兹系统跟踪任务中与已知模型的粒子滤波器和无模型的数据驱动方法竞争表现优异。

Abstract: We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.

Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) have gained significant attention in recent years to overcome the limitations of extremely large antenna arrays in terms of cost and power consumption. In this paper, we investigate the use of MA arrays at the base station (BS) for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation under uncertainty in the user equipment (UE) location. Specifically, we (i) derive the theoretical performance limits through the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) and (ii) optimize the antenna positions to ensure robust performance within the UE's uncertainty region. Numerical results show that dynamically optimizing antenna placement by explicitly considering the uncertainty region yields superior performance compared to fixed arrays, demonstrating the ability of MA systems to adapt and outperform conventional arrays.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites play a pivotal role in global connectivity-delivering high-speed Internet, cellular coverage, and massive IoT support. With ever-growing onboard computing and storage resources, LEO satellites herald a new cloud paradigm: space cloud computing. While container or chestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) excel in terrestrial data centers, they are ill-suited to LEO satellite networks, featuring geographic dispersion and frequent handovers. Those features bring high latency and intermittent management, leading to control plane failure in container orchestration. To address this, we propose KubeSpace, a low-latency and stable control plane specifically designed for container orchestration on LEO satellites. KubeSpace combines two key innovations: a distributed ground-control-node architecture that binds each satellite to its nearest controller for uninterrupted management, and an orbit-aware placement with dynamic assignment strategy that further minimizes communication latency and handover frequency. Extensive experiments based on real satellite traces demonstrate that compared to existing solutions, KubeSpace reduces the average management latency of satellite nodes by 59% without any management interruption time.

Abstract: We consider a Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) system consisting of a sensor, a set of users, and a sensor cloud service provider (SCSP). The sensor updates its content each time it captures a new measurement. The SCSP occasionally fetches the content from the sensor, caches the latest fetched version and broadcasts it on being requested by the users. The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.

Abstract: Microtransit systems represent an enhancement to solve the first- and last-mile problem, integrating traditional rail and bus networks with on-demand shuttles into a flexible, integrated system. This type of demand responsive transport provides greater accessibility and higher quality levels of service compared to conventional fixed-route transit services. Advances in technology offer further opportunities to enhance microtransit performance. In particular, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have the potential to transform the mobility landscape by enabling more sustainable operations, enhanced user convenience, and greater system reliability. This paper investigates the integration of SAVs in microtransit systems, advancing the technological capabilities of on-demand shuttles. A shuttle dispatching optimization model is enhanced to accommodate for driver behavior and SAV functionalities. A model predictive control approach is proposed that dynamically rebalances on-demand shuttles towards areas of higher demand without relying on vast historical data. Scenario-driven experiments are conducted using data from the MARTA Reach microtransit pilot. The results demonstrate that SAVs can elevate both service quality and user experience compared to traditional on-demand shuttles in microtransit systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of circumnavigation of a stationary target by a heterogeneous group comprising of $\textbf{n}$ autonomous agents, having unicycle kinematics. The agents are assumed to have constant linear speeds, we control only the angular speeds. Assuming limited sensing capabilities of the agents, in the proposed framework, only a subset of agents, termed as \textit{leaders}, know the target location. The rest, termed as \textit{followers}, do not. We propose a distributed guidance law which drives all the agents towards the desired objective; global asymptotic stability (GAS) is ensured by using Zubov's theorem. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through both numerical simulations and hardware experiments on the TurtleBots utilising OptiTrack motion capture system.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of extreme weather events driven by climate change poses significant challenges to power system resilience. Infrastructure damage and prolonged power outages highlight the urgent need for effective grid-hardening strategies. While some measures provide long-term protection against specific hazards, they can become counterproductive under conflicting threats. In this work, we develop an adaptive two-stage stochastic optimization framework to support dynamic decision-making for hardening critical grid components under multiple hazard exposures. Unlike traditional approaches, our model adapts to evolving climate conditions, enabling more resilient investment strategies. Furthermore, we integrate long-term (undergrounding) and short-term (vegetation management) hardening actions to jointly minimize total system costs. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing outage and repair costs while enhancing the adaptability and robustness of grid infrastructure planning.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive generation by separating token proposal from verification, but most existing approaches are designed for single-node execution and do not scale well to multi-accelerator clusters used for serving modern Large Language Models (LLMs). We present StarSD, a one-for-many speculative decoding framework that uses a single draft model to serve multiple target models across distributed nodes via a star topology. StarSD decouples drafting and verification, enabling effective sharing of draft computation, and preventing distributed accelerators from remaining idle under bursty workloads. We provide a system-level analysis that characterizes when and why a single draft model can remain fully utilized by multiple verifiers, yielding predictable latency and utilization gains. Extensive experiments in real-world distributed inference settings demonstrate that StarSD simplifies deployment and supports flexible resource allocation across heterogeneous accelerators, while maintaining output quality. These results indicate that StarSD is a practical and scalable framework for bringing speculative decoding to modern cloud and edge inference infrastructures.

Abstract: Probabilistic resource adequacy assessment is a cornerstone of modern capacity accreditation. This paper develops a gradient-based framework, in which capacity accreditation is interpreted as the directional derivative of a probabilistic resource adequacy metric with respect to resource capacity, that unifies two widely used accreditation approaches: Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) and Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI). Under mild regularity conditions, we show that marginal ELCC and MRI yield equivalent accreditation factors, while their numerical implementations exhibit markedly different computational characteristics. Building on this framework, we demonstrate how infinitesimal perturbation analysis enables up to a $1000\times$ speedup in gradient estimation for capacity accreditation, and we implement gradient-informed search algorithms that significantly accelerate ELCC computations relative to standard bisection methods. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments show that MRI achieves substantial runtime reductions compared to ELCC and exhibits greater robustness to perturbation step-size selection. These results provide practical guidance for implementing efficient and scalable capacity accreditation in large-scale power systems.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of capacity markets, many electricity markets in the U.S. are adopting or planning to implement marginal capacity accreditation reforms. This paper provides new insights into energy storage capacity accreditation using Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI). We reformulate the commonly used reliability-based storage dispatch model as an optimization problem, enabling direct calculation of the MRI from the Lagrange multipliers, rather than using brute-force perturbation analysis. The analysis demonstrates that the EUE is a piecewise linear function and the storage MRI retains a non-negative property across various system scenarios. We further explore the influence of qualified capacity (QC), storage dispatch rules, and other key factors on storage accreditation, providing practical insights for system operators. Additionally, comparisons of storage capacity accreditation under different reliability criteria offer valuable guidance for policymakers in setting future standards. Numerical results from a modified California system validate our findings and highlight several important phenomena associated with the MRI-based accreditation scheme.

Abstract: High renewable penetration increases the frequency and magnitude of net-load ramps, stressing real-time flexibility. Two commonly deployed remedies are look-ahead economic dispatch (LAED) and ramp products (RPs), yet their operational equivalence under the industry-standard rolling-window dispatch implementation is not well understood. This paper develops linear optimization models for multi-interval LAED and RP-based co-optimization, and proves that an enhanced RP formulation can match LAED's dispatch feasible region at a single time step when additional intertemporal deliverability constraints are enforced. We then show that this equivalence does not generally persist under rolling-window operation because LAED and RP formulations optimize different intertemporal objectives, leading to divergent end-of-window states. Using different test systems under stressed ramping conditions and multiple load levels, we show LAED achieves similar or lower load shedding than RP implementations with the same look-ahead horizon, with the most pronounced differences under high-load, ramp-limited conditions. The study highlights the limitations of current ramp product implementations and suggests enhancements, such as introducing more mid-duration RPs.

TL;DR: 动态自适应与专属库检索，提升组合优化器速度与泛化，LLM适配成本大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的组合优化中手工设计启发式方法繁琐且难以适用于新分布。

Method: DASH框架结合了收敛感知评估和动态调度，采用Profiled Library Retrieval（PLR）来缓解LLM重新适配成本。

Result: 实验表明DASH在四个组合优化问题上提升了运行效率3倍以上，且在不同规模和分布下均优于现有基线，并将LLM适配成本降低90%。

Conclusion: DASH通过动态自适应策略和专业库检索，实现了高效且跨分布的启发式搜索，为LLM驱动的组合优化奠定了可靠方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

Motivation: 标准多模态预训练忽略了在应用中仅使用单模态的事实，导致代表学习方向不当。

Method: 采用更高遮挡难度、增强损失权重及扩大的解码器容量，聚焦目标模态的预训练策略。

Result: 在无线信号星座图掩码建模基准上，FIP始终提升了微调效果。

Conclusion: FIP在下游微调中提升了单模态性能并保持了无需额外数据或计算的优势。

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Motivation: 现有方法为每个任务分配固定prompt，导致知识隔离，参数利用率低下，需解决这一瓶颈。

Result: 实验显示该方案在效果和效率上均优于传统静态分配策略。

Conclusion: 通过动态共享prompt并结合任务感知门路与历史感知调节，显著提升了持续学习的效果与参数利用率。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要对患者临床事件和进展轨迹进行高精度预测，但现有方法难以处理稀疏、多模态的纵向时序数据，限制了预测性能和临床应用。

Method: 先将多模态的纵向患者历史序列序列化成文本格式，再通过大语言模型进行统一事件预测与时间序列预测；构建大型Genie Digital Twin模型，对93,054例癌症患者进行训练，并在多项基准任务（生存、病程进展、治疗转变）上与最强基线进行对比。

Result: GDT将中位MASE从0.97降至0.87（p<0.001），风险分层平均C-index提升至0.703（基线0.662）；在外部分布的临床试验中零样本匹配基线，微调后MASE介于0.75-0.88，事件预测C-index为0.672优于基线0.648。

Conclusion: TwinWeaver和其实现的Genie Digital Twin（GDT）展示了在精准医疗临床预测中的显著提升，降低了时间序列预测误差，提升了风险分层性能，并在不同临床试验分布中表现出鲁棒的泛化能力。该框架为多模态纵向临床数据提供了一种可解释、可扩展且统一的建模方法，具备将预测结果与临床决策相结合的潜力。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

TL;DR: 提出“Noisy but Valid”框架，利用小样本校准估计判定者误差并构造方差校正阈值，在有限样本下实现 Type-I 错误控制，理论与实证均验证其优越性，并揭示与最优“Oracle”之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在 LLM 评估中使用“LLM-as-a-Judge”可扩展，但判定者的不完备性、噪声与偏差会破坏统计保障，急需一种能够在判定者不完善时仍能保证统计有效性的框架。

Method: 利用小规模人工标注的校准集估计判定者的 TPR/FPR，构造方差校正的临界阈值，并应用于大规模判定者标注数据集，从而在有限样本条件下完成无噪声但有效的假设检验。

Result: 理论推导确认在噪声测试条件下可获得更高统计功效；在 Jigsaw Comment、Hate Speech 与 SafeRLHF 数据集上实证验证；揭示方法与理论最优“Oracle”之间存在显著性能差距，量化了估计误差带来的成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出了“Noisy but Valid”假设检验框架，能够在判定错误率低于安全阈值时，保证有限样本下的 Type-I 错误控制，即使对评判者的真阳性/假阳性率存在估计不确定性，仍能提供统计有效性。

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

Conclusion: 本研究证明了一种可行的非侵入性颅内压（ICP）估计方法，为在急性脑损伤及相关病症中的安全、广泛可获取ICP监测奠定了基础。

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

Motivation: 大量儿童在每年面临可预防的发展延迟，然而在新国家部署机器学习受到数据瓶颈限制：可靠模型需要成千上万样本，而新项目通常不足100个样本。

Method: 构建首个全球儿童发展预训练编码器，在从联合国儿童基金会收集的357,709名跨44个国家儿童调查数据上进行训练，随后使用极少量样本进行微调，并利用迁移学习界限解释多样性预训练如何实现少样本迁移。

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 信息论框架为扩散模型提供了维度无关的收敛保证，可通过 LAS 实现更高效的逆 SDE 离散，提升采样效果

Abstract: Diffusion generative models synthesize samples by discretizing reverse-time dynamics driven by a learned score (or denoiser). Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps. Moreover, using a reformulation of the KL divergence, we propose a Loss-Adaptive Schedule (LAS) for efficient discretization of reverse SDE which is lightweight and relies only on the training loss, requiring no post-training heavy computation. Empirically, LAS improves sampling quality over common heuristic schedules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在顶k项识别中，精确估值往往昂贵；引入高效且噪声弱的弱oracle以及稀缺但准确信的强oracle，可通过合适的协同策略显著降低整体评估成本。

Method: 首先采用基于弱oracle的快速筛选与强oracle的精准认证的STC基线。随后提出自适应认证算法ACE，聚焦于边缘关键项，以O(m(4ε_max))的强oracle调用数实现理论最优。最后开发双阶段自适应方法ACE‑W，在运行ACE前动态分配弱oracle预算，进一步压缩强oracle成本。

Result: STC基线在弱oracle误差≤ε_max时强oracle调用次数上限为m(4ε_max)，并且存在下界Ω(m(ε_max))；ACE恰好达到此上限并在实测中强oracle调用大幅下降；ACE‑W进一步利用弱oracle预分配自适应阶梯，进一步削减强oracle开销。

Conclusion: ACE与ACE-W在双oracle设置下实现了接近最优的强oracle调用数，实质性降低了在顶k选取任务中的高成本查询需求。

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

Abstract: Transformers achieve superior performance on many tasks, but impose heavy compute and memory requirements during inference. This inference can be made more efficient by partitioning the process across multiple devices, which, in turn, requires compressing its intermediate representations. In this work, we introduce a principled rate-distortion-based framework for lossy compression that learns compact encodings that explicitly trade off bitrate against accuracy. Experiments on language benchmarks show that the proposed codec achieves substantial savings with improved accuracy in some cases, outperforming more complex baseline methods. We characterize and analyze the rate-distortion performance of transformers, offering a unified lens for understanding performance in representation coding. This formulation extends information-theoretic concepts to define the gap between rate and entropy, and derive some of its bounds. We further develop probably approximately correct (PAC)-style bounds for estimating this gap. For different architectures and tasks, we empirically demonstrate that their rates are driven by these bounds, adding to the explainability of the formulation.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study shows shallow‑wide transformers outperform overly deep ones; optimal depth grows slowly, width faster; beyond a critical depth adding layers hurts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating how architectural choices (depth vs width) affect language model scaling laws, beyond treating architecture as interchangeable.

Method: Derive architecture-conditioned scaling laws formalizing optimal depth and width vs computational cost; validate empirically on 30 transformer variants (17M-7B) and find depth‑criticality and performance trends.

Result: Optimal depth scales as D*∝C^0.12, width as W*∝C^0.34 (width grows ~2.8× faster). Identify a “critical depth” D_crit∝W^0.44 where adding layers worsens loss. Empirical validation: R^2=0.922 across models; at 7B, 64‑layer (6.38B) underperforms 32‑layer (6.86B) by 0.12 nats.

Conclusion: Depth‑width trade‑offs are significant at production scale; deeper models can degrade performance; optimal architectures balance depth and width per scaling laws.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink precoding offers high spectral efficiency but remains challenging to deploy in practice because near-optimal algorithms such as the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) are computationally expensive, and sensitive to SNR and channel-estimation quality, while existing deep learning (DL)-based solutions often lack robustness and require retraining for each deployment site. This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples. Across both architectures, PaPP achieves more than 21$\times$ reduction in modeled computation energy and maintains good performance under channel-estimation errors, making it a practical solution for energy-efficient mMIMO precoding.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全RL常在固定训练环境下评估，缺失对部署时分布变化的安全保证，需要检验训练时安全性是否转移到未见患者。

Method: 在一套统一的临床模拟器上，对8种安全RL算法、3种糖尿病类型与3个年龄组进行评估，并在测试时采用基于学习的动力学模型的屏障过滤不安全动作。

Result: 屏障技术在PPO-Lag、CPO等强基线上实现了13–14%的时间范围( Time‑in‑Range )提升，同时降低了临床风险指数和血糖波动。

Conclusion: 测试时屏障能够有效弥补安全泛化缺口，保持RL在分布偏移下的安全性能。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTA视测试流为独立样本，忽略了其中蕴含的时序监督信号，导致未能充分利用流动式数据的时间相关性。

Method: 将测试时适配建模为无梯度递归贝叶斯估计，使用学习到的动态转换矩阵作为时序先验来细化基模型预测；当时间证据缺失时通过似然比门LLR回退到基预测器，确保安全。

Result: 在图像分类、可穿戴/生理信号分析和语言情感分析等多领域实验中，OATTA相较既有基线提升了多达6.35%的准确率，且计算开销极低。

Conclusion: OATTA充分利用时间动态信息，补充了传统顺序无关TTA缺失的监督信号，证明了时间顺序是额外且互补的金手指，显著提升了模型在众多任务上的表现。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDM通过学习去噪向量场实现物理流形投影，提升了数据与参数效率，并在未使用物理方程训练的情况下更好地遵守物理约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的物理一致性建模在拟合精度与物理一致性之间存在折衷，现有方法对物理定律的约束往往不严格，或者仅在后处理阶段修正，难以在训练时学习解空间几何。

Method: 提出Conditional Denoising Model（CDM），通过将模型训练为从噪声恢复干净状态来学习物理流形的向量场；采用时间无关的形式，将推理转化为确定性固定点迭代，直接把噪声近似投影到平衡流形上。

Result: 在低温等离子体物理与化学基准测试中，CDM在参数及数据效率上优于传统的物理一致性基线，并在未见治理方程的情况下通过去噪目标实现更严格的物理约束遵循。

Conclusion: 去噪目标作为隐式正则化能够更好地捕捉物理流形几何，从而在不显式加入物理损失的前提下实现高精度且一致的物理建模。

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

Motivation: Current foundation models for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals struggle due to intrinsic redundancy and noise, causing standard masked modeling to produce trivial solutions and contrastive methods to lack morphological precision.

Method: Statistical‑prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA‑PPG) with a Prior‑Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, a reinforcement‑learning teacher incorporating statistical priors to generate challenging mask patterns, and a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantisation to map physiologically similar waveforms to shared indices.

Conclusion: SIGMA‑PPG presents a robust generative foundation model that mitigates noise overfitting and enhances semantic density, achieving state‑of‑the‑art results in diverse PPG applications.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 利用流匹配模型为智能电表数据多种生成任务统一提供单一模型，减少重复训练，提高效率，且生成数据既符合已观测信息又保持真实性。

Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.

TL;DR: 对扩散模型设定约束的前向过程，并采用 Predict-Project-Renoise 迭代反演，显著减少约束违规并提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经模拟器中，传统的扩散模型无法保证物理准确性和约束满足。

Method: 提出约束采样框架，通过在前向过程仅在满足约束的样本空间扩散，并使用 Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) 迭代算法在反向过程中替代传统离散化：预测去噪、投影到可行集、再去噪。

Result: 在二维分布、偏微分方程以及全球天气预报实验中，PPR 相比基线将约束违规降低一个数量级，并提升样本一致性与对真实约束分布的匹配度。

Conclusion: PPR 在保持物理约束的同时，使扩散模型能生成更符合科学要求的样本，为科学应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

TL;DR: 本工作针对矩阵因式分解下的随机分配模型，构造了基于 Rényi 散度与条件组合的无采样隐私放大方法。通过动态规划实现高效计算，并在实验中验证了其优越性，特别是在 ε 小、δ 取极小值时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的 Monte Carlo 采样方法在随机分配下的矩阵因式分解 DP 训练中只能给出高概率保证，或需要机制的随机弃权；且所需样本数与 δ 成反比，导致 δ 取小则样本量过大。面向需要更强、更确定性隐私保证的应用，亟需不依赖采样的新方法。

Method: 提出无采样的 Rényi 散度与条件组合框架。利用动态规划高效计算 Rényi 散度界，随后通过条件组合获得 ε 较小场景下更紧的隐私上界。

Result: 对任意带状或非带状矩阵均适用，通过数值实验显示该框架在广泛研究与实践中使用的矩阵机制上提供更优、计算更高效的隐私放大参数。

Conclusion: 我们提供了一个适用于 arbitrary banded 与非 banded 矩阵的采样无关的放大机制，能够在保证更强的 $(ε,δ)$-DP 的同时兼顾计算效率，从而填补了现有采样方法的不足。

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

Conclusion: 硬件差异性可被利用造后门，迫切需要对应防御

Abstract: Machine learning models are routinely deployed on a wide range of computing hardware. Although such hardware is typically expected to produce identical results, differences in its design can lead to small numerical variations during inference. In this work, we show that these variations can be exploited to create backdoors in machine learning models. The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware. We empirically demonstrate that these hardware-triggered backdoors can be created reliably across common GPU accelerators. Our findings reveal a novel attack vector affecting the use of third-party models, and we investigate different defenses to counter this threat.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督NCO方法要么追求跨实例泛化但缺乏实例级适配，要么在实例级微调时失去已学习的结构诱导，易陷入局部最优；如何在不牺牲已有先验结构的前提下实现高效实例级自适应，是研究核心。

Method: 设计了测试时自适应框架TACO，采用战略预热（warm‑starting）方式部分放宽已训练参数，保持其诱导偏置，同时在测试阶段对模型进行快速参数微调，从而实现跨实例通用模型与单实例自适应优化的有机融合。

Result: 在最小顶点覆盖（Minimum Vertex Cover）和最大团（Maximum Clique）等经典组合优化任务上，TACO在静态、分布偏移以及动态场景均表现出更优的解质，并且相较于纯微调或从零训练实例特定模型，额外计算成本可忽略。

Conclusion: TACO框架成功地在无监督神经组合优化中实现了可迁移的通用模型与实例特定适配的统一，兼顾了通用学习的先验推断力与单实例快速迭代的灵活性，显著提升了解决质量，且附加计算成本几乎为零。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

TL;DR: StepShield是首个评估违规检测时机的基准，揭示LLM判别器在早期检测上优于静态分析器，并通过早期干预显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准仅记录是否检测到违规，无法衡量检测时间，导致无法区分早期干预与事后分析。

Method: 设计包含9,213条轨迹（1,278对训练集、7,935条测试集）的基准，提出Early Intervention Rate、Intervention Gap、Tokens Saved等时间相关评估指标；在该基准上对LLM判别器和静态分析器进行性能比较；构建HybridGuard级联检测器以验证成本效益。

Result: LLM判别器的EIR为59%，静态分析器仅为26%，二者差距2.3倍；HybridGuard检测器将监控成本降低75%，在企业规模下预计五年内可累计节省108亿美元。

Conclusion: StepShield通过评估违规检测时机提供了更细粒度的安全性评估，可显著区别LLM判别器与静态分析器的性能以及带来的经济价值。

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法把LLM做为黑盒优化器，既要生成又要评估操作，缺乏对操作效用的精准估计，导致低价值操作被反复探索，缺少优先级策略。

Method: 首先将特征转换操作的提议与选择分离；LLM仅生成候选操作；通过对每个候选操作建模其效用与不确定性来指导选择。鉴于早期效用估计困难，框架设计了机制主动获取并纳入人类专家偏好反馈，以更快识别高效操作。

Result: 在合成数据和真实用户研究中，该框架相较传统方法在多种表格数据集上表现更佳，提升特征工程性能，并显著降低用户在工程过程中的思维负担。

Conclusion: 人机协作框架能提升基于LLM的表格特征工程效果，并降低用户认知负担。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

Conclusion: 子模上界可有效驱动 GFlowNet 优化，显著提升采样效率与质量，证明 SUBo-GFN 在子模奖励场景下具有实用价值

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大生态系统的LLM数量激增，传统评估和管理成本过高，需要一种快速、无训练、可扩展的方法来表征模型能力。

Method: 采用基于注意力的前向推理，通过查询编码和评估得分的编解码器生成嵌入；并训练一个判定预测器使用嵌入与查询编码进行路由。

Result: LOCUS 在实验中比基线方法减少至多4.8倍的查询评估样本量，同时在未见查询上的路由准确率领先，嵌入空间具有可解释的几何结构，可用于模型比较与聚类。

Conclusion: LOCUS 能生成低维向量嵌入，有效表示语言模型在查询上的能力，且可轻松添加或微调模型，显著提高了模型路由和对比的精度与效率。

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设因果机制在离散域间瞬时切换，无法捕捉真实系统中机制的连续演化，如车辆转弯过程或步态变化。

Method: 将过渡机制建模为有限原子机制的凸组合，使用时间变化的混合系数；通过Mixture-of-Experts框架，每个专家学习一个原子机制，训练后可推断连续混合轨迹。

Result: 在合成与真实数据实验中，TRACE的混合轨迹恢复相关性高达0.99，显著优于离散切换基线。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在连续机制过渡下潜在因果变量与混合轨迹可以共同可识别，并提出了TRACE方法，能够恢复未在训练期间观察到的中间机制状态。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

Motivation: MLIP在分子动力学中应用广泛，但受限于推理速度与显存需求，难以实现大规模、长时间仿真。


Method: 引入针对每个原子固定邻居数的动态截断，以产生稀疏原子图，随后将该方法应用于MACE、Nequip、OrbNet3、TensorNet等四种主流MLIP。

Conclusion: 动态截断技术显著降低MLIP的内存消耗与推理时间，并保持与固定截断相近的准确性。


Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

Motivation: 为了提升通用地点表示在实际使用中的准确性，填补仅靠文本元数据或轨迹上下文的缺失，缺失的 POI 功能信息显得至关重要。

Method: 提出 ME-POIs 框架：从语言模型获取的 POI 嵌入与大规模人类移动数据相结合，使用对比学习把时序化访客嵌入与可学习的 POI 表示对齐；为缓解稀疏性，利用邻近高频访问 POI 的多尺度时空模式传播机制。

Result: 在五个新设计的地图丰富任务中，ME-POIs 一致优于仅使用文本或仅使用移动数据的基线；仅用移动数据训练的 ME-POIs 在某些任务上还能超越纯文本模型，证明 POI 功能是获取准确且可泛化表征的关键。

Conclusion: 整合文本和移动数据，聚焦 POI 功能可显著提升通用地点表示性能，且多尺度传播策略有效缓解稀疏问题。

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

Motivation: 解决高维系统下连续正则化流(CNFs)在无偏玻尔兹曼采样中的可扩展性问题，主要是Jacobian行列式评估的高计算成本。

Method: 提出Flow Perturbation++，通过离散化概率流ODE，在每一步积分中执行无偏的Jacobians估计，利用多步构造实现方差减小。将该方法嵌入顺序蒙特卡罗框架。

Result: 在1000维高斯混合模型和全原子Chignolin蛋白中，相比Hutchinson估计和单步Flow Perturbation，显著提升了平衡采样效果。

Conclusion: Flow Perturbation++在保持无偏性的同时，通过多步低方差估计，提升了CNFs在高维无偏Boltzmann采样中的可扩展性。

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维生成模型常受系统性偏差影响，导致样本质量下降；传统纠错方法需要噪声注入或多步重采样，计算成本高且破坏原始采样动态。需要一种后置、无需扰动采样过程的高效偏差校正方案。

Method: BFR采用两阶段流匹配方法：1）潜在空间纠正—对近似可逆生成器进行对齐；2）数据空间纠正—在生成样本上施加轻量级数据增强，并以Deterministic correction训练。该流程不需要噪声注入或多步重采样，保留原始ODE轨迹并以单次额外NFE完成推断。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和FFHQ数据集上，BFR在BNPP样本基础上实现了一致的FID和覆盖率提升。尤其是在MNIST上，潜在空间纠正将FID从3.95提升到1.46，达到最先进水平，仅使用一次额外函数评估，且保持样本多样性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) 框架通过在潜在空间对可逆生成器进行对齐以及在数据空间进行轻量级增强的定向纠正，展示了在不扰动原有ODE轨迹的前提下，显著提升了高维场景下扩散与流式生成模型的精度与覆盖率。对MNIST、CIFAR-10和FFHQ 256×256的实验表明，BFR在保持样本多样性的同时，实现了Fidelity-1.46的最优FID，并且仅需一次额外的函数评估。

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

TL;DR: 通过剔除干扰令牌的 LENS 能有效提升 RLVR 的采样效率，取得 3.88% 的性能提升和 1.6x 的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR 在有限的 rollout 预算下存在探索低效、采样成功率低与训练不稳定的问题，原因往往不是任务难度而是少数提示令牌造成的干扰。

Method: 提出 Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS)：先识别并删除提示中的干扰令牌，然后将净化过程中的成功 rollouts 用作监督原始嘈杂提示下的策略优化，使模型学会在真实环境中忽略干扰。

Result: LENS 在实验中明显优于 GRPO，平均提升 3.88% 的性能并实现 1.6 倍以上的收敛速度提升。

Conclusion: 去噪干扰令牌能够显著提升 RLVR 的采样效率与稳定性，对 LLM 推理任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning, but remains constrained by inefficient exploration under limited rollout budgets, leading to low sampling success and unstable training in complex tasks. We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.

Conclusion: EGAM在多种路由问题上达到或超过现有方法的表现，尤其在高度受限问题上表现突出。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) solvers, implemented with graph neural networks (GNNs), have introduced new approaches for solving routing problems. Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.

Motivation: 实现可信任AI要求的LLM去学，弥补现有调优型方法计算成本高且易遗忘、以及上下文型方法易被攻击的短板。

Method: 利用提示引导的高效教师拒绝不良知识生成，随后训练学生模型对教师行为进行蒸馏，以实现对不良知识的精确去学，同时保留领域知识。

Result: 在现有基准测试和扩展评测协议下，DUET在遗忘与功能保持方面均表现更佳，且比最先进的去学方法在数据效率上提升了数倍到数十倍。

Conclusion: DUET通过教师-学生蒸馏方法实现了高效、紧凑且鲁棒的LLM去学（unlearning），在遗忘率与原有功能保持上均优于现有方法，并且在数据效率上显著领先。

Abstract: LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.

Conclusion: TimeSliver 通过原始时间序列与其符号化抽象共同构建表示，每个元素线性编码时间段贡献，从而为每个时间点分配重要性得分；在多变量时间序列分类上既提升了解释性能，又保持了与最先进基准相近的预测效果。

Abstract: Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets. TimeSliver also achieves predictive performance within 2% of state-of-the-art baselines across 26 UEA benchmark datasets, positioning it as a strong and explainable framework for general time-series classification.

Motivation: 在非平稳运行、速度/负荷/传感器跨域变化和严重类别不平衡条件下，需要既保持误报可控、可预测，又能提供物理可解释的预警信号。

Conclusion: PG‑TMT实现了可校准、可解释、易部署的旋转机械早期预警系统，显著降低误报并提升检测准确性。

Abstract: Reliability-centered prognostics for rotating machinery requires early warning signals that remain accurate under nonstationary operating conditions, domain shifts across speed/load/sensors, and severe class imbalance, while keeping the false-alarm rate small and predictable. We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.

Motivation: 多模态数据常同时缺失两视图，传统的 PLS‑SVD 在缺失情况下尚未明确其理论性能与阈值行为。

Method: 在对互相掩码后的交叉协方差做适当归一化后，将其近似为有效信号被$\sqrt{ρ}$衰减的尖峰矩形随机矩阵，随后基于随机矩阵理论推导其奇异值/向量的极限表现。

Result: 提出了信噪比临界阈值，得到不同行列比、信号强度与缺失率下的相位图与重建曲线，并在仿真与半合成实验中得到验证。

Conclusion: 本文通过分析在高维相似样本数模型下的缺失完全随机（MCAR）掩码对 PLS‑SVD 交叉协方差矩阵的影响，揭示了 PLS‑SVD 的 BBP 型相位转换特性，证明其在信噪比低于阈值时无信息，阈值以上能够实现非平凡的共享方向对齐，并给出了闭式的重叠公式。

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) seeks to create a compact dataset from a large, real-world dataset. While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm. These components ensure that the distilled dataset is both informative and utility-optimized. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 6.1\% performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art approach on ImageNet-1K dataset using ResNet-18.

Motivation: 平均奖励MDP缺乏收缩性，导致传统的非渐近分析不可行；现有方法需强假设或使用折扣/情节逼近，导致额外参数或样本复杂度子最优。

Method: 引入懒惰( lazified )动态转移，构建实例相关 seminorm，使得Bellman算子在此 seminorm 下成为一步收缩的算子，并利用此性质分析Q‑learning收敛速度。

Result: 在可达性假设与懒惰动态下，提出的同步/异步Q‑learning在\(\tilde O(\epsilon^{-2})\)步内达到\(\epsilon\)精度，且不需要未知参数或额外的折扣调整。

Conclusion: Synchronous和异步Q‑learning在平均奖励马尔可夫决策过程上，在可达性假设下可实现准最优样本复杂度\(\tilde O(\epsilon^{-2})\)。

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

Abstract: This paper investigates search in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). Conventional wisdom holds that long-term predictions and compounding errors are the primary obstacles for model-based RL. We challenge this view, showing that search is not a plug-and-play replacement for a learned policy. Surprisingly, we find that search can harm performance even when the model is highly accurate. Instead, we show that mitigating distribution shift matters more than improving model or value function accuracy. Building on this insight, we identify key techniques for enabling effective search, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple popular benchmark domains.

Abstract: The increasing scale of graph datasets has significantly improved the performance of graph representation learning methods, but it has also introduced substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation techniques have emerged to compress large datasets into smaller yet information-rich datasets, while maintaining similar test performance. However, these methods strictly require downstream applications to match the original dataset and task, which often fails in cross-task and cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel causal-invariance-based and transferable graph dataset condensation method, named \textbf{TGCC}, providing effective and transferable condensed datasets. Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a statistical learning problem when the distribution of training (source) data is different from that of test (target) data. In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments under various distribution shift scenarios show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, especially when target data are extremely scarce.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a transformative solution to alleviate urban congestion by utilizing low-altitude airspace, thereby reducing pressure on ground transportation networks. To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems. This work lays a solid foundation for advancing intelligent urban mobility solutions through the coordination of air and ground transportation modes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a new convex loss for SVMs, both for the binary classification and for the regression models. Therefore, we show the mathematical derivation of the dual problems and we experiment them with several small data-sets. The minimal dimension of those data-sets is due to the difficult scalability of the SVM method to bigger instances. This preliminary study should prove that using pattern correlations inside the loss function could enhance the generalisation performances. Coherently, results show that generalisation measures are never worse than the standard losses and several times they are better. In our opinion, it should be considered a careful study of this loss, coupled with shallow and deep neural networks. In fact, we present some novel results obtained with those architectures.

Abstract: Controlling memorization in diffusion models is critical for applications that require generated data to closely match the training distribution. Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型易受与人类标签因果无关的伪特征影响，导致奖励黑客和行为不一致。

Method: 使用因果因子和非因果因子对上下文嵌入进行分解，仅让奖励头关注因果因子；同时加入对抗头预测非因果因子奖励，并通过梯度反转抑制非因果因子携带奖励信息。

Conclusion: 通过因果分解与对抗学习，本文提出的奖励模型在RLHF中更鲁棒，显著减轻奖励欺骗与长度/奴性偏差等问题。

Abstract: A reliable reward model is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences through reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component. In addition, we introduce an adversarial head trained to predict reward from the non-causal factors, while applying gradient reversal to discourage them from encoding reward-relevant information. Experiments on both mathematical and dialogue tasks demonstrate that our method learns more robust reward models and consistently improves downstream RLHF performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses on length and sycophantic bias further validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating reward hacking behaviors.

TL;DR: 对LLM解码器的Attention‑FFN去聚合架构提供了可解析的资源比例优化方法，该方法能在理论与仿真上实现接近最佳吞吐并显著降低空闲。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM解码中，Attention 与 FFN 两部分需要独立扩展内存与计算资源；然而错误的 A/F 设定会导致按步阻塞与高空闲，显著影响系统吞吐。为解决此资源商榷问题，提出可解析的资源分配指导方针。

Method: 构建了一个概率工作负载模型，对 Attention 侧非平稳（基于 token 的上下文增大）与 FFN 侧稳定的特性进行建模，随后推导出闭式最优 A/F 比率公式，并采用统一的 Trace‑校准 AFD 仿真器对理论结果进行验证。

Result: 理论计算得到的最优 A/F 比率在10%以内与仿真得到的最优值一致，且在不同工作负载下持续减少设备空闲时间。

Conclusion: 通过针对 rA-1F 拓扑的可计算分析框架，阐明了 Attention‑FFN 去聚合（AFD）系统中 Attention 与 FFN 资源比例（A/F 比率）的最优配置，并证明了该比例可显著提升吞吐量、降低设备空闲时间。

Abstract: Attention-FFN disaggregation (AFD) is an emerging architecture for LLM decoding that separates state-heavy, KV-cache-dominated Attention computation from stateless, compute-intensive FFN computation, connected by per-step communication. While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system. A trace-calibrated AFD simulator validates the theory: across workloads, the theoretical optimal A/F ratio matches the simulation-optimal within 10%, and consistently reduces idle time.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a principled approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions, with Expected Improvement (EI) being one of the most widely used acquisition functions. Despite its empirical success, EI is known to be overly exploitative and can converge to suboptimal stationary points. We propose Expected Improvement via Gradient Norms (EI-GN), a novel acquisition function that applies the improvement principle to a gradient-aware auxiliary objective, thereby promoting sampling in regions that are both high-performing and approaching first-order stationarity. EI-GN relies on gradient observations used to learn gradient-enhanced surrogate models that enable principled gradient inference from function evaluations. We derive a tractable closed-form expression for EI-GN that allows efficient optimization and show that the proposed acquisition is consistent with the improvement-based acquisition framework. Empirical evaluations on standard BO benchmarks demonstrate that EI-GN yields consistent improvements against standard baselines. We further demonstrate applicability of EI-GN to control policy learning problems.

Abstract: The forward pass of a Transformer can be seen as an interacting particle system on the unit sphere: time plays the role of layers, particles that of token embeddings, and the unit sphere idealizes layer normalization. In some weight settings the system can even be seen as a gradient flow for an explicit energy, and one can make sense of the infinite context length (mean-field) limit thanks to Wasserstein gradient flows. In this paper we study the effect of the perceptron block in this setting, and show that critical points are generically atomic and localized on subsets of the sphere.

Abstract: Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.
  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its performance in real-world scenarios is further validated using a private dataset collected by ourselves, which contains the test items' information on laptop motherboards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在奖励稀疏的强化学习环境中，传统的探索策略（如噪声注入）往往无法充分引导智能体学习有效策略。内在奖励可为探索提供理论指导，但结合外在奖励的做法会出现不稳定的信用分配，而仅利用内在奖励训练子策略则导致样本效率低下与次优。

Method: 提出多重内在奖励策略优化（IRPO）框架，直接利用多个内在奖励对主策略进行优化，无需预训练子策略。IRPO采用 surrogate policy gradient 给予更具信息量的学习信号，专门针对稀疏奖励环境改进学习过程。

Result: 在离散和连续两类任务中，IRPO 相较基线显著提升了性能和样本效率，并对其所优化的问题进行了形式化分析。

Conclusion: IRPO 成功解决了稀疏奖励环境下信用分配不稳定与样本低效的问题，证明了多重内在奖励直观优化主策略的有效性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in reinforcement learning as an agent relies on trial and error to learn an optimal policy. However, when rewards are sparse, naive exploration strategies, like noise injection, are often insufficient. Intrinsic rewards can also provide principled guidance for exploration by, for example, combining them with extrinsic rewards to optimize a policy or using them to train subpolicies for hierarchical learning. However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies. Our algorithm -- intrinsic reward policy optimization (IRPO) -- achieves this by using a surrogate policy gradient that provides a more informative learning signal than the true gradient in sparse-reward environments. We demonstrate that IRPO improves performance and sample efficiency relative to baselines in discrete and continuous environments, and formally analyze the optimization problem solved by IRPO.

Motivation: 现有做法对过度“深度思考”的现象处理不足，缺少对任务难度的感知，导致在简单任务上产生冗长推理和资源浪费。

Method: 基于强化学习的训练框架，将任务难度建模与奖励函数结合，使用自我推理的难度信号来反映任务复杂度，并在奖励中加入推理长度惩罚。

Result: 在实验中，DiPO显著降低了冗余token的比例，同时保持甚至提升了推理效果，证明任务难度感知与奖励调节的有效性。

Conclusion: DiPO使得大型推理模型在调节推理资源时能够自发识别任务难度，从而显著减少冗余推理而不损失性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve explicit chain-of-thought expansion by imitating deep thinking behaviors of humans, demonstrating excellent performance in complex task scenarios. However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format. Experimental results indicate that DiPO enables the model to spontaneously adjust inference overhead, significantly reducing redundant tokens without losing performance due to thought compression.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在高维数据上对预测目标的选择缺乏正式理论说明，且传统方式缺少自动化手段来确定最佳目标。

Method: 构建一种通用预测形式，推导出数据几何与最佳预测目标的解析关系；设计k-Diff算法，利用数据驱动方法学习最优k参数，避免显式估计内在维数；在潜在空间和像素空间图像生成任务上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: k-Diff在多种架构与数据规模下，均优于固定目标的基线，体现了理论指导下的数据驱动自动化预测目标选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 在高维情境下，直接预测数据x在数据几何与内在维数关系上优于噪声或速度预测，并且可以通过适当的k参数自动化选择最佳目标；k-Diff框架在多种架构和数据规模下显著提升生成性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion and flow matching models have highlighted a shift in the preferred prediction target -- moving from noise ($\varepsilon$) and velocity (v) to direct data (x) prediction -- particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.

Abstract: Large language models allocate uniform computation across all tokens, ignoring that some sequences are trivially predictable while others require deep reasoning. We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\times$ and KV cache by $R\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\% and decoding speedups up to 117\% on long sequences. The minimal architectural modifications enable straightforward integration into existing MoE, demonstrating that adaptive concept-level processing fundamentally improves both effectiveness and efficiency of large language models.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正被用于时间序列分析，但跨模态时间错位和语义纠缠严重阻碍了精确理解；迫切需要改进对齐与分离机制。

Method: 1) Patch‑level Alignment：在物理层面对齐不同模态的细粒度片段；2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction：将共性语义压缩为离散潜在空间，提炼出专属信息并动态融合；3) Critical‑token Highlighting：突出查询相关的重要 token，增强推理鲁棒性。

Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.

TL;DR: SAGE通过自适应梯度与序列级信号解耦，改进生成式列表推荐，消除词典依赖，解决冷启动与多样性失衡，兼顾数值稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文指出，现有的十字推荐系统如OneRec虽然验证了大型语言模型（LLM）的扩展性，但依赖繁琐的单独词典，导致无法重用原生LLM词汇表，维护成本高且扩展性差；另外，OneRec的GBPO优化策略存在“对称保守性”问题，静态梯度边界抑制冷启动物品的更新动力，并在高噪声环境下导致多样性崩塌。

Method: 为解决上述问题，作者提出SAGE（Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution），一种面向列表级生成式推荐的统一优化框架。SAGE包含两项创新：(1) 序列级信号解耦：采用几何平均重要性比率与解耦多目标优势相结合，消除词级方差，避免奖励坍塌；(2) 非对称自适应动力学：构建动态梯度流形，对高潜力冷启动项应用增益因子实现超线性更新，并通过熵感知惩罚打破信息茧房。

Result: 理论分析与实证实验表明，SAGE能够有效解锁冷启动流量，保持推荐多样性，同时保持GBPO的数值稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE为LLM在推荐系统中的高效复用提供了可行路径，解决了词典依赖和梯度静态限制，提升了冷启动性能和多样性保障，并保持优化稳定。

Abstract: While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a "Symmetric Conservatism" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the "Reward Collapse" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a "Boost Factor" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an "Entropy Aware Penalty" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.

Abstract: LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: L$^3$提供了一种新的稀疏化方式，显著提升了稠密模型和传统基于MoE稀疏模型的语言建模及下游任务效果。

Abstract: Modern sparse language models typically achieve sparsity through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, which dynamically route tokens to dense MLP "experts." However, dynamic hard routing has a number of drawbacks, such as potentially poor hardware efficiency and needing auxiliary losses for stable training. In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.

Motivation: 在被多个答案认可的任务（如自然语言生成）中，只能获得单一正确标注，如何在此“部分反馈”环境下进行高效学习成为关键。

Method: 通过构造新的版本空间视角引入 PFLdim 并利用辅助维数证明其决定确定性学习者的可学习性；随后引入 PMSdim 推导随机学习者的紧确上限；进一步利用 Helly 数和嵌套标签结构说明确定性与随机性学习可分离性。

Conclusion: 本文为部分反馈在线学习提供了几乎完整的极大极小遗憾分析，并确立了新的复杂度量——部分反馈 Littlestone 维数和部分反馈 Measure Shattering 维数；此外指出在集合可实现性之外，问题会变得不可降维，线性遗憾可能出现。

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种可泛化的BCD框架，涵盖常用梯度/近似Newton更新，应用于Graphical Lasso，显著提升收敛效率，迭代次数可减少至原来的1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BCD理论主要聚焦凸问题，缺乏针对非凸组合优化的系统研究；需要解决稀疏精度矩阵估计的高效迭代。

Method: 设计可包容变量度量原近梯度、原近牛顿与交替最小化的BCD框架，并应用于Graphical Lasso的三种实现。

Conclusion: 提出通用BCD框架，能保证目标下降并收敛到可行解；在稀疏精度矩阵估计中实现迭代次数大幅降低。

Abstract: Block-coordinate descent (BCD) is the method of choice to solve numerous large scale optimization problems, however their theoretical study for non-convex optimization, has received less attention. In this paper, we present a new block-coordinate descent (BCD) framework to tackle non-convex composite optimization problems, ensuring decrease of the objective function and convergence to a solution. This framework is general enough to include variable metric proximal gradient updates, proximal Newton updates, and alternated minimization updates. This generality allows to encompass three versions of the most used solvers in the sparse precision matrix estimation problem, deemed Graphical Lasso: graphical ISTA, Primal GLasso, and QUIC. We demonstrate the value of this new framework on non-convex sparse precision matrix estimation problems, providing convergence guarantees and up to a $100$-fold reduction in the number of iterations required to reach state-of-the-art estimation quality.

### [125] [PPI-SVRG: Unifying Prediction-Powered Inference and Variance Reduction for Semi-Supervised Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21470)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Haoyang Liu,David Simchi-Levi,Will Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPI-SVRG blends prediction and gradient variance reduction, matching SVRG under perfect predictions and still improving performance under label scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data is scarce while pre-trained model predictions are available; existing methods like PPI and SVRG reduce variance separately. The goal is to combine them to exploit both sources for efficient learning.

Method: Semi-supervised stochastic optimization using PPI (prediction-based control variates) and SVRG (reference gradient control variates) is unified mathematically; the resulting PPI-SVRG algorithm applies both variance reduction techniques and derives convergence rates decomposed into SVRG-like terms plus a prediction-error floor.

Result: Theoretical analysis gives a convergence bound that recovers SVRG with perfect predictions and degrades gracefully; empirical tests show 43–52% MSE improvement on mean estimation and 2.7–2.9% accuracy gain on MNIST with only 10% labels.

Conclusion: PPI-SVRG, a combination of prediction-based variance reduction and SVRG's control variate, achieves convergence bounds equivalent to SVRG with an additional error floor determined by prediction uncertainty, yielding robust performance even with imperfect predictions.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 RL 后训练对齐技术虽效果好，但训练成本高、过程复杂、面临不稳定性问题，迫切需要一种不依赖额外训练、成本低且推理稳定的方法。

Method: 本工作提出 Energy‑Guided Test‑Time Scaling（ETS）算法，直接从最优 RL 策略抽样。其核心思想是构造 Masked Language Modeling（MLM）的转移概率为参考策略模型与能量项的组合，使用在线 Monte Carlo 估计能量，并通过定制的 Importance Sampling 与现代加速框架对推理过程进行优化，从而在保持采样质量的前提下显著降低推理时延。

Result: 在包含自回归模型与扩散语言模型的 MLM 任务上，ETS 在 reasoning、coding、science 等基准测试中，一贯提升了生成质量，并在推理速度上实现显著加速，实验结果验证了该方法的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ETS 在无需额外训练的前提下，提供了稳定且高效的 RL 关联语言模型推理方法，显著提升了生成质量并降低了推理延迟。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training alignment for language models is effective, but also costly and unstable in practice, owing to its complicated training process. To address this, we propose a training-free inference method to sample directly from the optimal RL policy. The transition probability applied to Masked Language Modeling (MLM) consists of a reference policy model and an energy term. Based on this, our algorithm, Energy-Guided Test-Time Scaling (ETS), estimates the key energy term via online Monte Carlo, with a provable convergence rate. Moreover, to ensure practical efficiency, ETS leverages modern acceleration frameworks alongside tailored importance sampling estimators, substantially reducing inference latency while provably preserving sampling quality. Experiments on MLM (including autoregressive models and diffusion language models) across reasoning, coding, and science benchmarks show that our ETS consistently improves generation quality, validating its effectiveness and design.

Motivation: 现有解码与不确定性估计方法仅关注语言空间，忽略了自然语言响应中潜在的离散标签、数值或图形结构；需在结构层面直接建模以获得更佳结果与对齐。

Method: 通过为潜在结构引入不相似度度量，将LLM生成的结果映射到该空间，利用贝叶斯风险推导出最优回应，然后合成新的回应；同时利用该框架对输出的不确定性进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，在不同任务中，贝叶斯最优回答一致优于beam search等传统方法；并且基于潜在结构的风险估计更好地与输出质量和正确性对齐。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种在潜在结构空间中对LLM输出进行建模并基于贝叶斯风险计算最优回答的决策理论框架，能够在多个任务上超越传统解码方法并实现更可靠的结构感知预测。

Abstract: In many applications of LLMs, natural language responses often have an underlying structure such as representing discrete labels, numerical values, or graphs. Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space. Across different tasks, Bayes-optimal responses consistently outperform standard decoding methods like beam search. Moreover, quantifying uncertainty via the induced Bayesian risk captures variations in terms of the latent structure and improves alignment with output quality and correctness. Our decision-theoretic framework is applicable to any problem that admits a latent response structure and enables reliable task-aware LLM predictions.

Abstract: Many-Task Learning refers to the setting where a large number of related tasks need to be learned, the exact relationships between tasks are not known. We introduce the Cascaded Transfer Learning, a novel many-task transfer learning paradigm where information (e.g. model parameters) cascades hierarchically through tasks that are learned by individual models of the same class, while respecting given budget constraints. The cascade is organized as a rooted tree that specifies the order in which tasks are learned and refined. We design a cascaded transfer mechanism deployed over a minimum spanning tree structure that connects the tasks according to a suitable distance measure, and allocates the available training budget along its branches. Experiments on synthetic and real many-task settings show that the resulting method enables more accurate and cost effective adaptation across large task collections compared to alternative approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG SPD处理中缺乏对嵌入方式如何影响梯度收敛与数值稳定性的理论解释，需要将理论与实践结合。

Method: 通过 Daleckii‑Kreĭn 矩阵分析梯度条件化，使用 bi‑Lipschitz 约束证明BWSPD保持距離；嵌入空间 BN 进行近似；在统一 Transformer 框架下对 BWSPD、Log‑Euclidean 与 Euclidean 进行 1500+ 次实验，验证理论。

Result: Log‑Euclidean Transformer 在三种 EEG 范式上均实现最优性能；BWSPD 效果与理论一致，训练时间相近；BN‑Embed 在 56 通道 ERP 上提升 26% 准确率，低通道 SSVEP 效果微弱。

Conclusion: 本文在SPD流形上建立了嵌入几何与优化动力学的理论联系，证明BWSPD在高维输入下提供更优梯度条件化，并保留流形距离；嵌入空间BN可近似Riemannian归一化。

Abstract: Spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals are Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) and lie on a Riemannian manifold, yet the theoretical connection between embedding geometry and optimization dynamics remains unexplored. We provide a formal analysis linking embedding choice to gradient conditioning and numerical stability for SPD manifolds, establishing three theoretical results: (1) BWSPD's $\sqrtκ$ gradient conditioning (vs $κ$ for Log-Euclidean) via Daleckii-Kreĭn matrices provides better gradient conditioning on high-dimensional inputs ($d \geq 22$), with this advantage reducing on low-dimensional inputs ($d \leq 8$) where eigendecomposition overhead dominates; (2) Embedding-Space Batch Normalization (BN-Embed) approximates Riemannian normalization up to $O(\varepsilon^2)$ error, yielding $+26\%$ accuracy on 56-channel ERP data but negligible effect on 8-channel SSVEP data, matching the channel-count-dependent prediction; (3) bi-Lipschitz bounds prove BWSPD tokens preserve manifold distances with distortion governed solely by the condition ratio $κ$. We validate these predictions via a unified Transformer framework comparing BWSPD, Log-Euclidean, and Euclidean embeddings within identical architecture across 1,500+ runs on three EEG paradigms (motor imagery, ERP, SSVEP; 36 subjects). Our Log-Euclidean Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, substantially outperforming classical Riemannian classifiers and recent SPD baselines, while BWSPD offers competitive accuracy with similar training time.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

Abstract: To promote cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, the reward signals of all agents can be aggregated together, forming global rewards that are commonly known as the fully cooperative setting. However, global rewards are usually noisy because they contain the contributions of all agents, which have to be resolved in the credit assignment process. On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph. Our experiments demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, enabling improvements over the traditional local and global reward settings.

TL;DR: 该论文针对多模态时序预测中token融合难题，引入以文本为驱动的MoE专家调制方法，既提升了模型对跨模态信息的利用，又在实验中证明了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界时序数据呈现复杂且不断演进的动态，准确预测极具挑战。现有多模态预测方法利用文本信息（如新闻）改进预测，往往依赖在共享表征空间中混合时序补丁与语言标记的基于token的融合，但当高质量时序-文本对稀缺，或时序尺度和特性差异显著时，这种融合不易对齐，效果受限。

Method: 我们提出Expert Modulation框架：在Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）架构中，将路由决策和专家计算均条件化于文本信号，实现对专家行为的直接且高效的跨模态控制，避免传统token级融合带来的对齐和尺度问题。

Result: 通过详尽的理论分析与广泛实验，Expert Modulation在多模态时序预测任务上相较于传统token融合方法取得显著性能提升。代码已公开(https://github.com/BruceZhangReve/MoME)。

Conclusion: 对时序与文本的交叉控制通过专家调制显著缓解了跨模态不匹配与规模差异的困扰，展示了该方法在复杂时序预测中的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

Conclusion: HistoPrism 成为使用常规 H&E 病理切片预测跨癌症基因表达的新的行业标准，具备优秀的跨癌症泛化性与生物学一致性；

Abstract: Predicting spatial gene expression from H&E histology offers a scalable and clinically accessible alternative to sequencing, but realizing clinical impact requires models that generalize across cancer types and capture biologically coherent signals. Prior work is often limited to per-cancer settings and variance-based evaluation, leaving functional relevance underexplored. We introduce HistoPrism, an efficient transformer-based architecture for pan-cancer prediction of gene expression from histology. To evaluate biological meaning, we introduce a pathway-level benchmark, shifting assessment from isolated gene-level variance to coherent functional pathways. HistoPrism not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art models on highly variable genes , but also more importantly, achieves substantial gains on pathway-level prediction, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically coherent transcriptomic patterns. With strong pan-cancer generalization and improved efficiency, HistoPrism establishes a new standard for clinically relevant transcriptomic modeling from routinely available histology.

Conclusion: FlexCausal通过块对角协方差VAE和因子化流式先验，在复杂非高斯噪声背景下实现了更高质量的因果可分解表示，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Causal Disentangled Representation Learning(CDRL) aims to learn and disentangle low dimensional representations and their underlying causal structure from observations. However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations. Finally, we introduce a manifold-aware relative intervention strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexCausal significantly outperforms other methods.

Conclusion: 提供了一个统一框架，用可用信息度量表示之间的相似性，并阐明了功能相似性、表征相似性以及两者的层次关系。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for quantifying the similarity between representations through the lens of \textit{usable information}, offering a rigorous theoretical and empirical synthesis across three key dimensions. First, addressing functional similarity, we establish a formal link between stitching performance and conditional mutual information. We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one. Third, we demonstrate that representational similarity is sufficient but not necessary for functional similarity. We unify these concepts through a task-granularity hierarchy: similarity on a complex task guarantees similarity on any coarser derivative, establishing representational similarity as the limit of maximum granularity: input reconstruction.

Motivation: 传统的降解语言模型不良能力的手段多在后处理阶段，易被对抗者绕过。该研究旨在探索在预训练阶段通过过滤数据来塑造模型能力，提升抵御能力。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对token进行标签，结合低成本高质量的分类器进行过滤；对比token层与文档层过滤。

Result: token过滤比文档过滤更具成本效益；在规模增大时效果更佳；在最大模型中，token过滤导致在忘却域的算力下降达7000x，但训练后仍可在该域对齐；过滤对噪声标签鲁棒，需足够的预训练算力。

Conclusion: 在预训练阶段对数据（尤其是token）进行过滤是一种高效、低成本且可扩展的手段，可显著削弱语言模型在医学领域的非期望能力。

Abstract: Current approaches to reducing undesired capabilities in language models are largely post hoc, and can thus be easily bypassed by adversaries. A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers. We also demonstrate that filtering can be robust to noisy labels with sufficient pretraining compute.

Abstract: Recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) are a promising substrate for energy-efficient control policies, but training them for high-dimensional, long-horizon reinforcement learning remains challenging. Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting during knowledge injection severely undermines the continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.

To extend BatchEnsemble to sequential modeling, we introduce GRUBE, a novel BatchEnsemble GRU cell. We compare the BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensemble models. Our results show that BatchEnsemble matches the uncertainty estimation performance of deep ensembles, and clearly outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better performance in both prediction and uncertainty estimation. These findings show that BatchEnsemble and GRUBE achieve similar performance with fewer parameters and reduced training and inference time compared to traditional ensembles.

Abstract: Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: 本研究展示了通过无训练且无验证器的算法，在消除迭代MCMC的同时，能够实现与RL后训练相当甚至更好的推理性能，并显著降低推理时延。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is a dominant approach for improving the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet growing evidence suggests that its gains arise primarily from distribution sharpening rather than the acquisition of new capabilities. Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.

Result: 实验结果表明，T2在保持性能接近全局并行思考的同时，显著降低了算力和时间成本。

Conclusion: T2方法显著降低成本，同时保持与传统全局并行思考相当的性能，成功破解了过度并行导致的预算浪费现象。

Abstract: Parallel thinking enhances LLM reasoning by multi-path sampling and aggregation. In system-level evaluations, a global parallelism level N is allocated to all samples, typically set large to maximize overall dataset accuracy. However, due to sample heterogeneity, some samples can achieve comparable performance with a smaller N'< N, causing budget redundancy. This incompatibility between system-level efficacy and sample-level efficiency constitutes the overscaling curse. In this paper, we formalize and quantify the overscaling curse, showing its universality and severity in practice, and analyze its trigger mechanism. We then propose a lightweight method, T2, to break the overscaling curse, which utilizes latent representations to estimate the optimal parallelism level for each sample before decoding. Experiments show that T2 significantly reduces cost while maintaining comparable performance, enabling more efficient parallel thinking.

Abstract: Mixed-precision computations are a hallmark of the current stage of AI, driving the progress in large language models towards efficient, locally deployable solutions. This article addresses the floating-point computation of compositionally-rich functions, concentrating on transformer inference. Based on the rounding error analysis of a composition $f(g(\mathrm{x}))$, we provide an adaptive strategy that selects a small subset of components of $g(\mathrm{x})$ to be computed more accurately while all other computations can be carried out with lower accuracy. We then explain how this strategy can be applied to different compositions within a transformer and illustrate its overall effect on transformer inference. We study the effectiveness of this algorithm numerically on GPT-2 models and demonstrate that already very low recomputation rates allow for improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in accuracy.

Abstract: Modern deep-learning training is not memoryless. Updates depend on optimizer moments and averaging, data-order policies (random reshuffling vs with-replacement, staged augmentations and replay), the nonconvex path, and auxiliary state (teacher EMA/SWA, contrastive queues, BatchNorm statistics). This survey organizes mechanisms by source, lifetime, and visibility. It introduces seed-paired, function-space causal estimands; portable perturbation primitives (carry/reset of momentum/Adam/EMA/BN, order-window swaps, queue/teacher tweaks); and a reporting checklist with audit artifacts (order hashes, buffer/BN checksums, RNG contracts). The conclusion is a protocol for portable, causal, uncertainty-aware measurement that attributes how much training history matters across models, data, and regimes.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for ship propeller design. While traditional forward machine learning models predict the performance of mechanical components based on given design parameters, GenAI models aim to generate designs that achieve specified performance targets. In particular, we employ conditional flow matching to establish a bidirectional mapping between design parameters and simulated noise that is conditioned on performance labels. This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector.
  To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data. We further propose data augmentation using pseudo-labels derived from less data-intensive forward surrogate models, which can often improve overall model performance. Finally, we present examples of distinct propeller geometries that exhibit nearly identical performance characteristics, illustrating the versatility and potential of GenAI in engineering design.

TL;DR: Segment‑wise MoE layers significantly improve long‑term time‑series forecasting by exploiting temporal locality, outperforming prior token‑wise and dense Transformer baselines.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models excel at time‑series forecasting but struggle to scale for long horizons.  Existing MoE variants use token‑wise routing, ignoring the natural segmental locality of temporal data.


Method: Introduce Seg‑MoE, a sparse MoE layer that routes contiguous time‑step segments to experts, enabling intra‑segment interaction modeling.


Result: Seg‑MoE, embedded in a Transformer, achieves state‑of‑the‑art accuracy on multiple multivariate long‑term benchmarks, surpassing dense Transformers and token‑wise MoE models. Ablations confirm segment‑level routing as the key contributor.


Conclusion: Aligning MoE routing granularity with the inherent temporal structure unlocks a powerful inductive bias, demonstrating the potential of conditionally sparse architectures for sequential data.


Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently made significant advances in accurate time-series forecasting, but even these architectures struggle to scale efficiently while capturing long-term temporal dynamics. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.

Conclusion: 采用仓库中心学习（RCL）可显著提升小型语言模型在复杂、未知代码库中的推理效果；相比任务中心学习，RCL在训练样本效率和推理成本上更具优势。

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

Motivation: VLM缺乏内在的不确定性量化机制，需要一种理论基础强、计算可行的评估方法来捕捉模型的知识缺陷。

Method: 利用负对数密度作为不确定性的近似指标，在VLM嵌入的超球面流形上采用Riemannian流匹配计算概率密度。

Result: 实验表明REPVLM与预测误差高度相关，远优于现有基线，并在分类、OOD检测和自动数据清洗等应用中表现出良好表现。

Conclusion: 本文阐述了一种基于Riemannian Flow Matching的置信度度量方法REPVLM，并证明其在知识不确定性评估以及OOD检测等任务上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are typically deterministic in nature and lack intrinsic mechanisms to quantify epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the model's lack of knowledge or ignorance of its own representations. We theoretically motivate negative log-density of an embedding as a proxy for the epistemic uncertainty, where low-density regions signify model ignorance. The proposed method REPVLM computes the probability density on the hyperspherical manifold of the VLM embeddings using Riemannian Flow Matching. We empirically demonstrate that REPVLM achieves near-perfect correlation between uncertainty and prediction error, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Beyond classification, we also demonstrate that the model also provides a scalable metric for out-of-distribution detection and automated data curation.

Result: 在MODIS植被指数重建实验中，SENDAI在六大全球地点、多个季节周期上均超越传统及高频基线，最大SSIM提升185%，相对现有高频方法提升36%；在边界、子季节动力学和诊断结构方面展现显著优势。

Conclusion: SENDAI提供了在传感器数据稀缺且目标域存在分布偏移的情况下，利用模拟先验与学习矫正实现全空间状态重建的高效框架，展示了优越的性能，具备轻量化、可操作性和实时监测控制的潜力。

Abstract: Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.

Motivation: 多RL问题可接受多种高质量终点，但标准RL算法往往收敛到少数几种结果，传统解释为探索不足或正则化弱，而作者认为这源自期望回报目标本身导致的结构性模式坍塌。

Method: 提出逆概率缩放作为对期望回报目标的最小修正，移除期望中的概率乘子，从而改变学习动力学；在Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）中实现IPS-GRPO，无需额外模型或架构修改；通过理论证明保证奖励成比例的终端分布。

Result: 在推理与分子生成等多种任务上，IPS-GRPO在匹配或超过基准性能的同时，显著降低了终点层级的模式坍塌。

Conclusion: 本文证明了传统基于期望回报优化的RL算法在多模态目标设置下不可避免地导致模式坍塌，并提出通过逆概率缩放（Inverse Probability Scaling）来修正学习目标，从而实现奖励成比例的终端分布，避免坍塌；在GRPO框架中实现的IPS-GRPO在多任务实验中显著减轻了模式坍塌，并保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) problems admit multiple terminal solutions of comparable quality, where the goal is not to identify a single optimum but to represent a diverse set of high-quality outcomes. Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to map independent factors of variation to independent representation components. On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.
  We introduce \textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\mathcal{T}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.
  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}{github.com/ICML26-anon/XFactors}.

Conclusion: 提出了统一的模型合并理论框架，并给出可操作的专家 fine‑tune 指导，显著提升在异质超参环境下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Model merging efficiently aggregates capabilities from multiple fine-tuned models into a single one, operating purely in parameter space without original data or expensive re-computation. Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline. Extensive experiments on the ResNet/Vit family across 20/8 visual classification tasks, involving thousands of finetuning models, robustly confirm the impact of different hyperparameters on the generalization of $\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$ predicted by our theoretical results.

Motivation: 探讨课程学习（Curriculum Learning）通过改变预训练数据顺序是否会改变学习轨迹，或仅仅重新安排对固定轨迹的曝光

Method: 在 Pythia（14M–410M 参数）模型上使用 300B 令牌，分别套用三种基于语言学的课程（获得年龄、词频、动词变形）与随机排列；在 1B 参数规模下比较随机与 Verb Variation；分析训练过程中隐式阶段、梯度噪声、输出头光谱饱和与准确率，并基于梯度方差控制进行理想化分析

Result: 不同排序共经历相同的潜在阶段，主要差异表现在阶段内的数据暴露。小模型中随机排序呈现更高梯度噪声、晚期输出头饱和度更强、最终准确率更低；课程学习在等量计算下显著降低这些影响。随着模型规模增大，饱和差异减小，课程收益缩小。研究揭示困难节奏和优化稳定性之间的联系

Conclusion: 课程学习通过在阶段内稳定优化来提升表现，而非通过创造新的训练阶段；实务建议是使用课程来降低梯度方差、提升训练稳定性

Abstract: Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.

TL;DR: 研究发现RM方法不仅能忘记信息，还能通过目标向量调控模型的高级行为与能力，这既可能带来风险，也可用于提升模型功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RM方法中目标向量的作用尚不明确，缺乏对其潜在控制与风险的深入理解。

Method: 在RM框架下，识别一维高阶概念向量，并在忘记样本的表示空间中对其进行线性操作，以实现对模型行为与能力的可控改造。

Result: 在多任务实验中验证了该假设，展示了通过RM实现对模型真值、情感、拒绝等行为的控制，以及模型上下文学习能力的提升。

Conclusion: 通过线性表示假设，研究揭示了代表性误导(RM)方法在实现模型忘却的同时，可通过目标向量控制隐藏的高阶特征，实现可控行为与能力提升。

Abstract: We consider representation misdirection (RM), a class of LLM unlearning methods that achieves forgetting by manipulating the forget-representations, that is, latent representations of forget samples. Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability). Our findings reveal that this fairly attractive phenomenon could be either a hidden risk if misused or a mechanism that can be harnessed for developing models that require stronger capabilities and controllable behaviors.

Motivation: 解释PIDM优于BC的机制，并评估其样本效率

Method: 理论分析与实验比较，建立预测器偏差条件并验证两组任务

Result: 理论证明PIDM可低于BC且差距随额外数据源增大；实验显示二维任务BC需5倍演示，平均3倍；三维高维视觉环境BC需66%更多样本

Conclusion: PIDM通过平衡预测偏差与方差，优于传统BC，尤其在专家演示有限时更有效

Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a practical offline imitation learning method, but it often fails when expert demonstrations are limited. Recent works have introduced a class of architectures named predictive inverse dynamics models (PIDM) that combine a future state predictor with an inverse dynamics model (IDM). While PIDM often outperforms BC, the reasons behind its benefits remain unclear. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation: PIDM introduces a bias-variance tradeoff. While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\% more samples than PIDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Wishart随机性是否足以保障隐私，尤其在机器学习微调（LoRA）场景下探讨低秩投影对隐私的影响。

Method: 构造随机映射 $S\mapsto M f(S)$，其中 $M\sim W_d(1/r I_d,r)$，并对无噪声与噪声两种情形分别进行非渐近DP分析和实验评估。

Result: 向量查询可得非渐近DP保证；矩阵查询无噪声时失效，并出现高AUC的成员推断攻击；引入噪声后，机制在大/小秩下呈现隐私放大效果；LoRA实例化为矩阵查询机制，显示其非隐私性。

Conclusion: Wishart投影机制在无噪声情况下对向量查询可满足DP，矩阵查询则不行，但加入噪声后可实现更强隐私；LoRA更新并非天然私有，低秩微调可在相同噪声水平下增强隐私。

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

<details>

Motivation: 传统PFN缺乏可解释的先验与核模型，难以用于需要显式协方差的后续任务；需要一种透明且高效的谱发现方式。

Method: 先从PFN的注意力潜变量中提取观测函数与谱结构的中介关系；构造解码器将PFN潜变量映射为谱密度估计，再利用布朗回推将其转化为stationary核；在单/多样本情形下分析谱可识别性与一致性。

Result: 解码器能够重建复杂的多峰谱混合，得到的核支持高斯过程回归，精度与PFN及优化基线相当，但仅需一次前向推断，推断速度提升数百倍。

Conclusion: PFNs的可解释解码结构可以从预训练的PFN中提取显式谱密度和相关核，满足下游需要显式协方差模型的任务，并在单向前向推断中显著加速。

Abstract: Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) enable efficient amortized inference but lack transparent access to their learned priors and kernels. This opacity hinders their use in downstream tasks, such as surrogate-based optimization, that require explicit covariance models. We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习优化混合精度量化，可显著提升CIM加速器的效率，实现高精度与高速的兼顾。

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) accelerators are a promising solution for accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads, as they perform Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs) on crossbar arrays directly in memory. Although the bit widths of the crossbar inputs and cells are very limited, most CIM compilers do not support quantization below 8 bit. As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy. In the best case, our approach achieves up to a 2.48x speedup over existing state-of-the-art solutions, with an accuracy loss of only 0.086 %.

Method: 形式化梯度尺度不变性概念，并证明仅当β1=β2时Adam成为一阶尺度不变的优化器；通过实验验证该结论

Result: 实验表明在β1=β2取值下，对梯度的缩放对更新的影响更平滑，验证了理论预测；该结论与多种新优化器的设计原则相一致

Conclusion: β1=β2的设置可被视为实现梯度尺度不变性的关键，提供了一条设计未来优化器的简单原则

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

Abstract: Sepsis remains one of the most complex and heterogeneous syndromes in intensive care, characterized by diverse physiological trajectories and variable responses to treatment. While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to "flatten" the data. Finally, the flattened data is classified using a selective naive Bayesian classifier. Experimental validation demonstrates the relevance of the suggested approach as well as its extreme interpretability. The interpretation is fourfold: univariate, global, local, and counterfactual.

Abstract: Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are widely adopted for their strong multimodal capabilities, yet they raise serious concerns such as privacy leakage and harmful content generation. Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for removing the influence of specific data from trained models. However, existing approaches largely rely on gradient-based optimization, incurring substantial computational costs for large-scale LVLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Knowledge Vector Weakening (KVW), a training-free unlearning method that directly intervenes in the full model without gradient computation. KVW identifies knowledge vectors that are activated during the model's output generation on the forget set and progressively weakens their contributions, thereby preventing the model from exploiting undesirable knowledge. Experiments on the MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that KVW achieves a stable forget-retain trade-off while significantly improving computational efficiency over gradient-based and LoRA-based unlearning methods.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter efficient specialization of large language models (LLMs) through modular adapters, resulting in rapidly growing public adapter pools spanning diverse tasks. Effectively using these adapters requires routing: selecting and composing the appropriate adapters for a query. We introduce LORAUTER, a novel routing framework that selects and composes LoRA adapters using task representations rather than adapter characteristics. Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) from human preference data is crucial for obtaining LLM leaderboards. However, many existing approaches either rely on restrictive parametric assumptions or lack valid uncertainty quantification when flexible machine learning methods are used. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric statistical framework, DMLEval, for comparing and ranking LLMs from preference data using debiased machine learning (DML). For this, we introduce generalized average ranking scores (GARS), which generalize commonly used ranking models, including the Bradley-Terry model or PageRank/ Rank centrality, with complex human responses such as ties. DMLEval comes with the following advantages: (i) It produces statistically efficient estimates of GARS ranking scores. (ii) It naturally allows the incorporation of black-box machine learning methods for estimation. (iii) It can be combined with pre-trained LLM evaluators (e.g., using LLM-as-a-judge). (iv) It suggests optimal policies for collecting preference data under budget constraints. We demonstrate these advantages both theoretically and empirically using both synthetic and real-world preference datasets. In summary, our framework provides practitioners with powerful, state-of-the-art methods for comparing or ranking LLMs.

Motivation: 在大型语言模型训练中，为确保可重复性必须采用确定性实现，但现有实现的后向传播会导致高达约 37.9% 的吞吐量下降，主要源于计算和梯度归约的低效序列化。

Conclusion: 通过 DAG 调度优化，前向包封闭确定性注意力后向传播的关键路径，从而显著提升了 reproducible LLM 训练的吞吐量。

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

Abstract: Machine learning models are widely regarded as a way forward to tackle multi-query challenges that arise once expensive black-box simulations such as computational fluid dynamics are investigated. However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions. Different specific forms of the above-mentioned approach are introduced and compared to each other as well as only scalar-valued based infill. Results are presented for the NASA common research model for an uncertainty propagation task showcasing high level of accuracy at significantly smaller cost compared to an approach without active learning.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable method to approximate the kernel of the Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA). For this, we use a surrogate deep neural network (DNN) that learns a compact feature representation whose inner product replicates the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This avoids the need to compute large Jacobians. Training relies solely on efficient Jacobian-vector products, allowing to compute predictive uncertainty on large-scale pre-trained DNNs. Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations. Notwithstanding, biasing the learned kernel significantly enhances out-of-distribution detection. This remarks the benefits of the proposed method for finding better kernels than the NTK in the context of LLA to compute prediction uncertainty given a pre-trained DNN.

Abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (RL) allows agents to leverage experience across a distribution of tasks on which the agent can train at will, enabling faster learning of optimal policies on new test tasks. Despite its success in improving sample complexity on test tasks, many real-world applications, such as robotics and healthcare, impose safety constraints during testing. Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies. To address this gap, we propose an algorithm that refines policies learned during training, with provable safety and sample complexity guarantees for learning a near optimal policy on the test tasks. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that this sample complexity is tight.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

*Sidney Bender,Marco Morik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiDAE 在无需梯度的前提下，以解耦字典和扩散自编码器生成多重多样化对照物，配合对照知识蒸馏，从而在基础模型上实现更快、更稳健的快捷学习缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在零样本学习中的零-shot 能力强，但仍易受伪相关和“聪明汉斯”策略影响。现有缓解手段往往依赖不可用的群组标签或耗费计算资源的基于梯度的对抗优化。

Method: 提出 Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE)，将冻结的基础模型与可解释的解耦字典学习相结合，实现无梯度、快速的对抗生成。先在解耦字典方向上编辑模型嵌入，再通过扩散自编码器解码以生成多样化、解耦的对照物。与基线相比，支持一次生成多重解耦对照，提高速度。

Conclusion: 通过冻结模型与解耦字典学习相结合，可在保持可解释性的同时，高效生成多样化对照物，显著提升基础模型的鲁棒性与下游性能。

Abstract: Foundation models, despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, remain vulnerable to spurious correlations and 'Clever Hans' strategies. Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals. When paired with Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation, DiDAE-CFKD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating shortcut learning, improving downstream performance on unbalanced datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoHETS通过在Transformer中集成深度卷积和傅里叶专家并利用外生跨注意，结合轻量卷积解码，显著提升多变量长时序预测精度，平均MSE下降12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界多变量时序数据呈现多尺度复杂结构（全局趋势、局部周期、非平稳变化），传统稀疏Mixture-of-Experts以MLP专家为主无法充分捕获多样的时间动态；迫切需要一种能专门化、扩展性好且鲁棒的框架来应对长时预测挑战。

Method: 采用Encoder-only Transformer架构，插入稀疏MoHE层；在MoHE中引入共享深度卷积专家处理序列整体连续性，采用傅里叶基专家捕捉周期性局部结构；通过交叉注意力融合外生变量；最后用轻量级卷积补丁解码器替代参数量大的线性投影头，实现参数效率与模型泛化。

Result: 在七项多变量基准测试与多预测时距下，MoHETS持续取得领先，平均MSE比近期强基线降低12%；证明其在多尺度、异构专家化方面有效提升长期预测性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了MoHETS，一种仅使用编码器的Transformer模型，结合稀疏的混合异构专家（MoHE）来提升多变量长时序预测的精度；实验验证显示其在七个基准数据集和多种预测时长上获得了显著的性能提升，平均MSE下降约12%。

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出了将目标矩阵分解为源子空间、低秩创新和稀疏编辑的迁移框架，并用锚定交替投影估计器实现，仅需估计新增低秩与稀疏项，即可在维度增长时获得更快更精准的估计，已在马尔可夫转移矩阵与协方差估计上得到理论与实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习系统常在随时间增长的高维空间中嵌入之前的低维表征，如何有效迁移已学习的知识并适应新的更大空间成为关键问题。

Method: 在目标参数中分解为嵌入的源子空间、低秩创新与稀疏编辑三部分；通过锚定的交替投影估计器（anchored alternating projection），既保持已学习的子空间，又仅估计新增的低秩和稀疏项。随后推导出分离目标噪声、表征增长与源估计误差的确定性误差界。

Result: 在两个典型问题中验证了框架的有效性：(1) 在单一轨迹的马尔可夫转移矩阵估计中获得端到端理论保证；(2) 对结构化协方差估计在维度扩大的情形下给出补充理论分析，并在实验中验证迁移带来的一致提升。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种通用的迁移学习框架，能够在环境维度和内在表征共同扩大的条件下，利用已有源任务的子空间信息，大幅提升目标任务的矩阵估计精度，尤其在低秩增量和稀疏增量较小的情况下获得更好的收敛速度。

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

Conclusion: 通过对成本向量的正则化，可有效缓解扰动强度波动带来的不稳定性，从而提升决策驱动学习的整体性能。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning integrates predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization by training models to directly improve decision quality rather than prediction accuracy alone. Differentiating through combinatorial optimization problems represents a central challenge, and recent approaches tackle this difficulty by introducing perturbation-based approximations. In this work, we focus on estimating the objective function coefficients of a combinatorial optimization problem. Our study demonstrates that fluctuations in perturbation intensity occurring during the learning phase can lead to ineffective training, by establishing a theoretical link to the notion of solution stability in combinatorial optimization. We propose addressing this issue by introducing a regularization of the estimated cost vectors which improves the robustness and reliability of the learning process, as demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to their capacity to generate chain-of-thought-style intermediate reasoning. Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.

Abstract: Global air quality forecasting grapples with extreme spatial heterogeneity and the poor generalization of existing transductive models to unseen regions. To tackle this, we propose OmniAir, a semantic topology learning framework tailored for global station-level prediction. By encoding invariant physical environmental attributes into generalizable station identities and dynamically constructing adaptive sparse topologies, our approach effectively captures long-range non-Euclidean correlations and physical diffusion patterns across unevenly distributed global networks. We further curate WorldAir, a massive dataset covering over 7,800 stations worldwide. Extensive experiments show that OmniAir achieves state-of-the-art performance against 18 baselines, maintaining high efficiency and scalability with speeds nearly 10 times faster than existing models, while effectively bridging the monitoring gap in data-sparse regions.

Conclusion: LoRIF 能够在大规模模型和数据集上实现梯度基训练数据归因的可行性，显著降低存储和查询成本且保持或提升归因质量。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) identifies which training examples most influenced a model's prediction. The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \emph{(ii)} forming the $D \times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality. LoRIF makes gradient-based TDA practical at frontier scale.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across fields has amplified concerns about model interpretability. Distressingly, these models are often treated as black-boxes, with limited or non-existent investigation of their decision making process. Despite numerous post- and ante-hoc interepretability methods, systematic and objective evaluation of the learned representations remains limited, particularly for sparsity-aware methods that are increasingly considered to "induce interpretability". In this work, we focus on Concept Bottleneck Models and investigate how different modeling decisions affect the emerging representations. We introduce the notion of clarity, a measure, capturing the interplay between the downstream performance and the sparsity and precision of the concept representation, while proposing an interpretability assessment framework using datasets with ground truth concept annotations. We consider both VLM- and attribute predictor-based CBMs, and three different sparsity-inducing strategies: per example $\ell_1, \ell_0$ and Bernoulli-based formulations. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between flexibility and interpretability, under which a given method can exhibit markedly different behaviors even at comparable performance levels. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

Conclusion: AUM框架通过显式建模不确定性和动态聚合，可更好处理缺失模态问题，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Medical multimodal learning faces significant challenges with missing modalities prevalent in clinical practice. Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: 本文表明使用蒙特卡罗dropout估计的FID及特征嵌入模型的预测方差，能够在不同程度上与输入样本的 OOD 相关，从而为评估F时的可信度提供指示器。

Abstract: Feature embeddings acquired from pretrained models are widely used in medical applications of deep learning to assess the characteristics of datasets; e.g. to determine the quality of synthetic, generated medical images. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is one popular synthetic image quality metric that relies on the assumption that the characteristic features of the data can be detected and encoded by an InceptionV3 model pretrained on ImageNet1K (natural images). While it is widely known that this makes it less effective for applications involving medical images, the extent to which the metric fails to capture meaningful differences in image characteristics is not obviously known. Here, we use Monte Carlo dropout to compute the predictive variance in the FID as well as a supplemental estimate of the predictive variance in the feature embedding model's latent representations. We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

Motivation: E(3)-等变扩散模型往往继承半经验训练数据的偏差；物理引导纠正分布但需频繁昂贵的量子化学计算，导致两大计算瓶颈。

Method: 1）用预训练的机器学习力场(MLFF)代替昂贵的 DFT 评估；2）将物理引导迁移至训练阶段，将反向扩散视为强化学习问题，提出 Force–Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED‑GRPO)，在训练中独立优化基于能量的奖励和基于力的稳定奖励，并进行组归一化。

Result: 实验表明 Elign 生成的构象在金标准 DFT 能量与力上更低，稳定性更好；且推理过程依旧快速，无需实时能量评估。

Conclusion: Elign 通过后训练框架在保持高效推理的同时显著降低生成分子构象的 DFT 能量和力，并提升机械稳定性。

Abstract: Generative models for 3D molecular conformations must respect Euclidean symmetries and concentrate probability mass on thermodynamically favorable, mechanically stable structures. However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently. Experiments show that Elign generates conformations with lower gold-standard DFT energies and forces, while improving stability. Crucially, inference remains as fast as unguided sampling, since no energy evaluations are required during generation.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning is often \emph{nonstationary}: rewards and dynamics drift, accelerate, oscillate, and trigger abrupt switches in the optimal action. Existing theory often represents nonstationarity with coarse-scale models that measure \emph{how much} the environment changes, not \emph{how} it changes locally -- even though acceleration and near-ties drive tracking error and policy chattering. We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length--curvature--kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly. Experiments show improved tracking and dynamic regret over matched static baselines, with the largest gains in oscillatory and switch-prone regimes.

Abstract: Imbalanced Domain Generalization (IDG) focuses on mitigating both domain and label shifts, both of which fundamentally shape the model's decision boundaries, particularly under heterogeneous long-tailed distributions across domains. Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes. Meanwhile, intra-class compactness is encouraged through a re-weighted cross-entropy strategy, and posterior consistency across domains is enforced through a prediction-central alignment strategy. Finally, rigorous yet challenging experiments on benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our NDCL. The code is available at https://github.com/Alrash/NDCL.

TL;DR: STARS：在推理时利用 Stiefel 流形对并行生成路径的激活进行正交调控，提升多样性，速度快、无需训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型往往只输出高概率的少数样本，生成路径同质化，导致模式坍塌；采样方法虽然引入随机性，但无法在多次并行生成中保证多样性。

Method: STARS（Stiefel-based Activation Steering for Diverse REASONing）是一种训练无关、推理时的干预策略。它在每个 token 上收集并行生成路径的隐藏激活，并在 Stiefel 流形上联合优化多个加性调控方向，最大化激活向量的几何体积并使调控方向正交，从而显式促进并行路径激活向量的多样性。

Result: 在测试案例生成和科学发现基准上，STARS 在保持质量的前提下显著提升了生成多样性，优于常规采样方法。

Conclusion: 通过流形优化的激活调控，STARS 能在推理时快速、低延迟地增强语言模型生成的多样性，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning is often measured at the performance or last-layer representation level, overlooking the underlying mechanisms. We introduce a mechanistic framework that offers a geometric interpretation of catastrophic forgetting as the result of transformations to the encoding of individual features. These transformations can lead to forgetting by reducing the allocated capacity of features (worse representation) and disrupting their readout by downstream computations. Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios. Through experiments on this model, we empirically test our formal analysis and highlight the detrimental effect of depth. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework can be used in the analysis of practical models through the use of Crosscoders. We present a case study of a Vision Transformer trained on sequential CIFAR-10. Our work provides a new, feature-centric vocabulary for continual learning.

Abstract: The quality of machine learning models depends heavily on their training data. Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance. Furthermore, in a comprehensive experimental study, we demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm compared to other classifier-based filtering methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the model from revealing private information when queried about target images. Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对齐式忘记方法只在预测空间抑制遗忘内容，导致遗忘概念仍残留在内部表示并与已保留知识相互纠缠。

Method: 在表示空间中为忘记特征与保留特征构造对比正则项，将忘记特征“推离”保留特征，并最小化对保留特征的干扰。

Result: 在多种LLM模型与忘记基准上，CLReg显著降低了忘记-保留表示耦合，提升了忘记效果，且不产生额外隐私风险。

Conclusion: CLReg通过对比正则化显著降低了遗忘特征与保留特征的耦合，实现了在保持已记知识性能下的有效撤记。

Abstract: Most LLM unlearning methods aim to approximate retrain-from-scratch behaviors with minimal distribution shift, often via alignment-style objectives defined in the prediction space. While effective at reducing forgotten content generation, such approaches may act as suppression: forgotten concepts can persist in representations and remain entangled with retained knowledge. We introduce CLReg, a contrastive representation regularizer that identifies forget features while pushing them away from retain features, explicitly reducing forget-retain interference with minimal shifts on retain features. We provide first theoretical insights that relate representation shaping to entanglement reduction. Across unlearning benchmarks and LLMs of different sizes, CLReg decreases forget-retain representation entanglement that facilitates mainstream unlearning methods without positing extra privacy risks, inspiring future work that reshapes the representation space to remove forget concepts.

TL;DR: 提出新问题 EIP，使用集成逆生成模型实现非迭代高效后验采样；训练不需循环前向模型，能隐式学习似然；实验验证其优越性与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的逆问题（如高能物理中的展开、全波形反演等）需要迭代使用前向模型，计算成本高且易受先验影响。提出集成反演问题（EIP）旨在通过利用观测集的集成信息，提升后验推断质量并实现对未知先验的泛化。

Method: 通过构造条件生成模型——集成逆生成模型，利用观测集内的集成信息而非单一测量，训练时跨多组真值-观测对（同一前向模型但来自不同先验）以隐式编码似然函数，从而实现推断时无需显式地、反复使用前向模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成与真实数据集上均能显著提升后验精度，尤其在面对未见先验时保持稳健；相较于现有迭代方法，推断速度快且无需显式前向模型运行。

Conclusion: 本文提出的非迭代推断式集成反演方法在逆问题中实现了高效且泛化良好的后验采样，验证了其在模拟与真实数据集上的优越性。

Abstract: We introduce a new multivariate statistical problem that we refer to as the Ensemble Inverse Problem (EIP). The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.

Motivation: 传统任务算术在去除隐私信息时对所有参数执行统一操作，导致重要参数被错误遗忘，出现过度遗忘现象。

Method: 在任务算术中为每个参数引入可调整权重，对任务向量进行缩放，权重通过梯度或Fisher信息估计得到，形成PerTA-grad和PerTA-fisher两种实现。

Result: 实验表明，PerTA在遗忘效果和模型整体实用性上均优于标准TV，并在多场景下超过主流训练‑基遗忘方法。

Conclusion: PerTA通过对参数层次化调整任务向量，在保持效率的同时显著减少过度遗忘并在多项实验中优于传统训练式遗忘方法。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) unlearning, private information is required to be removed. Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility. By retaining the efficiency of task arithmetic while mitigating over-forgetting, PerTA offers a principled and practical framework for LLM unlearning.

Motivation: To bridge holographic principles of quantum gravity with modern generative machine learning, exploiting AdS geometry for improved modeling and interpretability.

Method: It proposes representing data-flow via bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS, augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics, and evaluates on toy checkerboard and MNIST datasets.

Result: Experimental results show faster convergence and better quality compared to physics-free flow-matching models on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that incorporating AdS/CFT physics into flow-matching generative models yields faster, higher-quality convergence and provides a physically interpretable framework.

Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.

Motivation: 传统分布距离混淆了几何位移与规模、采样等保持性因素，导致无法真正度量组间融合程度，尤其在领域迁移时需要更加准确的测度。

Method: 先定义跨融合距离(CFD)，通过理论证明其不变性与敏感性，然后在合成与真实数据上做实验验证其与下游泛化退化的相关性。

Result: 在合成实验中CFD体现了理论预期的性质；在真实数据集上，CFD与模型泛化性能退化的相关性高于现有常用指标。

Conclusion: CFD能够准确量化表示空间中数据组的融合程度，并对融合改变因素敏感，对融合保持因素鲁棒。

Abstract: Quantifying degrees of fusion and separability between data groups in representation space is a fundamental problem in representation learning, particularly under domain shift. A meaningful metric should capture fusion-altering factors like geometric displacement between representation groups, whose variations change the extent of fusion, while remaining invariant to fusion-preserving factors such as global scaling and sampling-induced layout changes, whose variations do not. Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity. We characterize the invariance and sensitivity properties of CFD theoretically and validate them in controlled synthetic experiments. For practical utility on real-world datasets with domain shift, CFD aligns more closely with downstream generalization degradation than commonly used alternatives. Overall, CFD provides a theoretically grounded and interpretable distance measure for representation learning.

Motivation: 大型基础模型在预训练后往往产生过度自信的预测，传统深度集成虽然能实现良好的不确定性评估，但其线性增长的计算成本在资源受限环境中不可行。

Method: SVE 依赖于权重矩阵奇异向量构成的“知识方向”假设，冻结这些向量，同时在每个成员中训练对应的奇异值以重新标定这些方向的贡献。通过随机初始化和批训练的随机性自然产生多样化的模型成员，形成隐式的集成。

Result: SVE 在 NLP 与视觉任务中实现了与显式深度集成相当的不确定性量化效果，仅将模型参数增幅控制在 1% 以下，且在保持预测准确率的同时显著改善了校准性能。

Conclusion: Singular Value Ensemble（SVE）通过冻结奇异向量并仅训练奇异值，实现了几乎不增加模型参数的显著不确定性量化，提升了大型基础模型的校准性能，并让资源有限的场景下能够有效估计不确定性。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) "knowledge directions". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings. We validate SVE on NLP and vision tasks with various different backbones and show that it improves calibration while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

Conclusion: 潜在空间正则化（GANPO）是提升语言模型偏好优化的有效策略，兼顾稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Learning from human feedback typically relies on preference optimization that constrains policy updates through token-level regularization. However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization. Further, by comparing GANPO-induced inferential biases with those from token-level regularization, we find that GANPO provides more robust structural feedback under distributional shift and noise while maintaining comparable downstream performance with minor computational overhead.

Conclusion: GeoNorm是一种新型归一化方法，能够持续优于现有的Pre-Norm或Post-Norm实现，并且可无缝集成到标准Transformer架构中，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The placement of normalization layers, specifically Pre-Norm and Post-Norm, remains an open question in Transformer architecture design. In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.

Abstract: Optimizing Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) using policy gradient (a.k.a CVaR-PG) faces significant challenges of sample inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from the fact that it focuses on tail-end performance and overlooks many sampled trajectories. We address this problem by augmenting CVaR with an expected quantile term. Quantile optimization admits a dynamic programming formulation that leverages all sampled data, thus improves sample efficiency. This does not alter the CVaR objective since CVaR corresponds to the expectation of quantile over the tail. Empirical results in domains with verifiable risk-averse behavior show that our algorithm within the Markovian policy class substantially improves upon CVaR-PG and consistently outperforms other existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.

Motivation: 传统积分器受小时间步长限制，导致长时间演化计算成本高；现有机器学习方法需要昂贵轨迹生成，难以在大步长下稳定。

Method: 引入了 Mean Flow consistency 条件，对时间平均的 Hamiltonian 动力学进行约束，使得模型可以仅在离散的相空间样本上训练，而无需未来状态或完整轨迹。

Result: 在多种 Hamiltonian 系统（包括分子动力学）上验证，所提模型在相同训练和推理成本下可使用显著更大的时间步长，并保持与传统方法相当的精度。

Conclusion: 通过学习Hamiltonian Flow Maps，论文提出一种能够在大时间步长下稳定地模拟 Hamiltonian 系统的方法，实现了比传统数值积分器更高的效率。

Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共仓库中存在大量微调模型，但社区使用仅集中在少数基础检查点。作者想知道这是否是高效市场选择，还是更优模型被系统性忽视。

Method: 将模型发现过程建模为多臂赌博机问题，采用共享查询集与激进淘汰计划的序列剪枝算法，显著减少对每个候选模型的评估次数。

Result: 通过评估2000多种模型，证实存在“隐形宝石”，如在Llama-3.1-8B系列中，少数不受欢迎检查点在不增加推理成本的前提下，将数学性能从83.2%提升至96.0%；所提方法仅用约50次查询即可检索到顶尖模型，搜索速度提升50倍以上。

Conclusion: 本文指出，虽然社区对少数基础检查点的依赖度高，但在海量微调模型中存在大量被低估、性能优于主流模型的隐形宝石；通过提出一种基于多臂赌博机和序列剪枝的加速搜索策略，作者能够在极低查询次数下高效发现这些优质模型，从而弥补市场选择偏差。

Abstract: Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through an extensive evaluation of over 2,000 models, we show the prevalence of "hidden gems", unpopular fine-tunes that significantly outperform their popular counterparts. Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs. However, discovering these models through exhaustive evaluation of every uploaded model is computationally infeasible. We therefore formulate model discovery as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and accelerate the Sequential Halving search algorithm by using shared query sets and aggressive elimination schedules. Our method retrieves top models with as few as 50 queries per candidate, accelerating discovery by over 50x.
