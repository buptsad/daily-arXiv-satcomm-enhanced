In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528HPPC\u5b9e\u9a8c\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u7535\u538b\u7535\u6d41\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3DMD\u548cDMDc\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316RSS\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08DMDc1810\uff0c\u8f93\u51656\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8001\u5316\u7535\u6c60\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u8001\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u7535\u538b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6c\u77ac\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u6750\u6599\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u7535\u538b\u7535\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u6355\u83b7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u538b\u548c\u7535\u6d41HPPC\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0840\u20132000\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u7167\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9DMD\u548cDMDc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e73\u65b9\u548c\uff08RSS\uff09\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528DMDc\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7535\u6d41\u4e0a\u4e5f\u52a0\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\uff081\u201312\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c0fRSS\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18embedding\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3a1810\u7684DMDc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0aRSS\u4e3a3.86\uff1b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6807\u51c6DMD\u6a21\u578bRSS\u4e3a30\u3002\u518d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5728DMDc\u8f93\u5165\u77e9\u9635\u4e2dembedding=6\u65f6\uff0cRSS\u964d\u81f31.74\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e9\u9635A\u3001B\u5728\u8001\u5316\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u5373\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u8001\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u7535\u538b\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u77ac\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff08DMD\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5e26\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53d8\u4f53DMDc\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u538b\u7535\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u9502\u7535\u6c60\u5728\u4e0d\u540cSoC\u53ca\u8001\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u5373\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u8001\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness.

This letter revisits near-field beam training using conventional DFT codebooks. Unlike far-field responses that concentrate energy on a few isolated DFT beams, near-field responses produce contiguous, plateau-like energy segments with sharp transitions in the DFT beamspace. Pure LASSO denoising, therefore, tends to over-shrink magnitudes and fragment plateaus. We propose a beam-pattern-preserving beam training scheme for multiple-path scenarios that combines LASSO with a lightweight denoising pipeline: LASSO to suppress small-amplitude noise, followed by total variation (TV) to maintain plateau levels and edge sharpness. The two proximal steps require no near-field codebook design.

While countless meme coins are deployed across multiple blockchains, they rely heavily on off-chain web and social infrastructure to signal legitimacy. These very signals are largely absent from existing datasets, which are often limited to single-chain data or lack the multimodal artifacts required for comprehensive risk modeling.\n  To address this gap, we introduce MemeChain, a large-scale, open-source, cross-chain dataset comprising 34,988 meme coins across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. MemeChain integrates on-chain data with off-chain artifacts, including website HTML source code, token logos, and linked social media accounts, enabling multimodal and forensic study of meme coin projects.

This paper presents a hybrid model that incorporates multitask learning to assist efficient data encoding and employs a location weight module with quantum convolution operations to extract valid features for classification.

We introduce diversity evolution (DivE), a Boolean-function-based analysis method that tracks how the fading dependence of belief-propagation messages evolves across decoding iterations. Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The proposed model accurately describes the inherent time dependence of the rectifier, highlighting its fundamental impact on both energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. Based on the provided memory-aware model, we design a low-complexity adaptive detector that learns the nonlinear state transition dynamics and performs decision-directed detection with linear complexity. The proposed detection scheme approaches maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) performance in memory-dominated regimes, while avoiding the exponential search required by classical sequence detection.

These maliciously crafted inputs can exploit LLMs, causing data leaks, unauthorized actions, or compromised outputs, for instance. As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic.

They are particularly competent in correcting burst errors, being widely applied in modern communications and data storage systems. This also thanks to their distance property of reaching the Singleton bound, being the maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance.

The system operates under user mobility, dynamic blockages, colluding idle and active eavesdroppers, and transceiver and surface hardware impairments. A 3GPP and ITU-compliant stochastic channel model is developed, capturing mobility-induced covariance evolution, outdoor-indoor penetration losses, and distortion-aware noise due to practical EVM-based impairments. We aim to minimize the aggregate secrecy-outage probability subject to secrecy-rate constraints, QoS requirements, power limitations, and statistical CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem contains coupled secrecy and QoS chance constraints and nonlinear interactions among the BS beamforming vectors, multi-surface phase coefficients, and UAV position. To handle these difficulties, we derive rigorous Bernstein-type deterministic approximations for all chance constraints, yielding a distributionally robust reformulation. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to convexify each block and solve the BS beamforming, RIS, STAR-RIS, H-RIS configuration, and UAV placement subproblems efficiently. The proposed algorithm is shown to monotonically decrease a smooth surrogate of the secrecy-outage cost and converge to a stationary point of the robustified problem. Simulations based on 3GPP TR 38.901, TR 36.873, and ITU-R P.2109 demonstrate that integrating UAV-RIS, STAR-RIS, and H-RIS significantly reduces secrecy-outage probability compared with benchmark schemes and provides strong robustness to channel uncertainty, blockages, colluding eavesdroppers, and hardware impairments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528UAV+STAR+H-RIS\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Bernstein\u7ea6\u675f\u548cSCA\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u963b\u585e\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u5b89\u5168\u4e0b\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u670d\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1CSI\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5931\u771f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5e73\u53f0RIS\u534f\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e3GPP/ITU\u7684\u968f\u673a\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Bernstein\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u903c\u8fd1\u5c06\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u51f8\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528SCA\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u51f8\u5316\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6c42\u89e3\u57fa\u7ad9\u5929\u7ebf\u6ce2\u675f\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u9762\u76f8\u4f4d\u7cfb\u6570\u53ca\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u81f3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u6001\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u4ee53GPP TR 38.901\u3001TR 36.873\u53caITU-R P.2109\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff0cUAV-RIS+STAR-RIS+H-RIS\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u5931\u6548\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u963b\u585e\u3001\u534f\u540c\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5931\u771f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408UAV-mounted RIS\u3001\u7a7a\u4e2dSTAR-RIS\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u5168\u606fRIS\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u73af\u5883\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u5931\u6548\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u3001\u963b\u585e\u3001\u534f\u540c\u7a83\u542c\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Watermarking is a promising approach, but existing methods either provide only binary signals or distort the sampling distribution, degrading text quality; distortion-free approaches, in turn, often suffer from weak detectability or robustness. We propose MirrorMark, a multi-bit and distortion-free watermark for LLMs. By mirroring sampling randomness in a measure-preserving manner, MirrorMark embeds multi-bit messages without altering the token probability distribution, preserving text quality by design. To improve robustness, we introduce a context-based scheduler that balances token assignments across message positions while remaining resilient to insertions and deletions. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the equal error rate to interpret empirical performance. Experiments show that MirrorMark matches the text quality of non-watermarked generation while achieving substantially stronger detectability: with 54 bits embedded in 300 tokens, it improves bit accuracy by 8-12% and correctly identifies up to 11% more watermarked texts at 1% false positive rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "MirrorMark\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u955c\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u65e0\u5931\u771f\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u5185\u5bb9\u5f52\u5c5e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e2d\u955c\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u7ef4\u6301\u6d4b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u572854\u6bd4\u7279\u5d4c\u5165300\u4e2atoken\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMirrorMark\u63d0\u5347\u4e868\u201312%\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u57281%\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4e0b\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u989d\u5916\u7ea611%\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u975e\u6c34\u5370\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "MirrorMark\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u3001\u65e0\u5931\u771f\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error.

A rigorous system framework incorporating realistic 3GPP Tapped Delay Line (TDL) channel models is established to accurately capture high-mobility propagation characteristics. To counteract channel aging effects while maintaining low computational complexity, an SNR-aware flexible FTN strategy is introduced, wherein a low-complexity Look-Up Table (LUT) is utilized to adaptively optimize the time-domain compression factor based on instantaneous channel responses. Through this mechanism, the trade-off between rate acceleration and interference penalty is effectively resolved, ensuring that spectral efficiency is maximized while strict reliability constraints are satisfied with minimal processing overhead. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided, in which analytical expressions for effective throughput, energy efficiency, and bit error rate are derived. Finally, it is demonstrated by extensive simulations that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms static FTN benchmarks, offering a superior balance of high throughput and robustness for next-generation LEO communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.\n  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings.

The architecture incorporates a microcontroller connected to a single-antenna receiver operating at the same frequency as the RIS unit elements, operating either in transmission or reflection mode. The transmitting RIS elements enable the low latency estimation of both the incoming and outcoming channels at the microcontroller's side. In addition, a machine learning approach for estimating the incoming and outcoming channels involving the remaining RIS elements operating in reflection mode is devised. Specifically, by appropriately selecting a small number of elements in transmission mode, and based on the channel reciprocity principle, the respective channel coefficients are first estimated, which are then fed to a low-complexity neural network that, leveraging spatial channel correlation over RIS elements, returns predictions of the channel coefficients referring to the rest of elements. In this way, the SORIS microcontroller acquires channel state information, and accordingly reconfigures the panel's metamaterials to assist data communication between a transmitter and a receiver, without the need for separate connections with them. Moreover, the impact of channel estimation on the proposed solution, and a detailed complexity analysis for the used model, as well as a wiring density and control signaling analysis, is performed.

To address these challenges, we introduce FraudShield, a novel framework designed to protect LLMs from fraudulent content by leveraging a comprehensive analysis of fraud tactics. Specifically, FraudShield constructs and refines a fraud tactic-keyword knowledge graph to capture high-confidence associations between suspicious text and fraud techniques. The structured knowledge graph augments the original input by highlighting keywords and providing supporting evidence, guiding the LLM toward more secure responses.

This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses these limitations. We demonstrate that by spatially resolving the fluorescence profile along the vapor cell, the multi-target problem can be effectively solved. Our approach hinges on the insight that by superimposing incoming signals with a strong local oscillator (LO), the complex atomic absorption pattern is linearized into a simple superposition of sinusoids. In this new representation, each spatial frequency uniquely and directly maps to the DoA of a target. This reduces the multi-target challenge into a spectral estimation problem, which we address using Prony's method.

Specifically, we design a Temporal Adapter to deeply entangle watermarks with acoustic attributes, synergizing with a Coarse-to-Fine Gated Extractor to resist advanced attacks. Furthermore, we develop an Accuracy-Guided Optimization Curriculum that dynamically orchestrates gradient flow to resolve the optimization conflict between fidelity and robustness.

We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework.

Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

Both sensing and communication succeed with given probabilities and incur distinct costs. The objective is to optimise a long-term cost that captures information freshness, measured by the age of information (AoI), at the source together with sensing and communication overheads. The resulting sequential decision problem is formulated as a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process with a two-dimensional AoI state, representing information freshness at the source and at the base station. We prove that the optimal stationary policy admits a monotone threshold structure characterised by a nondecreasing switching curve in the AoI state space. Our numerical analysis illustrates the structures of the value function and the optimal decision map.

Akan"], "title": "Intrinsic MIMO Particle Communication Channel with Random Advection", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "In this work, receiver diversity in advection-dominated diffusion-advection channels is investigated. Strong directed flow fundamentally alters the communication-theoretic properties of molecular communication systems (MC). Specifically, advection preserves the temporal ordering and shape of transmitted pulses, enabling pulse-based and higher-order modulation schemes that are typically infeasible in purely diffusive environments. Focusing on a single transmitter and a single type of information molecule, it is demonstrated that spatially distributed receivers can observe distinct realizations of the same transmitted signal, giving rise to diversity gain. Several receiver combining strategies are evaluated and shown to improve detection performance compared to single-receiver operation, particularly in low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The results provide a structured framework for understanding receiver-side diversity in molecular communication, highlighting the role of advection as a key enabler for reliable pulse-based signaling.

However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the \"semantic trap,\" where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e38\u9677\u5165\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\u201d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177TrapEval\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6839\u56e0\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrapEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u9020V2N\uff08\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\uff09\u548cV2P\uff08\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u8865\u4e01\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\uff09\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u6270\u52a8\u4e0eCodeBLEU\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u4e94\u5927\u7c7bLLM\u5728TrapEval\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8865\u4e01\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49\u6539\u53d8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5927\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77ed\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u5b89\u5168\u6839\u56e0\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\u201d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\u4e0e\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u6b64\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads.

Under a natural set of operational axioms, the most general form of entropy is captured by the family of R\u00e9nyi entropies, parameterized by a real number $\u03b1$. Conditional entropy extends the notion of entropy by quantifying uncertainty from the viewpoint of an observer with access to potentially correlated side information. However, despite their significance and the emergence of various useful definitions, a complete characterization of measures of conditional entropy that satisfy a natural set of operational axioms has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of conditional entropy, defined through a set of axioms that are essential for any operationally meaningful definition: additivity for independent random variables, invariance under relabeling, and monotonicity under conditional mixing channels. We prove that the most general form of conditional entropy is captured by a family of measures that are exponential averages of R\u00e9nyi entropies of the conditioned distribution and parameterized by a real parameter and a probability measure on the positive reals. Finally, we show that these quantities determine the rate of transformation under conditional mixing and provide a set of second laws of quantum thermodynamics with side information for states diagonal in the energy eigenbasis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u4e09\u6761\u76f4\u89c9\u516c\u7406\u5b8c\u5168\u5212\u5206\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u662f\u745e\u5948\u71b5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u4fa7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u201c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u201d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u7136\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u516c\u7406\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u91cf\u5ea6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u7ec4\u65e8\u5728\u6355\u6349\u201c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u610f\u4e49\u201d\u7684\u516c\u7406\uff08\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u7406\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc1\u660e\u4e3a\u745e\u5948\u71b5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u901a\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e09\u6761\u516c\u7406\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u6700\u4e00\u822c\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1a\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u745e\u5948\u71b5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u5b9e\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u5b9e\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u6b64\u7c7b\u91cf\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e26\u4fa7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6761\u81ea\u7136\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u516c\u7406\u2014\u2014\u72ec\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u901a\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e09\u6761\u516c\u7406\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u5747\u4e3a\u745e\u5948\u71b5\u7684\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u5b9e\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e26\u4fa7\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously.

We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift.

While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics.

However, traditional coverage-guided fuzzing may be less effective in specific tasks like verifying static analysis reports or reproducing crashes, while directed fuzzing, focusing on targeted program locations using proximity metrics, proves to be more effective. Some of the earliest directed fuzzers are, for example, AFLGo and BEACON, which use different proximity metric approaches. Although most automated testing tools focus on C/C++ code, the growing popularity of Rust and Go causes the need for precise and efficient testing solutions for these languages. This work expands the applicability of directed fuzzing beyond traditional analysis of C/C++ software. We present a novel approach to directed greybox fuzzing tailored specifically for Rust and Go applications. We introduce advanced preprocessing techniques, rustc compiler customizations, and elaborate graph construction and instrumentation methods to enable effective targeting of specific program locations. Our implemented fuzzing tools, based on LibAFL-DiFuzz backend, demonstrate competitive advantages compared to popular existing fuzzers like afl.rs, cargo-fuzz, and go-fuzz. According to TTE (Time to Exposure) experiments, Rust-LibAFL-DiFuzz outperforms other tools by the best TTE result. Some stability issues can be explained by different mutation approaches.

Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator\" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks.

Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity. Our approach offers practitioners a powerful tool for uncertainty estimation associated with conditional generative models, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous and interpretable prediction sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCP4Gen\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9884\u4f30\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6c14\u5019\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCP4Gen\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "CP4Gen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks.

We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior.

Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design.

This paper investigates the use of Differential Privacy (DP) as a robust defense mechanism for training an LLM for Kotlin code completion. We fine-tune a \\texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage.

We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization.

The system integrates large language models into the reconnaissance and decision-support phases of wireless security assessment, enabling intelligent target ranking, attack feasibility estimation, and strategy recommendation, while preserving strict human-in-the-loop control and budget-aware execution. We describe the system architecture, threat model, governance mechanisms, and prompt-engineering methodology, and empirical experiments conducted across multiple wireless environments. The results demonstrate that GenAI assistance improves target selection accuracy and overall assessment efficiency, while maintaining auditability and ethical safeguards.

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization.

Furthermore, the evaluation demonstrates that the framework scales nearly linearly (R-squared = 0.998), achieves near-perfect acceptance of valid executions while consistently rejecting invalid ones, and maintains balanced model utilization across execution pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u7b7e\u5de5\u5177\u6e05\u5355+\u900f\u660e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684LLM\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3001\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u6821\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u6cd5\u548c\u900f\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6613\u53d7\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bf9\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5728Model Context Protocol\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u52a0\u5bc6\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6e05\u5355\u3001\u900f\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6267\u884c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u89c1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9694\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\uff08R\u00b2=0.998\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u5408\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e100%\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6267\u884c\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u6e05\u5355\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u7b7e\u540d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5185\u4fdd\u8bc1LLM\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy.

In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost.

We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints.

We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains.

Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields.

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$.

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it.

Finally, we study two lightweight interventions: splitting a fixed budget into parallel executions, which surprisingly improves performance despite a no-gain theoretical result for our tasks, and periodically summarizing the interaction history, which preserves key discoveries and further improves exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u63a2\u7d22\u8868\u73b0\u7cdf\u7cd5\uff1b\u62c6\u5206\u5e76\u884c\u4e0e\u603b\u7ed3\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u793a\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u6b20\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u7d22\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u8fde\u7eed\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u73af\u5883\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4ecb\u5165\uff1a\u5c06\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5468\u671f\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u6b20\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u2013\u5229\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u9884\u7b97\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f31\u3002\u62c6\u5206\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u610f\u5916\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5386\u53f2\u603b\u7ed3\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u884c\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u6458\u8981\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions.

We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation.

In practice, safety requirements are heterogeneous and admit only partial priority relations, where some constraints are comparable while others are inherently incomparable.

Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction.

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models.

In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash).

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced.

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u7ed3\u5408MoE\u4e0e\u56de\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6301\u7eedRL\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u7387>85%\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u7387<10%.", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027-\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u5176\u6301\u7eed\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4e2d\u592e\u901a\u624d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Meta-World\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc785%\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u572810%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift.

To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time.

Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness.

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations.

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning.

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods.

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework.

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models.

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDis\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\uff08\u672c\u5730/\u5168\u5c40\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u652f\u8def\u67b6\u6784\uff1aPersonalized Bank\u63d0\u53d6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u6709\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cGlobal Pattern Bank\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedDis\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDis\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lethe\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6301\u4e45\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u534f\u4f5c\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ee7\u7eed\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u53d1\uff08Knowledge resurfacing\uff09\u3002", "method": "Lethe\u91c7\u7528\u2018Reshape\u2013Rectify\u2013Restore\u2019\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4ee5\u653e\u5927\u9000\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u8be5\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u77ed\u671f\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1 Lethe \u5728\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u53d1\u7387\u843d\u57281%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Lethe\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8131\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u6837\u672c\uff09\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u53d1\u7387\uff08\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b<1%\uff09\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal logic verification-guided framework that dynamically interleaves formal symbolic verification with the natural language generation process, providing real-time feedback to detect and rectify errors as they occur. Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively.

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "GUDA\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6309\u7ec4\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5229\u7528ELBO\u5dee\u503c\u505a\u4f3c\u7136\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8eLOGO retraining\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7b49\u7ec4\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5LOGO retraining \u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u5728\u7ec4\u6570\u8f83\u591a\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\uff08machine unlearning\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6309\u7ec4\u201c\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u201d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5404\u7ec4\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684ELBO\u5dee\u503c\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u7ec4\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10 \u53ca Stable Diffusion \u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f52\u56e0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGUDA\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u53ca\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5728CIFAR-10 \u4e0a\u7f29\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e24\u767e\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GUDA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLOGO retraining \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization.

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics.

Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters.

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRDS\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u62c6\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5757\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff1b\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u5f20\u91cf\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\uff08S=BA\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaLoRDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8054\u5408QAT\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u79e9PEFT\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama3-8B\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cLoRDS\u57283\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u76f8\u8f83NormalFloat\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8fbe27.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728RTX 4090\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b01.5\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ee54bit QLoRA\u63d0\u53479.6%\u7684PEFT\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684LLM\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u7684PTQ/QAT\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u79e9\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance.

We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms.

In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFPO \u7528\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u4e8c\u6b21\u60e9\u7f5a\u66ff\u4ee3\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u5fae\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u88c1\u526a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u5931\u6548\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u603b\u53d8\u5dee(Total Variation)\u7684\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u60e9\u7f5a\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u88c1\u526a\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cCFPO \u4e0e\u88c1\u526a\u6cd5\u540c\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u671f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u8d85\u53c2", "conclusion": "CFPO \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f"}}

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4.

We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features.

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations.

In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models.

Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts.

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss.

In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$.

In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types.

Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent (\"true\") and observed (\"measured\") variables.

With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory.

To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions.

Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001).

This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data.

We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated.

The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response.

MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.\n  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDIS\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0ePDE\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DAPS\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u9006PDE\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7d22\u5f15\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u4f53\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u9006\u89e3\u5668(DDIS)\uff1a\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u8026\u9000\u706b\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837(DAPS)\u907f\u514d\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6DDIS\u907f\u514d\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0bl2\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u534711%\u3001\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u534754%\uff1b\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u4ec51%\u65f6\uff0cl2\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b40%\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "DDIS\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9006PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}
