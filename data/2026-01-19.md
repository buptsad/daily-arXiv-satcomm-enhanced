### [1] [Chatting with Confidants or Corporations? Privacy Management with AI Companions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10754)
*Hsuen-Chi Chiu,Jeremy Foote*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 情感伙伴AI模糊亲密与机构隐私界限，用户在自我披露与数据控制之间采取多层管理，却仍感平台不透明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人工智能聊天机器人作为情感伴侣在隐私管理中的作用与挑战，关注其模糊亲密关系与机构软件之间界限所产生的多维隐私环境。

Method: 通过深度访谈法，访谈15名使用Replika、Character.AI等伴侣AI平台的用户，结合沟通隐私管理理论与Masur的水平（用户-AI）与垂直（用户-平台）隐私框架，对数据进行归纳分析。

Result: 发现用户在情感安全与机构风险之间展开多层次隐私管理；虽然AI的无评判、随时可用特性促进情绪表达与自我披露，但对平台层面数据掌控仍感不确定、无力，且拟人化设计导致潜在过度披露与隐私波动。

Conclusion: 进一步丰富隐私理论，揭示情感与机构两大维度在人人工智能伴侣背景下的交互作用，并提出在设计与监管层面平衡情感安全与隐私防护的启示。

Abstract: AI chatbots designed as emotional companions blur the boundaries between interpersonal intimacy and institutional software, creating a complex, multi-dimensional privacy environment. Drawing on Communication Privacy Management theory and Masur's horizontal (user-AI) and vertical (user-platform) privacy framework, we conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen users of companion AI platforms such as Replika and Character.AI. Our findings reveal that users blend interpersonal habits with institutional awareness: while the non-judgmental, always-available nature of chatbots fosters emotional safety and encourages self-disclosure, users remain mindful of institutional risks and actively manage privacy through layered strategies and selective sharing. Despite this, many feel uncertain or powerless regarding platform-level data control. Anthropomorphic design further blurs privacy boundaries, sometimes leading to unintentional oversharing and privacy turbulence. These results extend privacy theory by highlighting the unique interplay of emotional and institutional privacy management in human-AI companionship.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal technology in the operation of large and complex systems, driving advancements in fields such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial fraud detection. Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we highlight the trade-offs between security measures and system performance, providing critical insights into optimizing security without unduly impacting operational efficiency. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach, offering valuable guidance for practitioners on how to achieve an optimal balance between security and performance in ML deployments across various domains.

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools using taint analysis are widely viewed as providing higher-quality vulnerability detection results compared to traditional pattern-based approaches. However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.

Abstract: We study the problem of adaptive privacy budgeting under generalized differential privacy. Consider the setting where each user $i\in [n]$ holds a tuple $x_i\in U:=U_1\times \dotsb \times U_T$, where $x_i(l)\in U_l$ represents the $l$-th component of their data. For every $l\in [T]$ (or a subset), an untrusted analyst wishes to compute some $f_l(x_1(l),\dots,x_n(l))$, while respecting the privacy of each user. For many functions $f_l$, data from the users are not all equally important, and there is potential to use the privacy budgets of the users strategically, leading to privacy savings that can be used to improve the utility of later queries. In particular, the budgeting should be adaptive to the outputs of previous queries, so that greater savings can be achieved on more typical instances. In this paper, we provide such an adaptive budgeting framework, with various applications demonstrating its applicability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The increased connectivity of industrial networks has led to a surge in cyberattacks, emphasizing the need for cybersecurity measures tailored to the specific requirements of industrial systems. Modern Industry 4.0 technologies, such as OPC UA, offer enhanced resilience against these threats. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to long installation times, proprietary technology, restricted flexibility, and formal process requirements (e.g. safety certifications). Consequently, many systems do not yet implement these technologies, or only partially. This leads to the challenge of dealing with so-called brownfield systems, which are often placed in isolated security zones to mitigate risks. However, the need for data exchange between secure and insecure zones persists.
  This paper reviews existing solutions to address this challenge by analysing their approaches, advantages, and limitations. Building on these insights, we identify three key concepts, evaluate their suitability and compatibility, and ultimately introduce the SigmaServer, a novel TCP-level aggregation method. The developed proof-of-principle implementation is evaluated in an operational technology (OT) testbed, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in bridging secure and insecure zones.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The agent-tool communication loop is a critical attack surface in modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.

### [7] [Towards Quantum-Resistant Trusted Computing: Architectures for Post-Quantum Integrity Verification Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11095)
*Grazia D'Onghia,Antonio Lioy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文分析根可信源对量子威胁的脆弱性，探讨后量子密码学在可信计算中的集成难点，并设计了一种可立即采用的后量子强化可信架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 根可信源（RoT）在可信系统中是一项核心安全手段，但传统的基于非对称加密的数字签名易受量子计算攻击，固件因生命周期长而更易受到威胁，迫切需要迁移至抗量子攻击的加密方案。

Method: 通过梳理现有可信技术与后量子密码学的现状，研究分析了PQC在可信计算环境中的集成挑战，并构建一种结合PQC的可信架构原型。

Result: 提出并验证了一套兼容现有可信计算技术的后量子增强架构，展示了其在大部分可信链条中实现量子抗御的可行性，并厘清了与现有算法的迁移路径。

Conclusion: 研究强调了可信计算中根可信源对量子计算的脆弱性，并提出了采用后量子密码学（PQC）增强可信体系结构的必要性与可行方案，最终确立了一个可立即采用的量子抗御架构。

Abstract: Trust is the core building block of secure systems, and it is enforced through methods to ensure that a specific system is properly configured and works as expected. In this context, a Root of Trust (RoT) establishes a trusted environment, where both data and code are authenticated via a digital signature based on asymmetric cryptography, which is vulnerable to the threat posed by Quantum Computers (QCs). Firmware, being the first layer of trusted software, faces unique risks due to its longevity and difficult update. The transition of firmware protection to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is urgent, since it reduces the risk derived from exposing all computing and network devices to quantum-based attacks. This paper offers an analysis of the most common trust techniques and their roadmap towards a Post-Quantum (PQ) world, by investigating the current status of PQC and the challenges posed by such algorithms in existing Trusted Computing (TC) solutions from an integration perspective. Furthermore, this paper proposes an architecture for TC techniques enhanced with PEC, addressing the imperative for immediate adoption of quantum-resistant algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算时代临近，传统公钥密码体系面临被量子算法破解的风险，亟须研究如何构建抗量子攻击的公钥基础设施（PKI）。

Method: 本文回顾最新的后量子算法（PQA）选型，并在X.509证书格式基础上，提出多项安全迁移需求。除此之外，还探讨了如何让证书吊销列表（CRL）和在线证书状态协议（OCSP）支持后量子算法。

Result: 通过对比分析，阐明了从传统PKI向后量子PKI迁移的关键技术难点与实现路径，给出了实际可行的迁移方案与适配建议。

Conclusion: 提供了全面而系统的后量子PKI转型框架，为密码学研究与安全部署者提供了技术蓝图。

Abstract: As the quantum computing era approaches, securing classical cryptographic protocols becomes imperative. Public key cryptography is widely used for signature and key exchange but it is the type of cryptography more threatened by quantum computing. Its application typically requires support via a public-key certificate, which is a signed data structure and must therefore face twice the quantum challenge: for the certified keys and for the signature itself. We present the latest developments in selecting robust Post-Quantum algorithms and investigate their applicability in the Public Key Infrastructure context. Our contribution entails defining requirements for a secure transition to a quantum-resistant Public Key Infrastructure, with a focus on adaptations for the X.509 certificate format. Additionally, we explore transitioning Certificate Revocation List and Online Certificate Status Protocol to support quantum-resistant algorithms. Through comparative analysis, we elucidate the complex transition to a quantum-resistant PKI.

Motivation: 现代集成电路生态系统日益依赖第三方IP集成，同时带来安全风险。需要在不泄露专有设计的前提下，解决IP供应商与系统集成商之间的信任死锁。

Method: 提出ZK-CEC框架，将形式化验证与零知识证明结合，设计证明暗示设计不满足公共约束的蓝图，并基于此实现了完整的隐私保护硬件形式化验证。

Result: 实现了ZK-CEC，并在多种电路（算术单元、加密组件）中实验验证。实验结果表明，例如AES S-Box可以在可接受时间内完成验证。

Conclusion: ZK-CEC成为首个实现隐私保护硬件形式化验证的框架，提供了形式化验证与零知识证明的安全集成方案。

Abstract: The modern integrated circuit ecosystem is increasingly reliant on third-party intellectual property integration, which introduces security risks, including hardware Trojans and security vulnerabilities. Addressing the resulting trust deadlock between IP vendors and system integrators without exposing proprietary designs requires novel privacy-preserving verification techniques. However, existing privacy-preserving hardware verification methods are all simulation-based and fail to offer formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose ZK-CEC, the first privacy-preserving framework for hardware formal verification. By combining formal verification and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), ZK-CEC establishes a foundation for formally verifying IP correctness and security without compromising the confidentiality of the designs.
  We observe that existing zero-knowledge protocols for formal verification are designed to prove statements of public formulas. However, in a privacy-preserving verification context where the formula is secret, these protocols cannot prevent a malicious prover from forging the formula, thereby compromising the soundness of the verification. To address these gaps, we first propose a blueprint for proving the unsatisfiability of a secret design against a public constraint, which is widely applicable to proving properties in software, hardware, and cyber-physical systems. Based on the proposed blueprint, we construct ZK-CEC, which enables a prover to convince the verifier that a secret IP's functionality aligns perfectly with the public specification in zero knowledge, revealing only the length and width of the proof. We implement ZK-CEC and evaluate its performance across various circuits, including arithmetic units and cryptographic components. Experimental results show that ZK-CEC successfully verifies practical designs, such as the AES S-Box, within practical time limits.

*Aiman Al Masoud,Marco Arazzi,Antonino Nocera*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SD‑RAG 在检索阶段对数据进行去污和披露控制，满足动态安全隐私约束，实验验证其在隐私保护和抗注入攻击方面优于现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 RAG 方法大多忽视将敏感或受限信息直接暴露给生成模型所带来的风险，并且对提示注入攻击缺乏有效防护。

Method: 在检索阶段引入语义机制与优化图结构，以基于安全隐私策略实现细粒度检索，随后仅将已过滤干净的结果输入 LLM，从而切断生成模型对原始敏感数据的直接访问。

Result: 与基线方法相比，SD‑RAG 在隐私得分上提升最高 58%，并在针对生成模型的提示注入攻击中保持高度稳健性。

Conclusion: 通过在检索阶段进行去污和披露控制，SD‑RAG 能更好地保护敏感信息并提升对提示注入的抵抗力，实验显示其隐私得分提升可达 58%。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.

Abstract: Backdoored and privacy-leaking deep neural networks pose a serious threat to the deployment of machine learning systems in security-critical settings. Existing defenses for backdoor detection and membership inference typically require access to clean reference models, extensive retraining, or strong assumptions about the attack mechanism. In this work, we introduce a novel LoRA-based oracle framework that leverages low-rank adaptation modules as a lightweight, model-agnostic probe for both backdoor detection and membership inference.
  Our approach attaches task-specific LoRA adapters to a frozen backbone and analyzes their optimization dynamics and representation shifts when exposed to suspicious samples. We show that poisoned and member samples induce distinctive low-rank updates that differ significantly from those generated by clean or non-member data. These signals can be measured using simple ranking and energy-based statistics, enabling reliable inference without access to the original training data or modification of the deployed model.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估文本到视频模型的 Membership Inference Risiken，提出 VidLeaks 框架，利用空间重构保真度与时间生成稳定性两种信号，证明这些模型在几乎无查询条件下仍可泄露大量成员信息，为后续防御研究提供了基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模T2V模型的兴起，版权与隐私风险突出；现有针对图片或文本的MIA方法无法处理视频的时空稀疏性与随机性，亟需针对T2V的专门评估机制。

Method: 通过构建两种互补信号——空间重构保真度（SRF）和时间生成稳定性（TGS）——跨尺度地捕获稀疏记忆的关键帧以及多次查询的语义一致性，VidLeaks在不同黑盒设置下进行Membership Inference Attack（MIA）评估，并用AUC作为性能指标。

Result: 在AnimateDiff与InstructVideo模型上，VidLeaks在严苛的查询仅限场景下分别取得82.92%和97.01%的AUC，显示出模型在空间与时间记忆方面的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 本文证明了文本到视频模型（T2V）在空间与时间维度上泄露了显著的成员信息，提出的新框架VidLeaks能够在三种黑盒攻击场景下（监督、参考、纯查询）以接近78-97%的AUC有效识别受害视频，从而为评估和防范此类隐私泄露奠定基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: InterPUF定义了一个基于可重构互连PUF且借助多方计算的分布式根信任架构，在不显著增加功耗或面积的前提下，在SiP平台上实现了强健的、无需中心锚点的芯片认证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代SiP平台对可重构互联器的高度依赖，传统的集中式认证方案难以在离散、后制造可编程环境中可扩展和适应，亟需一种低开销、分布式的认证机制。

Method: 在互联器中实现路由差分延迟物理不可克隆函数（PUF），并通过多方计算（MPC）在不暴露原始PUF签名的情况下完成认证；采用协作验证与加密哈希以增强安全性。

Result: 硬件评估表明InterPUF在不同芯片组上仅增加0.23%面积和0.072%功耗，认证时延维持在几十纳秒左右。仿真（pyPUF）证实其具备优秀的唯一性、可靠性以及对工艺、电压和温度变化的建模抵抗能力。

Conclusion: InterPUF通过在可重构互联间嵌入路由差分延迟PUF，并结合多方计算与加密哈希，构建了一个分布式根信任，实现了无需中心锚点的最小信任认证模型。

Abstract: Modern system-in-package (SiP) platforms increasingly adopt reconfigurable interposers to enable plug-and-play chiplet integration across heterogeneous multi-vendor ecosystems. However, this flexibility introduces severe trust challenges, as traditional authentication schemes fail to scale or adapt in decentralized, post-fabrication programmable environments. This paper presents InterPUF, a compact and scalable authentication framework that transforms the interposer into a distributed root of trust. InterPUF embeds a route-based differential delay physically unclonable function (PUF) across the reconfigurable interconnect and secures authentication using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring raw PUF signatures are never exposed. Our hardware evaluation shows only 0.23% area and 0.072% power overhead across diverse chiplets while preserving authentication latency within tens of nanoseconds. Simulation results using pyPUF confirm strong uniqueness, reliability, and modeling resistance under process, voltage, and temperature variations. By combining interposer-resident PUF primitives with cryptographic hashing and collaborative verification, InterPUF enforces a minimal-trust authentication model without relying on a centralized anchor.

Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) depends heavily on the reliability of charging infrastructure, yet approximately 1 in 5 drivers report being unable to charge during station visits due to inoperable equipment. While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent "zombie chargers" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.

Result: 得出状态空间分为线性部分$\mathcal{X}_L(α)$和非线性部分$\mathcal{X}_{NL}(α)$两区，分别对应传统线性H∞反馈和新的非线性反馈；同时证明相关Ricatti递推的单调性与有界性，并对解区几何形态进行刻画。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种针对离散时间信号约束干扰衰减调节器（SiDAR）的通用有限时域递归最优状态反馈控制方案，适用于任意初始状态，并证明了其可解性与最优性。

Abstract: This paper develops a generalized finite horizon recursive solution to the discrete time signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR) for state feedback control. This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to signal bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences whose squared signal two-norm is bounded by a fixed budget. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, we derive a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy valid for arbitrary initial states. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex scalar optimization for the Lagrange multiplier at each stage; the control is then explicit. For fixed disturbance budget $α$, the state space partitions into two distinct regions: $\mathcal{X}_L(α)$, where the optimal control policy is linear and coincides with the standard linear $H_{\infty}$ state feedback control, and $\mathcal{X}_{NL}(α)$, where the optimal control policy is nonlinear. We establish monotonicity and boundedness of the associated Riccati recursions and characterize the geometry of the solution regions. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical properties.
  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the finite horizon SiDAR for arbitrary initial states. Companion papers address the steady-state problem and convergence properties for the signal bound case, and the stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR).

Method: 在伴随论文中提出的有限时间递归解的基础上，构造极限状态SiDAR，并推导出复杂度为O(n^3)的可处理线性矩阵不等式（LMI）

Result: 对非退化系统，有限时间解在时间无穷大时收敛到极限状态解；对退化系统，收敛仅在状态空间的一部分成立，并在补充区域出现“转弯峰”现象；当收敛成立时，最优乘子和控制增益可直接由LMI得出

Conclusion: 本文证明了SiDAR的收敛与稳定特性，提供了适用于非退化和退化系统的解析和数值工具，并揭示了退化系统中的转弯峰现象

Abstract: This paper establishes convergence and steady-state properties for the signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR). Building on the finite horizon recursive solution developed in a companion paper, we introduce the steady-state SiDAR and derive its tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Systems are classified as degenerate or nondegenerate based on steady-state solution properties. For nondegenerate systems, the finite horizon solution converges to the steady-state solution for all states as the horizon approaches infinity. For degenerate systems, convergence holds in one region of the state space, while a turnpike arises in the complementary region. When convergence holds, the optimal multiplier and control gain are obtained directly from the LMI solution. Numerical examples illustrate convergence behavior and turnpike phenomena.
  Companion papers address the finite horizon SiDAR solution and the stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR).

Abstract: This paper develops a generalized finite horizon recursive solution to the discrete time stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR) for state feedback control. This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to stage bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences constrained independently at each time step through stagewise squared two-norm bounds. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, this work derives a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex optimization for the Lagrange multiplier vector at each stage; the control is then explicit. For systems with constant stage bound, the problem admits a steady-state optimization expressed as a tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of the solution.
  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the StDAR for arbitrary initial states. Companion papers address the signal bound disturbance attenuation regulator (SiDAR): the finite horizon solution in Part~I-A and convergence properties in Part~I-B.

TL;DR: 开发通用光刻工艺，使拉伸OFET实现高密度、低压、快速运作，并首次实现拉伸式神经元电路，推动皮肤电子的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软伸展有机场效应晶体管（OFET）在皮肤电子领域具有重要应用，但现有工艺往往与不同聚合物半导体（PSC）耦合，需要为每种材料单独优化，导致工艺繁琐且易致设备退化，尤其是互补电路需要连续两次聚合物沉积。

Method: 提出一种通用的单片光刻工艺，包含三项关键设计：1）直接光可刻、溶剂耐受的交联介电/半导体界面；2）保留高迁移率的广泛可用交联PSC混合物；3）实现同时刻蚀掩模和封装的掩模策略。该工艺实现高保水、单片式结构的拉伸互补OFET。

Result: 获得了可拉伸OTFT的记录集成密度55,000 cm⁻²、通道长度2 μm、低压5 V操作；完成3 kHz拉伸环振荡器（首次超1 kHz），相对现状提升60倍；以及首个拉伸互补OTFT神经元电路，可根据输入电流调制输出频率。

Conclusion: 该可扩展、低成本的光刻平台兼容多种高性能拉伸材料，显著加速了皮肤式电子器件的研发与制造。

Abstract: Soft, stretchable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) can provide powerful on-skin signal conditioning, but current fabrication methods are often material-specific: each new polymer semiconductor (PSC) requires a tailored process. The challenge is even greater for complementary OFET circuits, where two PSCs must be patterned sequentially, which often leads to device degradation. Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the first stretchable complementary OTFT neuron circuit, where the output frequency is modulated by the input current to mimic neuronal signal processing. This scalable approach can be readily extended to diverse high-performance stretchable materials, accelerating the development and manufacturing of skin-like electronics.

Abstract: Thermal energy storage (TES) systems coupled with heat pumps offer significant potential for improving building energy efficiency by shifting electricity demand to off-peak hours. However, conventional operating strategies maintain conservatively low chilled water temperatures throughout the cooling season, a practice that results in suboptimal heat pump performance. This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 °C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance. This study contributes a practical methodology for optimizing TES charging temperatures in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems while maintaining indoor setpoint temperatures.

Abstract: In many scenarios, it is natural to model a plant's dynamical behavior using a hybrid dynamical system influenced by exogenous continuous-time inputs. While solution concepts and analytical tools for existence and completeness are well established for autonomous hybrid systems, corresponding results for hybrid dynamical systems involving continuous-time inputs are generally lacking. This work aims to address this gap. We first formalize notions of a solution for such systems. We then provide conditions that guarantee the existence and forward completeness of solutions. Moreover, we leverage results and ideas from viability theory to present more explicit conditions in terms of various tangent cone formulations. Variants are provided that depend on the regularity of the exogenous input signals.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of modern control theory to improve the precision of spacecraft orbit maneuvers in low Earth orbit under the influence of solar radiation pressure. A full order observer based feedback control framework is developed to estimate system states and compensate for external disturbances during the trajectory correction phase following main engine cut off. The maneuver trajectory is generated using Lambert guidance, while the observer based controller ensures accurate tracking of the target orbit despite SRP perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed design is assessed through stability, observability, and controllability analyses. Stability is validated by step-response simulations and eigenvalue distributions of the system dynamics. Observability is demonstrated through state matrix rank analysis, confirming complete state estimation. Controllability is verified using state feedback rank conditions and corresponding control performance plots. Comparative simulations highlight that, in contrast to uncontrolled or conventional control cases, the observer based controller achieves improved trajectory accuracy and robust disturbance rejection with moderate control effort. These findings indicate that observer-based feedback control offers a reliable and scalable solution for precision orbital maneuvering in LEO missions subject to environmental disturbances.

Abstract: This paper considers data-based solutions of linear-quadratic nonzero-sum differential games. Two cases are considered. First, the deterministic game is solved and Nash equilibrium strategies are obtained by using persistently excited data from the multiagent system. Then, a stochastic formulation of the game is considered, where each agent measures a different noisy output signal and state observers must be designed for each player. It is shown that the proposed data-based solutions of these games are equivalent to known model-based procedures. The resulting data-based solutions are validated in a numerical experiment.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了在学习过程中持续收敛、满足硬约束且可扩展到状态、输入相关扰动的不确定性场景，为管道式MPC提供了可验证的安全保证

Abstract: We develop a learning-based framework for constructing shrinking disturbance-invariant tubes under state- and input-dependent uncertainty, intended as a building block for tube Model Predictive Control (MPC), and certify safety via a lifted, isotone (order-preserving) fixed-point map. Gaussian Process (GP) posteriors become $(1-α)$ credible ellipsoids, then polytopic outer sets for deterministic set operations. A two-time-scale scheme separates learning epochs, where these polytopes are frozen, from an inner, outside-in iteration that converges to a compact fixed point $Z^\star\!\subseteq\!\mathcal G$; its state projection is RPI for the plant. As data accumulate, disturbance polytopes tighten, and the associated tubes nest monotonically, resolving the circular dependence between the set to be verified and the disturbance model while preserving hard constraints. A double-integrator study illustrates shrinking tube cross-sections in data-rich regions while maintaining invariance.

Method: 利用缩减阶线性时不变模型对同步发电机(SG)与逆变器的频率动态进行分析，结合频域与时域方法进行研究。

Result: 发现全逆变器系统的干扰响应更加局部化，系统可控性更强，这两种特性与逆变器低有效惯量相关，并对未来宽域控制系统设计产生重要影响。

Conclusion: 提示在全逆变器系统中应将反馈测量布置靠近发电机节点，以有效抑制干扰；同时宽域控制系统应优先使用逆变器实现控制，以利用其更高的系统可控性。

Abstract: The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the entropy of a hard random geometric graph (RGG), a commonly used model for spatial networks, where the connectivity is governed by the distances between the nodes. Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \sim dm \log_2m$ for $0 < r \leq 1/4$ in the case of $\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\log m$ for all $0<r<1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $Ω((d-1)m \log_2m)$ for $0 < r \leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.

Abstract: In antiquity, the seal embodied trust, secrecy, and integrity in safeguarding the exchange of letters and messages. The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups. The use of continuous geometric structures,non-linear operator compositions,and enforced blockwise serialization distinguishes this approach from existing quantum-safe cryptographic proposals based on primary discrete algebraic assumptions.

Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.

Motivation: 传统tANS在特定概率分布下受限，力求发现更广泛的编码类，以提升实用性与压缩效率。

Method: 以反向顺序对符号序列编码、正向顺序解码，采用多状态的自适应编码表，设计比tANS更通用的编码类。

Result: 对i.i.d.源，AEDS两状态可在根子概率>0.61803时取得比Huffman更短平均码长；五状态在>0.56984时亦如此；并给出上界和$O(1/N)$收敛速率。

Conclusion: AEDS是一种将tANS拓展至更广泛编码类别的无损压缩方案，能够在特定子树概率条件下优于Huffman编码，并与tANS一样在状态数增大时以$O(1/N)$速度逼近熵。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lossless data compression coding scheme named an asymmetric encoding-decoding scheme (AEDS), which can be considered as a generalization of tANS (tabled variant of asymmetric numeral systems). In the AEDS, a data sequence $\bm{s}=s_1s_2\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \cdots, 2,1$, while $\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.

TL;DR: A practical, low‑overhead map that jointly encodes channel and traffic from standard logs to enable efficient, autonomous network optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future 5G/6G networks require decisions in highly dynamic environments with strict constraints; prior knowledge of spatial‑temporal channel and demand variations is essential for efficient optimization.

Method: Construction of perception embedding map (PEM) from standard‑compliant measurements (measurement reports, scheduling/QoS logs) combined into a grid‑level spatio‑temporal representation that embeds fine‑grained channel statistics and traffic patterns.

Result: PEM demonstrates a favorable accuracy‑cost trade‑off, outperforming existing site‑specific channel maps and digital‑twin replicas by jointly embedding channel and traffic and leveraging standard measurements, thus reducing training overhead and signaling.

Conclusion: PEM enables site‑specific, low‑overhead, joint embedding of channel and traffic knowledge, supporting energy‑efficient, low‑latency optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers with reduced training overhead and signaling.

Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.

Abstract: We study the impact of imperfect line-of-sight (LoS) phase tracking on the performance of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature. Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.

Abstract: We revisit the Gray-Wyner lossy source coding problem and derive the first-order asymptotic optimal rate-distortion-perception region when additional perception constraints are imposed on reproduced source sequences. The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) enhances wireless coverage through directional gain steering, yet suffers from performance degradation under physical blockages. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.

Abstract: An information-theoretic framework is introduced to analyze last-layer embedding, focusing on learned representations for regression tasks. We define representation-rate and derive limits on the reliability with which input-output information can be represented as is inherently determined by the input-source entropy. We further define representation capacity in a perturbed setting, and representation rate-distortion for a compressed output. We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.

Abstract: Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) form the foundation of modern communication systems, yet no single code family simultaneously optimizes all performance aspects. This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.

Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.

Abstract: To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.

Abstract: We study joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through the empirical coordination framework. More specifically, we aim at determining the empirical distributions of source and channel symbols that can be induced by a coding scheme. We consider strictly causal encoders that generate channel inputs, without access to the past channel states, henceforth driving the current Markov state evolution. Our main result is the single-letter inner and outer bounds of the set of achievable joint distributions, coordinating all the symbols in the network. To establish the inner bound, we introduce a new notion of typicality, the input-driven Markov typicality, and develop its fundamental properties. Contrary to the classical block-Markov coding schemes that rely on blockwise independence for discrete memoryless channels, our analysis directly exploits the Markov channel structure and improves beyond the independence-based arguments.

Abstract: arXiv is the largest open-access repository for scientific literature. When submitting a paper, authors upload the manuscript's source files, from which the final PDF is compiled. These source files are also publicly downloadable, potentially exposing data unrelated to the published paper -- such as figures, documents, or comments -- that may unintentionally reveal confidential information or simply waste storage space. We thus ask ourselves: "What can be found within the source files of arXiv submissions?"
  We present a longitudinal analysis of ~600,000 submissions appeared on arXiv between 2015--2025. For each submission, we examine the uploaded source files to quantify and characterize data not required for producing the respective PDF. On average, 27% of the data in each submission are unnecessary, totaling >580 GB of redundant content across our dataset. Qualitative inspection reveals the presence of offensive/inappropriate text (e.g., "WTF does this mean?") and experimental details that could disclose ongoing research. We have contacted arXiv's leadership team, as well as the authors of affected papers to alert them of these issues. Finally, we propose recommendations and an automated tool to detect and analyze arXiv submissions residual data at scale, aiming to improve data hygiene in the arXiv's ecosystem.

Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.

Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.

Abstract: India is the second largest producer of onions in the world, contributing over 26 million tonnes annually. However, during storage, approximately 30-40% of onions are lost due to rotting, sprouting, and weight loss. Despite being a major producer, conventional storage methods are either low-cost but ineffective (traditional storage with 40% spoilage) or highly effective but prohibitively expensive for small farmers (cold storage). This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based smart onion storage system that monitors and automatically regulates environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, and spoilage gases using ESP32 microcontroller, DHT22 sensor, MQ-135 gas sensor, and UV-C disinfection technology. The proposed system aims to reduce onion spoilage to 15-20% from the current 40-45% wastage rate while remaining affordable for small and marginal farmers who constitute the majority in India. The system is designed to be cost-effective (estimated 60k-70k INR), energy-efficient, farmer-friendly, and solar-powered.

Abstract: Rotating bearings play an important role in modern industries, but have a high probability of occurrence of defects because they operate at high speed, high load, and poor operating environments. Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest.

Abstract: Sparse recovery methods are essential for channel estimation and localization in modern communication systems, but their reliability relies on accurate physical models, which are rarely perfectly known. Their computational complexity also grows rapidly with the dictionary dimensions in large MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose MOMPnet, a novel unfolded sparse recovery framework that addresses both the reliability and complexity challenges of traditional methods. By integrating deep unfolding with data-driven dictionary learning, MOMPnet mitigates hardware impairments while preserving interpretability. Instead of a single large dictionary, multiple smaller, independent dictionaries are employed, enabling a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. The proposed unfolded network is evaluated on realistic channel data against multiple baselines, demonstrating its strong performance and potential.

This algorithm allows sensors to activate only when an event occurs, while preserving critical information for detecting defects, such as those in the surface structures of buildings and ensuring accuracy for further predictions.

Abstract: AI-communication integration is widely regarded as a core enabling technology for 6G. Most existing AI-based physical-layer designs rely on task-specific models that are separately tailored to individual modules, resulting in poor generalization. In contrast, communication systems are inherently general-purpose and should support broad applicability and robustness across diverse scenarios. Foundation models offer a promising solution through strong reasoning and generalization, yet wireless-system constraints hinder a direct transfer of large language model (LLM)-style success to the wireless domain. Therefore, we introduce the concept of large wireless foundation models (LWFMs) and present a novel framework for empowering the physical layer with foundation models under wireless constraints. Specifically, we propose two paradigms for realizing LWFMs, including leveraging existing general-purpose foundation models and building novel wireless foundation models. Based on recent progress, we distill two roadmaps for each paradigm and formulate design principles under wireless constraints. We further provide case studies of LWFM-empowered wireless systems to intuitively validate their advantages. Finally, we characterize the notion of "large" in LWFMs through a multidimensional analysis of existing work and outline promising directions for future research.

Currently, accurate Wi-Fi tracking methods rely primarily on fine-grained velocity features. However, such velocity-based approaches suffer from the problem of accumulative errors, making it challenging to stably track users' trajectories over a long period of time. This paper presents DuTrack, a fusion-based tracking system for stable human tracking. The fundamental idea is to leverage the ubiquitous acoustic signals in households to rectify the accumulative Wi-Fi tracking error. Theoretically, Wi-Fi sensing in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios can be modeled as elliptical Fresnel zones and hyperbolic zones, respectively. By designing acoustic sensing signals, we are able to model the acoustic sensing zones as a series of hyperbolic clusters. We reveal how to fuse the fields of electromagnetic waves and mechanical waves, and establish the optimization equation. Next, we design a data-driven architecture to solve the aforementioned optimization equation. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal tracking scheme exhibits superior performance. We achieve a 89.37% reduction in median tracking error compared to model-based methods and a 65.02% reduction compared to data-driven methods.

Conclusion: 使用异质可见光通信-VLC-RF架构和RBMM算法，可将平均任务处理延迟降低约15%

Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm for reducing the computation burden of vehicles, thus supporting delay-sensitive services in next-generation transportation networks. However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing technology enables non-intrusive, continuous monitoring of user locations and activities, which supports diverse smart home applications. Since different sensing tasks exhibit contextual relationships, their integration can enhance individual module performance. However, integrating sensing tasks across different research efforts faces challenges due to the absence of two key elements. The first is a unified architecture that captures the fundamental nature shared across diverse sensing tasks. The second is an extensible pipeline that can integrate sensing methodologies proposed in potential future research. This paper presents Uni-Fi, an extensible framework for multi-task Wi-Fi sensing integration. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we propose a unified theoretical framework that reveals the fundamental differences between single-task and multi-task sensing. Second, we develop a scalable sensing pipeline that automatically generates multi-task sensing solvers, enabling seamless integration of multiple sensing models. Experimental results show that Uni-Fi achieves robust performance across tasks, with a localization error of approximately 0.54 meters, 98.34 percent accuracy for activity classification, and 98.57 percent accuracy for presence detection.

Conclusion: 本文证明了在MiLAC辅助MIMO系统中，可通过在模拟域设计培训预加器和组合器，实现与数字等效的LS和MMSE信道估计，同时显著降低计算复杂度、硬件需求与PAPR。

Abstract: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Numerical results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed schemes.

Abstract: Bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables efficient reuse of the existing cellular infrastructure and is likely to play an important role in future sensing networks. In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link. Simulation results validate our approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect the sensing performance.

Motivation: 标准DMD在噪声下性能恶化；现有鲁棒变体改进有限且不保证低维表达真实性。

Method: ①预处理阶段：凸优化去噪；②降维阶段：以稀疏加权方式链接鲁棒模式与原始观测，构造低维表达；两者均采用预条件化原始-双重分裂求解。

Result: 在流体动力学数据集上，CR‑DMD在模式准确性与低维重构保真度方面持续优于最新的鲁棒DMD方法。

Conclusion: CR‑DMD通过两阶段凸优化显著提升在混合噪声环境下DMD的模式提取与低维表示质量，优于现有鲁棒DMD方法。

Abstract: We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband liquid crystal (LC) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) operating around 60 GHz and scaling up to 750 radiating elements. The RISs employ a delay line architecture (DLA) that decouples the phase shifting and radiating layer, enabling wide bandwidth, continuous phase control exceeding 360°, and fast response times with a micrometer-thin LC layer of 4.6 micrometer. Two prototypes with 120 and 750 elements are realized using identical unit cells and column-wise biasing. Measurements demonstrate beam steering over +-60° and -3 dB bandwidths exceeding 9% for both apertures, confirming the scalability of the proposed architecture. On top of a measured nanowatt power consumption per unit cell, aperture efficiencies above 20% are predicted by simulations. While the measured efficiencies are reduced to 9.2% and 2.6%, a detailed analysis verifies that this reduction can be attributed to technological challenges in a laboratory environment. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between the applied DLA-based LC-RIS and a conventional approach highlights the superior potential of applied architecture.

Abstract: This paper studies microfluidic molecular communication receivers with finite-capacity Langmuir adsorption driven by an effective surface concentration. In the reaction-limited regime, we derive a closed-form single-pulse response kernel and a symbol-rate recursion for on-off keying that explicitly exposes channel memory and inter-symbol interference. We further develop short-pulse and long-pulse approximations, revealing an interference asymmetry in the long-pulse regime due to saturation. To account for stochasticity, we adopt a finite-receptor binomial counting model, employ pulse-end sampling, and propose a low-complexity midpoint-threshold detector that reduces to a fixed threshold when interference is negligible. Numerical results corroborate the proposed characterization and quantify detection performance versus pulse and symbol durations.

Conclusion: 我们提出的三类可解析的全局平滑双射显著提升了正则化流的表达能力与可逆性，并通过径向流与目标分布匹配时显著减少参数。

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Result: Compressed TN models matched deep learning accuracy, retained performance after quantization, and when synthesized, used modest FPGA resources with sub‑microsecond response times.

Conclusion: Tensor Network models (MPS and TTN) can achieve high quality jet tagging with sub‑microsecond latency on FPGAs, making them viable for the HL‑LHC Level‑1 trigger.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.

Conclusion: 该论文提出并演化了基于值级并行（VLP）的非线性近似和架构Mugi，对LLM推理提升吞吐量与能效至关重要。

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

Conclusion: AI合作者可显著提升人机协作拓扑优化的设计质量与制造可行性

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

Conclusion: 通过将准确度与一致性结合的AC分数进行优化，改进的ARIMA模型在M4 Hourly基准上显著降低了预测波动，同时保持或提升了点预测精度。

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

Result: 在五个受限数据的真实世界案例中，新的算法相较传统指数时间算法实现了超过 80%% 的计算效率提升；基于 Action Shapley 的数据选择策略在性能上稳健优于人工经验式方法。

Conclusion: Action Shapley 提供了一种有效且高效的无偏训练数据选择度量，显著提升了世界模型训练的性能与效率。

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

Motivation: ConvLSTM2D在处理地球观测数据时存在高复杂度、局部感受野限制和难以捕捉长距离气候关联等问题，需要更高效且可解释的模型。

Method: 提出FAConvLSTM——一个采用因子化注意力、轻量化1×1瓶颈、共享深度可分离卷积、膨胀多尺度分支、SE重校正以及轴向稀疏注意力的卷积LSTM。

Result: 实验表明FAConvLSTM在多变量时空气候数据上的表示更稳定、可解释且鲁棒，并大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM在高分辨率多变量地球观测数据上的时空表示学习相比传统的ConvLSTM2D更稳定、可解释且鲁棒，并且显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

### [67] [HOSL: Hybrid-Order Split Learning for Memory-Constrained Edge Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10940)
*Aakriti,Zhe Li,Dandan Liang,Chao Huang,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOSL merges ZO‑client and FO‑server strategies to cut client memory 3.7×, keep accuracy near FO, and beat pure ZO by 15.55%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slack resources on edge devices demand memory‐efficient split learning; first‑order methods need heavy activation storage, zeroth‑order reduces memory but convergence suffers.

Method: Hybrid‑order split learning (HOSL) applies zeroth‑order optimization on the client to avoid back‑propagation and memory use, while using first‑order optimization on the server for fast convergence, with memory‑efficient gradient estimation.

Result: HOSL achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal O(\sqrt{d_c/(TQ)})$, reducing client GPU memory by up to 3.7× versus FO and maintaining <4.23% accuracy loss; outperforms ZO by up to 15.55% on OPT 125M/1.3B benchmarks across 6 tasks.

Conclusion: Combining ZO on clients and FO on servers offers a practical trade‑off between memory efficiency and performance in split LLM training, enabling effective edge‑device collaboration.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.

Method: 通过数值实验与可解析物理模型分析SGD学习动力学，揭示非平衡机制及瞬态冻结现象

Result: 发现SGD在训练初期频繁跳出尖锐谷域趋向平坦区域，并随着能量壁垒累积导致固定在单个基盆，增加噪声可延迟冻结并提升收敛平坦极小值的能力

Conclusion: 构建了学习动力学、损失景观几何与泛化关联的统一物理框架，为优化算法设计提供原则

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

Motivation: 极端事件后恢复关键负荷需要自适应控制，但可再生能源的不确定性、可调度资源有限以及非线性动力学使恢复变得困难；传统RL在泛化和迁移训练上存在局限。

Method: 通过将一阶元学习与进化策略相结合，开发了无梯度计算的元指导遗传无梯度强化学习(MGF-RL)框架；该框架利用历史停电经验学习可迁移初始化，快速适应未知场景，支持非线性受限分布系统动态的可扩展策略搜索。

Conclusion: MGF-RL显著提升了在极端事件后的负荷恢复效率，显示出在高可再生能源配比的配电网中实现实时负荷恢复的潜力。

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

Conclusion: 将DP噪声限定在高效子空间，可以在保留正式DP保证的同时大幅降低噪声幅度，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

Method: 采用变分推断算法学习软贝叶斯上下文树（Soft‑BCT）。

Result: 在若干真实数据集上，Soft‑BCT表现几乎持平或优于传统BCT。

Conclusion: Soft-BCT模型在实值时间序列上的性能与现有BCT相当或优于之。

Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series. A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TimeMAR-BC5B.

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning on large language models faces rank heterogeneity due to differing low‑rank configurations across clients, making aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable.

Method: Propose Selective Dual‑module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA) that splits each client adapter into a shared global module (aggregate‑able) and a private local module. Only the global module is aligned and aggregated; differential privacy noise is injected solely into the global module.

Result: Experiments on GLUE show SDFLoRA outperforms existing federated LoRA baselines and achieves a superior utility‑privacy trade‑off.

Conclusion: A rank‑heterogeneity‑aware federated LoRA framework that separates shared knowledge from client‑specific adaptation, yielding robust performance and stronger privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种完全数据驱动、无需额外测量或数值模拟的PDE算子学习方案，天然可扩展到三维和复杂几何。

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

Result: 在 SQuAD 上, PaST 比最先进的自编辑 SFT 提升最多 9.9 分；在 LooGLE 长上下文 QA 上提升 8.0 分；在 ToolBench 零样本设置下平均提升 10.3 分，并在工具类别上均有持续增益，展现了优越的规模化和跨域迁移能力。

Conclusion: PaST 通过将源域提取的 Skill Vector 线性注入目标模型，实现了知识更新后对问题回答和决策能力的显著提升，证明了参数更新与 RL 的正交性可驱动高效的技能迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms.

TL;DR: FORESTLLM在有限标签的表格学习中，通过LLM在训练期间进行语义分割与叶节点稳健化，构建轻量可解释树模型，取得了最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在多个少样本分类与回归基准上，FORESTLLM达到了领先的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FORESTLLM显著提升了少样本表格数据学习的性能，并实现了对树模型结构与大语言模型知识的有效融合，实现在测试时无需LLM运行的轻量化可解释模型。

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RAG在DLM上应用需要防止语义漂移，SPREAD框架用查询相关性引导去噪，提升答案精确度并降低漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索检索增强生成（RAG）方案对扩散语言模型（DLM）在自然语言处理中的提升潜力，弥补其与大语言模型（LLM）解码差异导致的研究空白。

Method: 系统性对DLM在RAG框架下进行评估，发现生成“语义漂移”现象，因噪声抑制过程未维持与查询语义的一致。提出SPREAD框架，采用查询相关性引导的去噪策略，确保生成始终契合查询语义。

Result: SPREAD显著提高生成精度，缓解RSD问题，实验结果验证其在RAG框架中的有效性。

Conclusion: DLM+RAG可提升上下文依赖性，但需解决语义漂移；SPREAD通过语义保持去噪有效改善性能，展示了RAG与DLM结合的可行性与潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Diffusion Value Function that diffuses rewards over influence graphs, providing a scalable, well‑defined per‑agent critic; used in DA2C+LD‑GNN to outperform baselines up to 11% in distributed tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global critics give weak signals; local critics hard to estimate or ill‑behaved in long horizons—need factored, well‑defined value functions for structured interactions.

Method: Define DVF via temporal discounting and spatial attenuation on influence graphs, prove Bellman fix‑point, use GNN to estimate; build DA2C and LD‑GNN for decentralized control.

Result: Across firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks, DA2C improves average reward up to 11% over local/global critic baselines; scalable with GNNs.

Conclusion: Diffusion Value Function enables clearer per-agent credit assignment in large-scale MARL, enabling superior learning with decentralized actors.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并提升 FNO 在分布转移、长周期滚动和结构扰动下的鲁棒性，为 operator 学习提供更可靠的模型设计方向。

Method: 利用五类 PDE 家族（离散、椭圆、多尺度流体、金融与混沌系统）建立系统性压力测试框架，涵盖参数偏移、边界/终端条件变更、分辨率外推与谱分析以及迭代滚动等情景，评估 1000 训练模型的表现。

Result: 分布转移可导致误差提升十倍以上；分辨率改变主要聚焦于高频模态误差；输入扰动一般不放大误差，单极 Poisson 等极端情形仍有困扰。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了 Fourier Neural Operators 在面对参数、边界条件及分辨率等分布转移时易出现错误率显著升高的脆弱性，并指出高频模式尤易受影响；输入扰动对整体误差影响有限，但特殊局部扰动仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

TL;DR: 对无条件分数基扩散模型进行集成实验，发现集成能提高得分匹配和似然，却并不一定提升感知质量（FID），在表格数据上有不同表现。理论上解释了分数模型求和的效果，为未来模型组成与指导技术提供启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型的高质量样本生成能力提升，人们越来越关注构建更强大的模型。对监督学习模型已有的集成方法在无监督分数基扩散模型中应用相对缺乏，应探讨其是否能改善生成模型性能，尤其是感知质量指标。

Method: 对无条件分数基扩散模型应用多种聚合策略（Deep Ensembles、Monte Carlo Dropout）进行实验，评估得分匹配损失、模型似然以及感知质量指标（FID）在CIFAR‑10与FFHQ上的表现，同时在表格数据集使用随机森林检验聚合效果，并给出分数模型求和的理论分析。

Result: 实验显示，尽管集成可降低得分匹配损失并提升似然，但在图像数据集上的FID指标并未表现出持续的提升。在表格数据上，单一聚合方法表现最佳。理论分析进一步解释了分数模型求和对集成效果的影响，并为指导等模型组合策略提供了洞见。

Conclusion: 在无条件分数基扩散模型中，打包（ensemble）可提升得分匹配损失和模型似然，但并不一定提升感知质量指标，如FID。根据不同聚合规则（Deep Ensembles、Monte Carlo Dropout）在CIFAR-10与FFHQ数据集验证，实验结果大致一致。额外研究了表格数据上的随机森林并发现单一聚合策略优于其他方法。本文还对分数模型求和提供了理论见解，对融合策略以及指导（guidance）等模型组合技术具有启示。

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

TL;DR: LRKV通过低秩KV共享降低内存，保持功能多样性，显著提升预训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer预训练受限于KV缓存的显存与计算瓶颈，需要一种在不牺牲模型表现的前提下降低KV缓存需求的注意力机制。

Method: 在多头注意力中加入共享高秩KV投影并加上低秩、头特定残差，从而实现KV权重的低秩化，同时维持全标记级独立性。

Result: 在大规模预训练实验中，LRKV比传统注意力、MQA/GQA及MLA取得更快的损失下降、更低的验证困惑度以及更强的下游任务性能。2.5B规模下，LRKV使用约一半KV缓存，训练累计FLOPs相对标准注意力减少20-25%。

Conclusion: LRKV是一种低秩键值适配技术，可在保持完整标记级分辨率的同时显著减少Transformer KV缓存内存使用，提升预训练速度和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.
