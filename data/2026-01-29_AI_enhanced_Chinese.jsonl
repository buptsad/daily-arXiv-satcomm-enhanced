Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $\u03b3$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $\u03b3\\to \\infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $\u0398(\u03b3)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \u03b3)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $\u03b3$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u03b3\u7684\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8eCuSum\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230 ADD \u4e0e AT2FA \u7684\u65b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9690\u853d\u4e0b ADD \u221d \u03b3\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4e3a O(log \u03b3)\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u3001\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u53ef\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8b66\u544a\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u5df2\u77e5\u4e14\u5bf9\u624b\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u540e\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u853d\u6027\u6311\u6218\u7684\u60c5\u51b5", "method": "\u5728CuSum\u57fa\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf (ADD) \u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u65f6\u95f4 (AT2FA) \u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u03b3\u2192\u221e\u65f6\u540e\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u8d8b\u8fd1\u524d\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e34\u754c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u6761\u4ef6", "result": "\u5f97\u5230ADD\u4e0eAT2FA \u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6e10\u8fd1\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5728\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u624b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b ADD \u4e3a \u0398(\u03b3) \u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4e3a O(log \u03b3)\u3002\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u51faADD\u968fKL\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u03b3\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u9690\u853d\u5bf9\u624b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u540e\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u8d8b\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u853d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

At the same time, network energy savings (NES) is essential in reducing the operational costs and meeting the sustainability goals of network operators. In this regard, we propose a dynamic scheme for joint antenna and power adaptation to improve NES from a user scheduling and resource allocation perspective. Antenna adaptation is performed using the multiple channel state information resource signal (CSI-RS) framework. Furthermore, the recently introduced transmit power-aware link adaptation scheme, referred to as POLITE for short, is used as the power adaptation technique. The proposed scheme adapts to variations in users' instantaneous traffic and channel conditions to opportunistically maximize NES while also inherently accounting for the user throughput. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme consistently achieves a balance between NES and user perceived throughput (UPT) for different network load conditions. Especially in low and light load conditions, the proposed scheme significantly improves the intra-cell interference and boosts the overall NES, while ensuring that UPT is unaffected.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

LCD codes have a trivial hull so they are counterparts of self-orthogonal codes. So it is a natural question whether one can embed linear codes into optimal LCD codes. To answer it, we first determine the number of columns to be added to a generator matrix of a linear code in order to embed the given code into an LCD code. Then we characterize all possible forms of shortest LCD embeddings of a linear code. As examples, we start from binary and ternary Hamming codes of small lengths and obtain optimal LCD codes with minimum distance 4. Furthermore, we find new ternary LCD codes with parameters including $[23, 4, 14]$, $[23, 5, 12]$, $[24, 6, 12]$, and $[25, 5, 14]$ and a new quaternary LCD $[21, 10, 8]$ code, each of which has minimum distance one greater than those of known codes.

In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations.

It is well known that if the eavesdropper experiences less channel noise than the legitimate receiver, then it is impossible for the transmitter to achieve positive secrecy rates. A known solution to this issue consists in involving a second transmitter, referred to as a helper, to help the first transmitter to achieve security. While such a solution has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime and via non-constructive coding schemes, in this paper, for the first time, we design explicit and short blocklength codes using deep learning and cryptographic tools to demonstrate the benefit and practicality of cooperation between two transmitters over the wiretap channel. Specifically, our proposed codes show strict improvement in terms of information leakage compared to existing codes that do not consider a helper. Our code design approach relies on a reliability layer, implemented with an autoencoder architecture based on the successive interference cancellation method, and a security layer implemented with universal hash functions. We also propose an alternative autoencoder architecture that significantly reduces training time by allowing the decoders to independently estimate messages without successively canceling interference by the receiver during training. Additionally, we show that our code design is also applicable to the multiple access wiretap channel with helpers, where two transmitters send confidential messages to the legitimate receiver.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The paper describes the origin of these perturbations and how they affect the dynamics of the biomolecular ``plant'' to be controlled. A variety of biomolecular control implementations are then introduced to achieve robustness of the plant's output to perturbations and are grouped into feedback and feedforward control architectures. Although sophisticated control laws can be implemented in a computer today, they cannot be necessarily implemented inside the cell via biomolecular processes. This fact constraints the set of feasible control laws to those realizable through biomolecular processes that can be engineered with synthetic biology. After reviewing biomolecular feedback and feedforward control implementations, mostly focusing on the author's own work, the paper illustrates the application of such control strategies to cell fate reprogramming. Within this context, a master regulatory factor needs to be controlled at a specific level inside the cell in order to reprogram skin cells to pluripotent stem cells.

This study benchmarks various Llama model variants against the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications framework, evaluating threat detection accuracy, response safety, and computational overhead. Using the FABRIC testbed with NVIDIA A30 GPUs, we tested five standard Llama models and five Llama Guard variants on 100 adversarial prompts covering ten vulnerability categories. Our results reveal significant differences in security performance: the compact Llama-Guard-3-1B model achieved the highest detection rate of 76% with minimal latency (0.165s per test), whereas base models such as Llama-3.1-8B failed to detect threats (0% accuracy) despite longer inference times (0.754s). We observe an inverse relationship between model size and security effectiveness, suggesting that smaller, specialized models often outperform larger general-purpose ones in security tasks.

To enhance fusion efficiency, a reconfigurable metasurface is positioned in the near-field of a few receive antennas, enabling a holographic architecture that harnesses large-aperture gains with minimal RF hardware. A generalized likelihood ratio test is derived for fixed metasurface settings, and two low-complexity joint design strategies are proposed to optimize both fusion and metasurface configuration.

However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3DFL\u5f02\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6162\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5f02\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f97\u5230\u5171\u8bc6\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u90bb\u5c45\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u540e\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u90bb\u57df\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DFL\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002"}}

We explain the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon through a concise mathematical argument. This observation has direct implications for estimating random propagation effects such as fading, particularly when reflections off walls are involved.\n  Motivated by understanding intelligent surfaces, we apply this fundamental result to a physical model consisting of a single transmitter between two parallel passive walls. We analyze signal fading due to reflections and observe power oscillations resulting from wall reflections -- a phenomenon long studied in waveguides but relatively unexplored in wireless networks.

While Layer-coded Hybrid ARQ (L-HARQ) enhances reliability, its backtracking decoding introduces age ambiguity, undermining the standard Age of Information (AoI) metric and obscuring the critical trade-off between data freshness and transmission efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel cross-layer optimization framework centered on a new metric, the Cross-layer Age of Error Information (C-AoEI). We derive a closed-form expression for C-AoEI, explicitly linking freshness to system parameters, establishing an explicit analytical connection between freshness degradation and channel dynamics. Building on this, we develop a packet-level encoded L-HARQ scheme for multi-GBS scenarios and an adaptive algorithm that jointly optimizes coding and decision thresholds. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework: it achieves 31.8% higher transmission efficiency and 17.2% lower C-AoEI than conventional schemes.

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOculomix\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51ed\u501f\u60a3\u8005\u4e0e\u68c0\u67e5\u5c42\u7ea7\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347ViT\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AUROC\u7ea63%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u75c5\u4eba\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9650\u5236CutMix/MixUp\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u75c5\u4eba\u53ca\u540c\u4e00\u68c0\u67e5\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u8f6f\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b", "result": "\u5728Alzeye\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6c11\u65cf\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e0a\uff0cOculomix\u6bd4\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7CutMix\u548cMixUp\u63d0\u5347AUROC\u7ea63%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b", "conclusion": "Oculomix\u5728Oculomics\u9886\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5229\u7528ViT\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u67655\u5e74\u4e3b\u8981\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684AUROC\uff1b"}}

Although control barrier certificates have been extensively studied for safety analysis of control systems, existing work on unknown systems with time delays, particularly in the presence of disturbances, remains limited. The challenge of safety synthesis for such systems stems from two main factors: first, the system's mathematical model is unavailable; and second, the safety conditions should explicitly incorporate the effects of time delays on system evolution during the synthesis process, while remaining robust to unknown disturbances. To address these challenges, we develop a data-driven framework based on Krasovskii control barrier certificates, extending the classical CBC formulation for delay-free systems to explicitly account for time delays by aggregating delayed components within the barrier construction. The proposed framework relies solely on input-state data collected over a finite time horizon, enabling the direct synthesis of RK-CBC and R-SC from observed trajectories without requiring an explicit system model. The synthesis is cast as a data-driven sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, yielding a structured design methodology. As a result, robust safety is guaranteed in the presence of unknown disturbances and time delays over an infinite time horizon.

To adapt JEPA to wireless signals, we introduce a 2D antenna time representation that reshapes multi-antenna IQ streams into structured grids, allowing convolutional processing with block masking and efficient sparse computation over unmasked patches. Building on this representation, we propose novel spatio temporal mask geometries that encode inductive biases across antennas and time. We evaluate WirelessJEPA across six downstream tasks and demonstrate it's robust performance and strong task generalization. Our results establish that JEPA-based learning as a promising direction for building generalizable WFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "WirelessJEPA \u901a\u8fc7 Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture \u4e0e 2D \u5929\u7ebf-\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u906e\u63a9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece IQ \u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u516d\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u79c0\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e JEPA \u65b9\u5411\u6709\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5e7f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u901a\u7528\u800c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5bfb\u6c42\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u5929\u7ebf IQ \u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa WirelessJEPA\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86 2D \u5929\u7ebf-\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u5929\u7ebf IQ \u6d41\u91cd\u5851\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5b50\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u906e\u63a9\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5904\u7406\u672a\u906e\u63a9\u533a\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u906e\u63a9\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee5\u6ce8\u5165\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u9879\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cWirelessJEPA \u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e JEPA \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JEPA-based learning\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e IQ \u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5728\u516d\u9879\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To enforce fairness, we maximize the minimum secrecy throughput across GUs by jointly designing trajectories and communication scheduling. The key difficulty lies in the continuous-time nature of UAV trajectories and the tight space-time coupling between the transmitter and the jammer, which jointly render the problem infinite-dimensional and nonconvex. To address these challenges, we characterize, for the first time, the structure of the optimal trajectories and rigorously prove that they follow a collaborative successive hover-and-fly (co-SHF) structure, where the two UAVs visit a limited number of synchronized co-hovering point pairs, and during each flight segment at least one UAV moves at maximum speed. Leveraging this structure, we reformulate the problem into a finite-dimensional form, without loss of optimality, over hovering and turning points, hovering durations, and scheduling. For tractability, we adopt a minimum-distance approximation of continuous anti-collision constraints and employ concave lower bounds on secrecy throughput within a successive convex approximation (SCA) method, which converges and, thanks to the co-SHF reduction in optimization variables and constraints, achieves low computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with time-discretization and no-jamming benchmarks, the proposed co-SHF design improves the min-secrecy and user fairness while requiring significantly less runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results in phishing URL detection. However, their reasoning capabilities that enabled such performance remain underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Least-to-Most prompting framework for phishing URL detection. In particular, we introduce an \"answer sensitivity\" mechanism that guides Least-to-Most's iterative approach to enhance reasoning and yield higher prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing against a one-shot approach and a supervised model. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the one-shot baseline while achieving performance comparable to that of the supervised model, despite requiring significantly less training data. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis highlights how the iterative reasoning enabled by Least-to-Most, and reinforced by our answer sensitivity mechanism, drives these performance gains. Overall, we show that this simple yet powerful prompting strategy consistently outperforms both one-shot and supervised approaches, despite requiring minimal training or few-shot guidance.

However, recent black-box forgery attacks, where an attacker needs at least one watermarked image and black-box access to the provider's model, can embed the provider's watermark into images not produced by the provider, posing outsized risk to provenance and trust. We propose SemBind, the first defense framework for latent-based watermarks that resists black-box forgery by binding latent signals to image semantics via a learned semantic masker. Trained with contrastive learning, the masker yields near-invariant codes for the same prompt and near-orthogonal codes across prompts; these codes are reshaped and permuted to modulate the target latent before any standard latent-based watermark. SemBind is generally compatible with existing latent-based watermarking schemes and keeps image quality essentially unchanged, while a simple mask-ratio parameter offers a tunable trade-off between anti-forgery strength and robustness. Across four mainstream latent-based watermark methods, our SemBind-enabled anti-forgery variants markedly reduce false acceptance under black-box forgery while providing a controllable robustness-security balance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u6c34\u5370\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7801\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a9\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u62b5\u5fa1\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u56e0\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u592a\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7be1\u6539\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5a01\u80c1\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6e90\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u4efb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u63a9\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00prompt\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7801\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u4e0e\u7f6e\u6362\u6765\u8c03\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u5165\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u5728\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c34\u5370\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6f5c\u5728\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0cSemBind\u660e\u663e\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f2a\u9020\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "SemBind\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u5957\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6c34\u5370\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6e90\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in high-mobility environment such as emerging 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the extreme orbital velocities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites frequently cause the physical Doppler shifts to exceed the fundamental grid range. This Doppler ambiguity induces severe model mismatch and renders traditional MLE channel estimators ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel low-complexity pilot-aided Doppler ambiguity detection and compensation framework. We first mathematically derive the OTFS input-output relationship in the presence of aliasing, revealing that Doppler ambiguity manifests itself as a distinct phase rotation along the delay dimension. Leveraging this insight, we developed a two-stage estimator that utilizes pairwise phase differences between pilot symbols to identify the integer ambiguity, followed by a refined Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for channel recovery. We investigate two pilot arrangements, Embedded Pilot with Guard Zone (EP-GZ) and Data-Surrounded Pilot (DSP), to analyze the trade-off between interference suppression and spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the error floor caused by ambiguity, achieving Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) performance comparable to the exhaustive search benchmark while maintaining a computational complexity similar to standard MLE.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper addresses Doppler ambiguity in OTFS for high\u2011mobility NTN by proposing a low\u2011complexity pilot\u2011based detection and compensation algorithm that restores performance with near\u2011ML complexity.", "motivation": "Emerging 5G NTN with LEO satellites produce Doppler shifts beyond the OTFS grid, causing model mismatch and making conventional MLE channel estimators ineffective.", "method": "1) Derive OTFS input\u2011output with aliasing to show Doppler ambiguity as a phase rotation along delay; 2) 1st stage: use pairwise phase differences of pilots to identify integer ambiguity; 3) 2nd stage: refine channel estimation via MLE; 4) Evaluate two pilot designs (EP\u2011GZ and DSP) for interference vs. spectral efficiency trade\u2011off.", "result": "Simulation validates that the proposed framework eliminates the ambiguity\u2011induced error floor, achieving BER and NMSE similar to exhaustive search while maintaining complexity close to standard MLE.", "conclusion": "Doppler ambiguity in high-mobility OTFS systems can be detected and compensated with a low-complexity, pilot\u2011based two\u2011stage scheme that removes the error floor and reaches performance close to exhaustive search while keeping standard MLE complexity."}}

End-to-end latency, as a key real-time attribute of cause-effect chains, is crucial in many applications. But the analysis of end-to-end latency for cause-effect chains on multicore platforms with shared caches still presents an unresolved issue. Traditional methods typically assume that the worst-case execution time (WCET) of each task in the cause-effect chain is known. However, in the absence of scheduling information, these methods often assume that all shared cache accesses result in misses, leading to an overestimation of WCET and, consequently, affecting the accuracy of end-to-end latency. However, effectively integrating scheduling information into the WCET analysis process of the chains may introduce two challenges: first, how to leverage the structural characteristics of the chains to optimize shared cache analysis, and second, how to improve analysis accuracy while avoiding state space explosion.\n  To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end latency analysis framework designed for multi-chain systems on multicore platforms with shared caches. This framework extracts scheduling information and structural characteristics of cause-effect chains, constructing fine-grained and scalable inter-core memory access contexts at the basic block level for time-sensitive shared cache analysis. This results in more accurate WCET (TSC-WCET) estimates, which are then used to derive the end-to-end latency. Finally, we conduct experiments on dual-core and quad-core systems with various cache configurations, which show that under certain settings, the average maximum end-to-end latency of cause-effect chains is reduced by up to 34% and 26%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u94fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u6838\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927 34% \u7684\u6539\u8fdb", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6838\u5e73\u53f0\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u5757\u5c42\u9762\u6784\u9020\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f38\u7f29\u7684\u8de8\u6838\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684 WCET\uff08TSC-WCET\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7b97\u7ec8\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u6838\u548c\u56db\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7f13\u5b58\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6700\u5927\u7ec8\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e 34% \u4e0e 26%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8de8\u6838\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5171\u4eab\u7f13\u5b58 WCET \u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u6838\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u7ec8\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf"}}

However, such flexibility may introduce timing anomalies, wherein locally reduced execution times can lead to an increase in the overall system execution time. This phenomenon significantly complicates the analysis of Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT), rendering conventional analysis either overly pessimistic or unsafe, and often necessitating exhaustive state-space exploration to ensure correctness.\n  To address this challenge, this paper presents the first timing-anomaly-free dynamic scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous systems, referred to as Deterministic Dynamic Execution. It achieves a safe and tight WCRT estimate through a single offline simulation execution. The core idea is to apply deterministic execution constraints, which partially restrict the resource allocation and execution order of tasks at runtime. Based on a formally defined execution progress model for heterogeneous system scheduling, we prove the correctness of the proposed execution constraints and their ability to eliminate timing anomalies. Furthermore, we propose two methods to generate execution constraints. The first method derives execution constraints directly from the execution traces produced by existing scheduling algorithms. The second method is a heuristic-based approach that constructs execution constraints, enabling further reduction of the WCRT.

These aberrations can be compensated by adjusting electromagnetic lenses, but this requires accurate estimates of the aberration coefficients, which can drift over time. This paper introduces a method for the estimation of aberrations in TEM by leveraging the relationship between an induced electron beam tilt and the resulting image shift. The method uses a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the aberration coefficients from a sequence of image shifts, while accounting for the drift of the aberrations over time. The applied tilt sequence is optimized by minimizing the trace of the predicted error covariance in the KF, which corresponds to the A-optimality criterion in experimental design. We show that this optimization can be performed offline, as the cost criterion is independent of the actual measurements. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based, receding-horizon approach with multi-starts. Additionally, we develop an approach to estimate specimen-dependent noise properties using expectation maximization (EM), which are then used to tailor the tilt pattern optimization to the specific specimen being imaged. The proposed method is validated on a real TEM set-up with several optimized tilt patterns. The results show that optimized patterns significantly outperform naive approaches and that the aberration and drift model accurately captures the underlying physical phenomena.

Elevator builds hub-based topologies in a fully decentralized manner, randomly selecting hubs among participating nodes. These hubs, acting as central nodes connected to the entire network, can be leveraged to accelerate message dissemination. Simulation results have shown that Elevator converges rapidly (within 3--4 cycles) and exhibits robustness against crash failures and churn. However, its resilience to Byzantine adversaries has not been investigated. In this work, we provide the first evaluation of Elevator under Byzantine adversaries and show that even a small fraction (2%) of Byzantine nodes is sufficient to subvert the network. As a result, we introduce LIFT, a new protocol that extends Elevator by employing a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for hub selection, thereby mitigating Byzantine manipulation. In contrast, LIFT withstands adversarial infiltration and remains robust with up to 10% Byzantine nodes. These results highlight the necessity of secure randomness in decentralized hub formation and position LIFT as a more reliable building block for Byzantine-resilient decentralized systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Elevator\u5728Byzantine\u573a\u666f\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff1bLIFT\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6570\u5f3a\u5316Hub\u9009\u53d6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u523010%\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347Elevator\u5728\u9762\u5bf9Byzantine\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5176\u672a\u7814\u7a76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30Elevator\u5728Byzantine\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1LIFT\u6539\u8fdbHub\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u5bc6\u5b89\u5168PRNG\u3002", "result": "Elevator\u4ec5\u97002% Byzantine\u8282\u70b9\u5373\u53ef\u88ab\u7834\u574f\uff1bLIFT\u53ef\u62b5\u5fa1\u6700\u591a10%\u7684Byzantine\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "Elevator\u8106\u5f31\u4e8eByzantine\u653b\u51fb\uff0cLIFT\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168PRNG\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u523010% Byzantine\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u77f3\u3002"}}

The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling.

Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows.

Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality.

Using an open-source testbed built from srsRAN, Open5GS, FlexRIC and strongSwan (with liboqs), we compare three configurations: no IPsec, classical ECDH-based IPsec, and ML-KEM-based IPsec. The study focuses on IPsec tunnel-setup latency and the runtime behaviour of Near-RT RIC xApps under realistic signalling workloads. Results from repeated, automated runs show that ML-KEM integration adds a small overhead to tunnel establishment, which is approximately 3~5 ms in comparison to classical IPsec, while xApp operation and RIC control loops remain stable in our experiments. These findings indicate that ML-KEM based IPsec on the E2 interface is practically feasible and inform quantum-safe migration strategies for O-RAN deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset.

Then, a Private Set Union (PSU), resp. Intersection (PSI), is a protocol that allows parties to jointly compute the union, resp. the intersection, between their private sets. Now a structured PSI, is a PSI where some structure of the sets can allow for more efficient protocols. For instance in Fuzzy PSI, elements only need to be close enough, instead of equal, to be part of the intersection. We present in this paper, Fuzzy PSU protocols (FPSU), able to efficiently take into account approximations in the union. For this, we introduce a new efficient sub-protocol, called Oblivious Key Homomorphic Encryption Retrieval (OKHER), improving on Oblivious Key-Value Retrieval (OKVR) techniques in our setting. In the fuzzy context, the receiver set $X=\\{x_i\\}_{1..n}$ is replaced by ${\\mathcal B}_\u03b4(X)$, the union of $n$ balls of dimension $d$ with radius $\u03b4$, centered at the $x_i$. The sender set is just its $m$ points of dimension $d$. Then the FPSU functionality corresponds to $X \\sqcup \\{y \\in Y, y \\notin {\\mathcal B}_\u03b4(X)\\}$. Thus, we formally define the FPSU functionality and security properties, and propose several protocols tuned to the patterns of the balls using the $l_\\infty$ distance.

To better capture true user satisfaction and business value, net conversion rate (NetCVR), defined as the probability that a clicked item is purchased and not refunded, has been proposed.Unlike CVR, NetCVR prediction involves a more complex multi-stage cascaded delayed feedback process. The two cascaded delays from click to conversion and from conversion to refund have opposite effects, making traditional CVR modeling methods inapplicable. Moreover, the lack of open-source datasets and online continuous training schemes further hinders progress in this area.To address these challenges, we introduce CASCADE (Cascaded Sequences of Conversion and Delayed Refund), the first large-scale open dataset derived from the Taobao app for online continuous NetCVR prediction. Through an in-depth analysis of CASCADE, we identify three key insights: (1) NetCVR exhibits strong temporal dynamics, necessitating online continuous modeling; (2) cascaded modeling of CVR and refund rate outperforms direct NetCVR modeling; and (3) delay time, which correlates with both CVR and refund rate, is an important feature for NetCVR prediction.Based on these insights, we propose TESLA, a continuous NetCVR modeling framework featuring a CVR-refund-rate cascaded architecture, stage-wise debiasing, and a delay-time-aware ranking loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TESLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASCADE, achieving absolute improvements of 12.41 percent in RI-AUC and 14.94 percent in RI-PRAUC on NetCVR prediction.

This security-critical code is modularized in components known as Trusted Applications (TAs). Vulnerabilities in TAs can compromise the TEE and, thus, the entire system. However, the closed-source nature and fragmentation of mobile TEEs severely hinder dynamic analysis of TAs, limiting testing efforts to mostly static analyses. This paper presents T\u00c4MU, a rehosting platform enabling dynamic analysis of TAs, specifically fuzzing and debugging, by interposing their execution at the API layer. To scale to many TAs across different TEEs, T\u00c4MU leverages the standardization of TEE APIs, driven by the GlobalPlatform specifications. For the remaining TEE-specific APIs not shared across different TEEs, T\u00c4MU introduces the notion of greedy high-level emulation, a technique that allows prioritizing manual rehosting efforts based on the potential coverage gain during fuzzing.

Submitted to IEEE", "summary": "This paper proposes a novel multi-mode pinching-antenna systems (PASS) framework. Multiple data streams can be transmitted within a single waveguide through multiple guided modes, thus facilitating efficient multi-user communications through the mode-domain multiplexing. A physic model is derived, which reveals the mode-selective power radiation feature of pinching antennas (PAs). A two-mode PASS enabled two-user downlink communication system is investigated. Considering the mode selectivity of PA power radiation, a practical PA grouping scheme is proposed, where each PA group matches with one specific guided mode and mainly radiates its signal sequentially. Depending on whether the guided mode leaks power to unmatched PAs or not, the proposed PA grouping scheme operates in either the non-leakage or weak-leakage regime. Based on this, the baseband beamforming and PA locations are jointly optimized for sum rate maximization, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. 1) A simple two-PA case in non-leakage regime is first considered. To solve the formulated problem, a channel orthogonality based solution is proposed. The channel orthogonality is ensured by large-scale and wavelength-scale equality constraints on PA locations. Thus, the optimal beamforming reduces to maximum-ratio transmission (MRT). Moreover, the optimal PA locations are obtained via a Newton-based one-dimension search algorithm that enforces two-scale PA-location constraints by Newton's method. 2) A general multi-PA case in both non-leakage and weak-leakage regimes is further considered. A low-complexity particle-swarm optimization with zero-forcing beamforming (PSO-ZF) algorithm is developed, thus effectively tackling the high-oscillatory and strong-coupled problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multi-mode PASS over conventional single-mode PASS and fixed-antenna structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21 PINCH\u2011Antenna \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7528\u6237\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5185\u6a21\u5f0f\u57df\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7684 PA \u5206\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u6781\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u603b\u901f\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4ec5\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u5bfc\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u6ce2\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u540c\u65f6\u627f\u8f7d\u591a\u6761\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u2460\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc PA \u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u2461\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684 PA \u5206\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u5e26\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4e0e\u5929\u7ebf\u5e03\u5c40\u5728\u603b\u901f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u2462\u5728\u4e24\u6781\u5316\u975e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u6e20\u9053\u6b63\u4ea4\u89e3\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u6bd4\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b\u2463\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u8feb\u6ce2\u675f\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\uff08PSO\u2011ZF\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21 PASS \u5728\u975e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e0e\u5f31\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21 PASS \u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u603b\u901f\u7387\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u6700\u4f4e\u901f\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21 pinching\u2011antenna \u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PASS\uff09\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u5f31\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21 PASS \u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u603b\u6570\u636e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

To mitigate this issue, unlearnable examples introduce imperceptible perturbations into data, preventing models from learning effectively. However, existing methods typically rely on deep neural networks as surrogate models for perturbation generation, resulting in significant computational costs. In this work, we propose Perturbation-Induced Linearization (PIL), a computationally efficient yet effective method that generates perturbations using only linear surrogate models. PIL achieves comparable or better performance than existing surrogate-based methods while reducing computational time dramatically. We further reveal a key mechanism underlying unlearnable examples: inducing linearization to deep models, which explains why PIL can achieve competitive results in a very short time. Beyond this, we provide an analysis about the property of unlearnable examples under percentage-based partial perturbation. Our work not only provides a practical approach for data protection but also offers insights into what makes unlearnable examples effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6311\u9009\u6700\u4f18AI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8981\u5728\u964c\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301AI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u524a\u5f31\u5404\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4eff\u771f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76d1\u89c6\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u63a7\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Such systems do not transmit any energy themselves, but rely on a so-called Illuminator-of-Opportunity (IO), for example a commercial TV station. A network of Receiving Nodes (RN) receive the direct signal as well as reflections from possible targets. The RNs transmit information to a Central Node (CN), that performs the final target detection, localization and tracking. A large number of methods and algorithms for target detection and localization have been proposed in the literature. In the present contribution, the focus is on the seminal Extended Cancelation Algorithm (ECA), in which each RN estimates target parameters after canceling interference from the direct-path as well as clutter from unwanted stationary objects. This is done by exploiting a separate Reference Channel (RC), which captures the IO signal without interference apart from receiver noise. We derive the statistical properties of the ECA parameter estimates under the assumption of a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and we give a sufficient condition for the SNR in the RC to enable statistically efficient estimates. The theoretical results are corroborated through computer simulations, which show that the theory agrees well with empirical results above a certain SNR threshold. The results can be used to predict the performance of passive radar systems in given scenarios, which is useful for feasibility studies as well as system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECA \u501f\u52a9\u53c2\u8003\u901a\u9053\u53d6\u6d88\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u901a\u9053 SNR \u9ad8\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u88ab\u52a8\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9690\u853d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u6742\u6ce2\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u53d6\u6d88\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u53d6\u6d88\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ECA\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a5\u6536\u8282\u70b9\uff08RN\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u901a\u9053\uff08RC\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u7167\u660e\u673a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5148\u53d6\u6d88\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6742\u6ce2\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9ad8 SNR \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b ECA \u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53c2\u8003\u901a\u9053 SNR \u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8bbe\u5b9a SNR \u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u901a\u9053\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u53d6\u6d88\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ECA\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9ad8 SNR \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdbSAE\u4ee5\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u853d+\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u201c\u5206\u88c2\u8bcd\u5178\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSAE\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u5206\u88c2\u8bcd\u5178\u201d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u968f\u673a\u906e\u63a9\u548c\u7ec4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684SAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u51fa\u73b0\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bcd\u5178\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6b7b\u4ea1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CLIP\u3001CLAP\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SAE\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u9020\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

However, misconfigurations and malicious actors in these systems pose severe security risks, leading to supply chain attacks. Despite the widespread use of smartphone apps, the security of dependency management systems in the iOS software supply chain has received limited attention. In this paper, we focus on CocoaPods, one of the most widely used dependency management systems for iOS app development, but also examine the security of Carthage and Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM). We demonstrate that iOS apps expose internal package names and versions. Attackers can exploit this leakage to register previously unclaimed dependencies in CocoaPods, enabling remote code execution (RCE) on developer machines and build servers. Additionally, we show that attackers can compromise dependencies by reclaiming abandoned domains and GitHub URLs. Analyzing a dataset of 9,212 apps, we quantify how many apps are susceptible to these vulnerabilities. Further, we inspect the use of vulnerable dependencies within public GitHub repositories. Our findings reveal that popular apps disclose internal dependency information, enabling dependency confusion attacks. Furthermore, we show that hijacking a single CocoaPod library through an abandoned domain could compromise 63 iOS apps, affecting millions of users.

Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework.

We present an empirical benchmarking study of three prominent ledger-based DID methods - Ethereum, Hedera, and XRP Ledger - using reference Software Development Kits (SDKs) under a unified experimental setup. We measure latency, transaction cost, and on-chain metadata exposure, normalizing latency by each platform's block or consensus interval and cost by its native value transfer fee. Privacy leakage is quantified using a Metadata-Leakage Score (MLS), an entropy-based measure expressed in bits per operation.\n  Our results reveal distinct architectural trade-offs. Ethereum enables near-instant, off-chain DID creation, but incurs the highest latency and cost for on-chain lifecycle operations. XRPL delivers deterministic and stable latency with fixed, low fees, yet exhibits higher metadata leakage due to more verbose transaction payloads. Hedera achieves the lowest on-chain latency and low fees with minimal metadata leakage, while occasional variance arises from SDK-side processing and confirmation pipelines.\n  Overall, the findings show that ledger architecture and SDK workflows play a major role in shaping DID latency, cost, and metadata exposure, complementing the effects of the underlying consensus mechanism. These results provide evidence-based insights to support informed selection and configuration of DID systems under performance and privacy constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u3001Hedera\u3001XRP Ledger \u7684 DID \u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\u4f46\u8d39\u7528\u9ad8\uff1bXRP \u4f4e\u8d39\u4f46\u6cc4\u9732\u591a\uff1bHedera \u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u8d39\u4f4e\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "motivation": "DID \u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41\u94fe\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b98\u65b9 SDK \u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u94fe\u5b9e\u73b0 DID \u7684\u521b\u5efa\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u64a4\u9500\u7b49\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u6253\u6837\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf7\u6c42\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4ea4\u6613\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684 Metadata\u2011Leakage Score \u8bc4\u4f30\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u5728\u94fe\u4e0b\u521b\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff0c\u5374\u5728\u94fe\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ca\u8d39\u7528\u6700\u9ad8\uff1bXRP Ledger \u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8d39\u7528\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u8f83\u591a\uff1bHedera \u5177\u5907\u6700\u4f4e\u94fe\u4e0a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4f4e\u8d39\u7528\u4e14\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u6700\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46 SDK \u4fa7\u5904\u7406\u5076\u6709\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u3001Hedera \u4e0e XRP Ledger \u4e09\u5927\u4e3b\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8d26\u672c\u4e0b\u7684 DID \u5904\u7406\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53d6\u820d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u9700\u6c42\u7684 DID \u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions.

We propose RAMBO, a Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian Processes that automatically discovers latent regimes during optimization, each modeled by an independent GP with locally-optimized hyperparameters.

Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits. Given late-stage frailty or cachexia and hemodynamic instability, permutation importance ranked BMI and systolic blood pressure as the strongest associations.

Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories. Then we train a transformer-based policy via a weighted maximum likelihood estimation loss, where the weights are constructed based on the trained value function to steer the suboptimal policies to the optimal ones. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of DIT on both bandit and Markov Decision Process problems.

The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem. We discuss in details the sampling approach, convergence diagnostics, forecasting metrics as well as their computational efficiency and detect possible issues which will be addressed in our future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0Prophet\u4e8ePyMC\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9", "motivation": "Facebook Prophet\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684Bayesian\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u5176API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePyMC\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Prophet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301MAP\u3001\u5168MCMC\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u8fdb\u884c\u9610\u8ff0", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u6536\u655b\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7PyMC\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684Prophet\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83MAP\u3001MCMC\u548c\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SAMA\uff0c\u5229\u7528 DLM \u7684\u591a\u906e\u853d\u7279\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347 30% AUC\uff0c\u663e\u793a DLM \u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136 DLM \u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u906e\u853d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u591a\u91cd\u53ef\u906e\u853d\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "SAMA\uff08Subset\u2011Aggregated Membership Attack\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u906e\u853d\u7a20\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u53d6\u6837\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u62b5\u5fa1\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9006\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u906e\u853d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "SAMA \u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAUC \u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 30%\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8fbe 8 \u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u5728\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 SAMA \u653b\u51fb\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347 AUC \u7ea6 30%\uff0c\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe 8 \u500d\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86 DLM \u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods.

We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "PASS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0eML/CL\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u805a\u7c7b\uff09\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u65e2\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u53c8\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "PASS\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06ML\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4f2a\u70b9\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff08\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u7f18\u89c4\u5219\u4e0eFisher\u2011Rao\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5219\uff09\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6216\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c/CL\u8fdd\u7ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPASS\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027SSE\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u7cbe\u786e\u6216\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u3002", "conclusion": "PASS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u7684ML/CL\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study.

Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin.

While simple retraining dynamics are known to converge linearly when the performative effects are weak ($\u03c1< 1$), the complexity in the regime $\u03c1> 1$ was hitherto open. In this paper, we establish a sharp phase transition: computing an $\u03b5$-performatively stable point is PPAD-complete -- and thus polynomial-time equivalent to Nash equilibria in general-sum games -- even when $\u03c1= 1 + O(\u03b5)$.

Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeRaDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\uff09\u590d\u523b\u591a\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u9891\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u5e73\u8861\u7684KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6311\u9009\u6700\u4f73\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65e2\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u53c8\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5df2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u5408\u672f\u8bed\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u8282\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5355\u4e00\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u03bb\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u5e38\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e0b\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u95ed\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0cDeRaDiff\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u5148\u524d\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u5373\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "DeRaDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u641c\u7d22\u3002"}}

However, sparse MoEs add complexity to training due to (i) new trainable parameters (router weights) that, like all other parameter groups, require hyperparameter (HP) tuning; (ii) new architecture scale dimensions (number of and size of experts) that must be chosen and potentially taken large. To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Spark} (\\textbf{S}trategic \\textbf{P}olicy-\\textbf{A}ware explo\\textbf{R}ation via \\textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization.

The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa.

Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates.

While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the \"Long-Context Tax\" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders (\"reasonable hesitation\"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power.

However, parameter estimation for SDEs typically relies on accurately timestamped observational sequences. When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood.

However, as forecasting models approach diminishing returns in accuracy, a critical yet underexplored opportunity emerges: the strategic use of post-processing. In this paper, we address the last-mile gap in time-series forecasting, which is to improve accuracy and uncertainty without retraining or modifying a deployed backbone. We propose $\u03b4$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $\u03b4$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(\u03b4)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage.

Despite recent advances in XAI have provided some insights, the specific role of attention layers in transformer based LLMs remains underexplored. This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis. In addition, we isolate neurons within attention layers whose activations selectively encode and facilitate the retrieval of context-defining keywords.

In this work, we present Cheap2Rich, a multi-scale data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-fidelity state spaces from sparse sensor histories by combining a fast low-fidelity prior with learned, interpretable discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects. The results highlight a general multi-fidelity framework for data assimilation and system identification in complex multi-scale systems, enabling rapid design exploration and real-time monitoring and control while providing interpretable discrepancy dynamics.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is the camera-ready version. Please refer to the published version for citation once available", "summary": "The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u6570\u72ec\u5206\u914d\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fDDPM\u5f0f\u62bd\u6837\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6807\u51c6\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u4ee3\u8868\u5177\u6709\u6781\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08flow-matching\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6cbf\u9ad8\u65af\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83ODE\u3001SDE\u4ee5\u53caDDPM\u5f0f\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u62bd\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6700\u53ef\u9760\uff1bDDPM\u5f0f\u5148\u7956\u62bd\u6837\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ea6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u542f\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u6570\u72ec\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548cDDPM\u5f0f\u62bd\u6837\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\uff08\u5982\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u72ec\u683c\uff09\u5206\u914d\u975e\u96f6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002"}}

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem.

To overcome this limitation, we propose TimeCatcher, a novel Volatility-Aware Variational Forecasting framework. TimeCatcher extends linear architectures with a variational encoder to capture latent dynamic patterns hidden in historical data and a volatility-aware enhancement mechanism to detect and amplify significant local variations.

Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u517c\u987e\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u5c42\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0cCounterfactual\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u80fd\u591f\u5c55\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5904\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210CF\u65f6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\uff08\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e2a\u4f53\u76f8\u4f3cCF\uff09\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u76f8\u7b49recourse\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u7b49\u9009\u62e9recourse\u3001\u7b49recourse\u6548\u679c\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86CF\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5e73\u5c42\u9762\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\uff08hybrid fairness\uff09\u5728XAI\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u517c\u987e\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff08CF\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e2a\u4f53\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684CF\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u7684recourse\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86CF\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u7ea7\u516c\u5e73\u3002"}}

This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects.

While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods. Finally, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of rank-based trimming via Markov chain theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation.

Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach.

Traditional CPD methods often rely on unsupervised techniques, which lack adaptability to task-specific definitions of change and cannot benefit from user knowledge.

MuRAL-CPD leverages a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition to detect changes across multiple temporal scales and incorporates user feedback to iteratively optimize key hyperparameters. This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability.

However, most practical pipelines stop at supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and fail to reach the reinforcement learning (RL) alignment stage. The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistently strong performance under a low-cost setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u5355\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u548c anchor\u2011conditioned \u81ea\u5df1\u6392\u5e8f\uff0cPU\u2011RL \u84b8\u998f\u5728\u672c\u5730\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684 RL \u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0cRL \u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u653e\u5f03\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u672c\u5730\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff08PU\uff09RL \u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53ea\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u6b21\u6559\u5e08\u751f\u6210 anchor \u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u5728\u672c\u5730\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u6761\u5b66\u751f\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 anchor\u2011conditioned \u81ea\u6211\u6392\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6210\u5bf9\u6216\u5217\u8868\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u79e9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 On\u2011Premise \u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684 RL \u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...).

This structure is especially common in operations research applications such as inventory control, energy storage, and resource allocation, where exogenous randomness (e.g., demand, arrivals, or prices) drives system behavior. Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs. In the tabular case, PEL achieves $\\widetilde{O}(H^2|\u039e|\\sqrt{K})$. For large, continuous endogenous state spaces, we introduce LSVI-PE, a simple linear-approximation method whose regret is polynomial in the feature dimension, exogenous state space, and horizon, independent of the endogenous state and action spaces. Our analysis introduces two new tools: counterfactual trajectories and Bellman-closed feature transport, which together allow greedy policies to have accurate value estimates without optimism. Experiments on synthetic and resource-management tasks show that PEL consistently outperforming baselines. Overall, our results overturn the conventional wisdom that exploration is required, demonstrating that in Exo-MDPs, pure exploitation is enough.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.", "AI": {"tldr": "MORPHIN\u901a\u8fc7\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5148\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7fRL\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea61.7\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "RL\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6539\u53d8\u6216\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5df2\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gridworld\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0cMORPHIN\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6Q-learning\u5feb1.7\u500d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "MORPHIN\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfQ-learning\u3002"}}

Recently, artificial neural network (ANN)-based Cox-PH models have been developed.

The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training. We applied our model, named Cox-MT, to predict the prognosis of several types of cancer using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our single-modal Cox-MT models, utilizing TCGA RNA-seq data or whole slide images, significantly outperformed the existing ANN-based Cox model, Cox-nnet, using the same data set across four types of cancer considered. As the number of unlabeled samples increased, the performance of Cox-MT significantly improved with a given set of labeled data. Furthermore, our multi-modal Cox-MT model demonstrated considerably better performance than the single-modal model.

However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models.

In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4). We also introduce an explicit gradient-based corrective penalty that cancels the covariance induced bias within each update. We prove that buffer partitioning preserves the lower bound property of the maximization objective, and that these constraints mitigate excessive conservatism in extreme OOD areas without altering the core behavior of policy constrained offline reinforcement learning.

This structure prioritizes bounded long-horizon behavior under fully autoregressive inference, a critical requirement for edge deployment where prediction errors accumulate over time. Experiments on non-stationary synthetic time-series data demonstrate that COMET-SG1 achieves competitive short-horizon accuracy while exhibiting significantly reduced long-horizon drift compared to MLP, LSTM, and k-nearest neighbor baselines. With a compact parameter footprint and operations compatible with fixed-point arithmetic, COMET-SG1 provides a practical and interpretable approach for stable autoregressive prediction in edge and embedded AI applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "COMET\u2011SG1 \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u957f\u671f\u6f02\u79fb\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18 AI \u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cCOMET\u2011SG1 \u5728\u77ed\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0e MLP\u3001LSTM\u3001k\u2011NN \u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6f02\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5360\u7528\u5c0f\u4e14\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u5b9a\u70b9\u7b97\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "COMET\u2011SG1 \u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f AI \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u957f\u671f\u6f02\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $\u03b1$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with H\u00f6lder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access.

We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions.

Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts.

In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high similarity between consecutive blocks of a Transformer in all components. In particular, in the decoder, the relationship between the input and output of a Transformer is approximately linear.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Transformer\u5d4c\u5165VAE\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u5757\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5173\u7cfb\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u6784\u6210\u7684VAE\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800cTransformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Transformer\u5d4c\u5165VAE\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf957\u4e2aOpenML CC18\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790Transformer\u5757\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u5c42\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1bTransformer\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5757\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06Transformer\u6574\u5408\u8fdbVAE\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5c42\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14Transformer\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u5757\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u3002"}}

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "ES\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u903c\u8fd1\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\uff1b\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5f97\u4ee5\u590d\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08ES\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff1b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5GRPO\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u53ca\u21132\u8303\u6570\u3002", "result": "ES\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1GRPO\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u9057\u5fd8\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u539f\u56e0\u662fES\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u21132\u8303\u6570\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\u5148\u524d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5316\u5176\u4fdd\u7559\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}
