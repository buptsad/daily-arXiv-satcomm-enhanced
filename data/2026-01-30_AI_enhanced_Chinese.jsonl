Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) attempt to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the model training/fine-tuning dataset, posing serious privacy risks. However, most existing MIA techniques against LLMs rely on sequence-level aggregated prediction statistics, which fail to distinguish prediction improvements caused by generalization from those caused by memorization, leading to low attack effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a novel membership inference approach that captures the token-level probabilities for low-confidence (hard) tokens, where membership signals are more pronounced. By comparing token-level probability improvements at hard tokens between a fine-tuned target model and a pre-trained reference model, HT-MIA isolates strong and robust membership signals that are obscured by prior MIA approaches. Extensive experiments on both domain-specific medical datasets and general-purpose benchmarks demonstrate that HT-MIA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art MIA baselines. We further investigate differentially private training as an effective defense mechanism against MIAs in LLMs. Overall, our HT-MIA framework establishes hard-token based analysis as a state-of-the-art foundation for advancing membership inference attacks and defenses for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "HT-MIA\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\u7684token\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\u8fdb\u884c\u4f1a\u5458\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MIAs\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9020\u6210\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9fine-tuned\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u548cpre-trained\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\u5904token\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5f3a\u800c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHT-MIA\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e03\u5927\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HT-MIA\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5355\u8bcd\u4e0a\u6355\u83b7token\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

In the context of corporate data management, the concept of sensitivity awareness has been introduced, enabling LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. However, it remains unclear how sensitivity awareness relates to established notions of privacy, such as differential privacy (DP), thereby making it difficult to deploy meaningfully in real-world applications. In this work, we formalize the notion of sensitivity awareness and theoretically establish its connection to DP. Additionally, we develop a supervised fine-tuning recipe to make existing, four-bit quantized LLMs more sensitivity-aware. With a performance boost of up to 21.7%, the finetuned LLMs not only substantially improve over their baseline but also outperform other full-precision open-source and commercial models of similar size in achieving sensitivity awareness, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

However, existing methods suffer from the inefficiency of incremental context construction that requires step-by-step LLM interaction, and often stagnate in suboptimal regions due to surface-level optimization. In this paper, we characterize the Intent-Context Coupling phenomenon, revealing that LLM safety constraints are significantly relaxed when a malicious intent is coupled with a semantically congruent context pattern. Driven by this insight, we propose ICON, an automated multi-turn jailbreak framework that efficiently constructs an authoritative-style context via prior-guided semantic routing. Specifically, ICON first routes the malicious intent to a congruent context pattern (e.g., Scientific Research) and instantiates it into an attack prompt sequence. This sequence progressively builds the authoritative-style context and ultimately elicits prohibited content. In addition, ICON incorporates a Hierarchical Optimization Strategy that combines local prompt refinement with global context switching, preventing the attack from stagnating in ineffective contexts. Experimental results across eight SOTA LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of ICON, achieving a state-of-the-art average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 97.1\\%.

Such clients can interfere with the training process by sending misleading updates, which can negatively affect the performance and reliability of the global model. Many existing defense mechanisms rely on gradient inspection, complex similarity computations, or cryptographic operations, which introduce additional overhead and may become unstable under non-IID data distributions. In this paper, we propose the Federated Learning with Loss Trend Detection (FL-LTD), a lightweight and privacy-preserving defense framework that detects and mitigates malicious behavior by monitoring temporal loss dynamics rather than model gradients. The proposed approach identifies anomalous clients by detecting abnormal loss stagnation or abrupt loss fluctuations across communication rounds. To counter adaptive attackers, a short-term memory mechanism is incorporated to sustain mitigation for clients previously flagged as anomalous, while enabling trust recovery for stable participants. We evaluate FL-LTD on a non-IID federated MNIST setup under loss manipulation attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances robustness, achieving a final test accuracy of 0.84, compared to 0.41 for standard FedAvg under attack.

An Exact Realizer Identity shows that the minimal advice for any input-blind executor equals M(x) up to O(1), while a description plus selection upper bound refines it via computable feature maps, separating description cost K(y) from selection cost log i_y(x). In finite-ambiguity regimes M(x) approximately equals min_y K(y); in generic-fiber regimes the bound is tight. NAQ is quasi-invariant under bounded enumeration changes. An operational converse links NAQ to rate-distortion: communicating advice with error epsilon requires average length near the entropy of target features.

Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u4e13\u5c5e\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\uff0cLLM\u9002\u914d\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "DASH\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Profiled Library Retrieval\uff08PLR\uff09\u6765\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u91cd\u65b0\u9002\u914d\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDASH\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u73873\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06LLM\u9002\u914d\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e90%\u3002", "conclusion": "DASH\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Conventional pairwise error probability formulations under uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels fail to account for rank deficiency induced by sparse configurations. We revise these formulations to handle such cases in a unified manner. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form metric that effectively maximizes the noncoherent average mutual information (AMI) at a given signal-to-noise ratio. We focus on the fact that the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmann manifold provides a mathematically sparse property, and establish design criteria for sparse noncoherent codes based on our analyses. In numerical results, the proposed sparse noncoherent codes outperform conventional methods in terms of both symbol error rate and AMI, and asymptotically approach the performance of the optimal Grassmannian constellations in the high-signal-to-noise ratio regime.

Concurrent approaches have limitations: Bienstock et al. (ePrint 2025/1163) achieve arbitrary $T$ but require honest-majority and 37--136 rounds; Celi et al. (ePrint 2026/013) achieve dishonest-majority but are limited to $T \\leq 6$. Our technique addresses the barrier that Lagrange coefficients grow as $\u0398(q)$ for moderate $T$, making individual contributions too large for ML-DSA's rejection sampling.\n  Unlike ECDSA threshold schemes where pairwise masks suffice for correctness, ML-DSA requires solving three additional challenges absent in prior work: (1) rejection sampling on $\\|z\\|_\\infty$ must still pass after masking, (2) the $r_0$-check exposes $c s_2$ enabling key recovery if unprotected, and (3) the resulting Irwin-Hall nonce distribution must preserve EUF-CMA security. We solve all three.\n  We instantiate this technique in three deployment profiles with full security proofs. Profile P1 (TEE-assisted) achieves 3-round signing with a trusted coordinator, with EUF-CMA security under Module-SIS. Profile P2 (fully distributed) eliminates hardware trust via MPC in 8 rounds, achieving UC security against malicious adversaries corrupting up to $n-1$ parties.

These results establish SNGEM as a statistically nearly optimal deterministic sub-Nyquist parameter spectrum analysis", "AI": {"tldr": "SNGEM\u5728\u4e9a\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u9891\u7387/\u5e45\u503c/\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfOMP\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5OMP\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0DFT\u7f51\u683c\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6df7\u53e0\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u8bef\u5dee\uff1bSNGEM\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u6298\u53e0\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SNGEM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e24\u901a\u9053\u7b49\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\u5e45\u503c\u6bd4\u53c2\u6570R\u7684\u51c6\u786eCRB\u3002", "result": "Monte\u2011Carlo\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660eSNGEM\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u673a\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u572810\u201320\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4ecd\u9760\u8fd1CRB\uff0c\u800cOMP\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "SNGEM\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u4e9a\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u97f3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5168\u9891\u7387/\u5e45\u503c/\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u903c\u8fd1\u6240\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684CRB\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u51e0\u4e4e\u8fbe\u5230\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision.

With ever-growing onboard computing and storage resources, LEO satellites herald a new cloud paradigm: space cloud computing. While container or chestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) excel in terrestrial data centers, they are ill-suited to LEO satellite networks, featuring geographic dispersion and frequent handovers. Those features bring high latency and intermittent management, leading to control plane failure in container orchestration. To address this, we propose KubeSpace, a low-latency and stable control plane specifically designed for container orchestration on LEO satellites. KubeSpace combines two key innovations: a distributed ground-control-node architecture that binds each satellite to its nearest controller for uninterrupted management, and an orbit-aware placement with dynamic assignment strategy that further minimizes communication latency and handover frequency. Extensive experiments based on real satellite traces demonstrate that compared to existing solutions, KubeSpace reduces the average management latency of satellite nodes by 59% without any management interruption time.", "AI": {"tldr": "KubeSpace\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u5bb9\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u65e0\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5730\u9762\u5bb9\u5668\u5e73\u53f0\u5982Kubernetes\u5728LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u56e0\u5730\u7406\u5206\u6563\u4e0e\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u9762\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e3aLEO\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4ee5\u5730\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u9053\u75d5\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u9053\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cKubeSpace\u5e73\u5747\u7ba1\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u964d59%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u4e2d\u65ad\u7ba1\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "KubeSpace\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5730\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u5bb9\u5668\u7f16\u6392\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u9762\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u5207\u6362\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u4e2d\u65ad\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

Specifically, we model the locations of access points (APs) using a Poisson point process, human blockages as random cylinder processes, and wall blockages through a Boolean straight line process. A pointing error refers to beamforming gain and direction mismatch between the transmitter and receiver. We characterize it based on the inaccuracy of location estimate. We then analyze the impact of this pointing error on the received signal power and derive a tractable expression for the coverage probability, incorporating the multi-cluster fluctuating two-ray distribution to accurately model small-scale fading in THz communications. Aided by simulation results, we corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that the pointing error has a pronounced impact on the coverage probability. Specifically, we find that merely increasing the antenna array size is insufficient to improve the coverage probability and mitigate the detrimental impact of the pointing error, highlighting the necessity of advanced estimation techniques in THz communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8870\u843d\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e863D\u5ba4\u5185THz\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u5956\u53e3\u9635\u5217\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u53d1\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728THz\u9891\u6bb5\uff0c\u6ce2\u675f\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u5927\u9635\u5217\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5bf9\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u963b\u585e\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6cca\u677e\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21AP\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5706\u67f1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u8eab\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u5e03\u5c14\u76f4\u7ebf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u5899\u4f53\u963b\u585e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u523b\u753b\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7c07\u6ce2\u52a8\u53cc\u6ce2\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9THz\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8870\u843d\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f97\u51fa\uff1a\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4ec5\u589e\u5927\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u7ec4\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u8be5\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u5927\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5c3a\u5bf8\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53473D\u5ba4\u5185THz\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

A Cross-Industry Evaluation of Customer Guidance", "comment": null, "summary": "Phishing attacks through text, also known as smishing, are a prevalent type of social engineering tactic in which attackers impersonate brands to deceive victims into providing personal information and/or money. While smishing awareness and cyber education are a key method by which organizations communicate this awareness, the guidance itself varies widely. In this paper, we investigate the state of practice of how 149 well-known brands across 25 categories educate their customers about smishing and what smishing prevention and reporting advice they provide. After conducting a comprehensive content analysis of the brands, we identified significant gaps in the smishing-related information provided: only 46\\% of the 149 brands mentioned the definition of smishing, less than 1\\% had a video tutorial on smishing, and only 50\\% of brands provided instructions on how to report. Our study highlights variation in terminology, prevention advice, and reporting mechanisms across industries, with some brands recommending potentially ineffective strategies such as \"ignoring suspicious messages.\" These findings establish a baseline for understanding the current state of industry smishing awareness advice and provide specific areas where standardization improvements are needed.

Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation.

The sensor updates its content each time it captures a new measurement. The SCSP occasionally fetches the content from the sensor, caches the latest fetched version and broadcasts it on being requested by the users. The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work has been submitted to IEEE", "summary": "Time-domain ADCs are attractive for high-speed wireline receivers, as time resolution scales favorably with advanced CMOS technologies, enabling multi-GS/s single-channel sampling rates. However, conventional time-domain ADCs require explicit reset of voltage-to-time and time-domain signal paths between samples, introducing dead time that fundamentally limits resolution, speed, and energy efficiency. This paper introduces a dual-edge reset-free quantization concept for asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADCs, in which both rising and falling signal edges are exploited to enable reset-free quantization within a single conversion period. By eliminating explicit reset phases, the proposed approach expands the effective conversion window and relaxes the resolution-speed tradeoff at high sampling rates. An 8-bit dual-edge asynchronous pipelined SAR time-domain ADC is implemented in 22-nm FD-SOI, incorporating a linearity-compensated dual-edge voltage-to-time converter and a dual-edge time-to-digital converter with independently tunable rising- and falling-edge delays. The prototype occupies a core area of 0.0089 mm^2 and achieves continuous single-channel operation at 3.5 GS/s, with architectural scalability demonstrated through intermittent operation at 10.5 GS/s and higher. At 3.5 GS/s, the ADC achieves 21.6 dB SNDR and 32.2 dB SFDR. The measured performance is primarily limited by identifiable implementation-level factors rather than by architectural constraints, demonstrating the feasibility of dual-edge reset-free quantization for high-speed time-domain ADCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f18\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c8\u4f4d\u65f6\u57dfADC\u5b9e\u73b03.5 GS/s\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0cSNDR 21.6 dB\uff0cSFDR 32.2 dB\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u57dfADC\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u5468\u671f\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b7b\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u7f6e\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u65f6\u57dfADC\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f18\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5347\u3001\u964d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u8f6c\u6362\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ebf\u6027\u8865\u507f\u7684\u7535\u538b-\u65f6\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u548c\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u8282\u5347\u964d\u8fb9\u7f18\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u5b57\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u572822\u2011nm FD\u2011SOI\u5b9e\u73b08\u4f4d\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f02\u6b65\u7ba1\u7ebfSAR\u65f6\u57dfADC\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u9762\u79ef0.0089 mm\u00b2\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u5355\u901a\u90533.5 GS/s\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c10.5 GS/s\u30023.5 GS/s\u65f6\uff0cSNDR 21.6 dB\uff0cSFDR 32.2 dB\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8fb9\u7f18\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3001\u4f4e\u6b7b\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u65f6\u57dfADC\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting.

Under such asynchronous conditions, interharmonics lose orthogonality with the fundamental and harmonic components, giving rise to additional power components. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a linearization algorithm based on DFT spectrum analysis for precise power measurement in systems containing interharmonics. The proposed approach constructs a system of linear equations from the DFT spectrum and solves it through efficient matrix operations, enabling accurate extraction of interharmonic components near the fundamental and harmonic frequencies (with a frequency interval $\\geq$1 Hz). This allows for precise measurement of power across the fundamental, harmonic, interharmonic, and cross-power bands, as well as total power. Test results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately computes various power components under diverse conditions--including varying interharmonic/fundamental/harmonic intervals, fundamental frequency deviations, and noise. Compared to existing methods such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), Windowed interpolation FFT, and Matrix pencil-Singular value decomposition, the proposed technique reduces estimation error by several times to multiple folds and exhibits improved robustness, while maintaining a computational time of only 7 ms for processing 10-power-line-cycle (200 ms) data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528DFT\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u4e92\u8c03\u6ce2\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u529f\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e92\u8c03\u6ce2\u5728\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u529f\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u57fa\u9891\u6f02\u79fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u4e92\u8c03\u6ce2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DFT\u9891\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u8fd0\u7b97\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u57fa\u9891\u3001\u8c10\u6ce2\u53ca\u5176\u9644\u8fd1\u4e92\u8c03\u6ce2\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e92\u8c03\u6ce2/\u57fa\u9891/\u8c10\u6ce2\u95f4\u9694\u3001\u57fa\u9891\u6f02\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83FFT\u3001\u7a97\u53e3\u63d2\u503cFFT\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u652f\u70b9-\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u500d\uff0c\u5728200\u202fms\u91c7\u6837\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u4ec5\u97007\u202fms\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eDFT\u8c31\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u542b\u4e92\u8c03\u6ce2\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u529f\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u57fa\u9891\u504f\u79fb\u7b49\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8fd0\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

Existing protection methods either modify the model to embed watermarks, which impairs performance, or extract model fingerprints by manipulating the denoising process, rendering them incompatible with black-box APIs. In this paper, we propose TrajPrint, a completely lossless and training-free framework that verifies model copyright by extracting unique manifold fingerprints formed during deterministic generation. Specifically, we first utilize a watermarked image as an anchor and exactly trace the path back to its trajectory origin, effectively locking the model fingerprint mapped by this path. Subsequently, we implement a joint optimization strategy that employs dual-end anchoring to synthesize a specific fingerprint noise, which strictly adheres to the target manifold for robust watermark recovery. As input, it enables the protected target model to recover the watermarked image, while failing on non-target models.

In this paper, we present a unified, delay-aware framework that models this coupling explicitly and quantifies a delay-dependent information gain, motivating an information-per-joule scheduling objective beyond age of information proxies (AoI). To this end, we first introduce an efficient posterior-fusion update that incorporates delayed measurements without state augmentation, providing a consistent approximation to optimal delayed Kalman updates, and then derive tractable stability conditions ensuring that bounded estimation error is achievable under stochastic, delayed scheduling. This conditions highlight the need for unstable modes to be observable across sensors. Building on this foundation, we cast scheduling as a Markov decision process and develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheduler that learns directly from interaction, requires no prior delay model, and explicitly trades off estimation accuracy, freshness, sensor heterogeneity, and transmission energy through normalized rewards. In simulations with heterogeneous sensors, realistic link-energy models, and random delays, the proposed method learns stably and consistently achieves lower estimation error at comparable energy than random scheduling and strong RL baselines (DQN, A2C), while remaining robust to variations in measurement availability and process/measurement noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662.

While sparse subarray architectures can reduce cost, they introduce severe estimation ambiguity from grating lobes. To address both issues, we propose SHARE (Sparse Hierarchical Angle-Range Estimation), a novel two-stage sparse recovery algorithm. SHARE operates in two stages. It first performs coarse, unambiguous angle estimation using individual subarrays to resolve the grating lobe ambiguity. It then leverages the full sparse aperture to perform a localized joint angle-range search. This hierarchical approach avoids an exhaustive and computationally intensive two-dimensional grid search while preserving the high resolution of the large aperture. Simulation results show that SHARE significantly outperforms conventional one-shot sparse recovery methods, such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), in both localization accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we show that SHARE's overall localization accuracy is comparable to or even surpasses that of the fully-digital 2D-MUSIC algorithm, despite MUSIC having access to the complete, uncompressed data from every antenna element. SHARE therefore provides a practical path for high-resolution near-field ISAC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHARE\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u6d88\u9664\u955c\u50cf\u74e3\u6b67\u4e49\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u5b54\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u65e2\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u662f\u8fd1\u573aISAC\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u9635\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u955c\u50cf\u74e3\u5206\u8fa8\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5404\u5b50\u9635\u7684\u7c97\u89d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d88\u9664\u955c\u50cf\u74e3\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u7a00\u758f\u5b54\u5f84\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u89d2-\u8ddd\u79bb\u8054\u5408\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5168\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0cSHARE\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00Shot\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5OMP\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e43\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u76842D-MUSIC\u3002", "conclusion": "SHARE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u6570\u5b57MUSIC\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8fd1\u573aISAC\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8d39\u7528\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels.

To address this issue, channel extrapolation techniques have been proposed to acquire complete CSI from a limited number of known CSIs. To improve extrapolation accuracy, environmental information, such as visual images or radar data, has been utilized, which poses challenges including additional hardware, privacy and multi-modal alignment concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a novel channel extrapolation framework by leveraging environment-related multi-path characteristics induced directly from CSI without integrating additional modalities. Specifically, we propose utilizing the multi-path characteristics in the form of power-delay profile (PDP), which is acquired using a CSI-to-PDP module. CSI-to-PDP module is trained in an AE-based framework by reconstructing the PDPs and constraining the latent low-dimensional features to represent the CSI. We further extract the total power & power-weighted delay of all the identified paths in PDP as the multi-path information. Building on this, we proposed a MAE architecture trained in a self-supervised manner to perform channel extrapolation. Unlike standard MAE approaches, our method employs separate encoders to extract features from the masked CSI and the multi-path information, which are then fused by a cross-attention module. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this framework improves extrapolation performance dramatically, with a minor increase in inference time (around 0.1 ms). Furthermore, our model shows strong generalization capabilities, particularly when only a small portion of the CSI is known, outperforming existing benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents a personalized phishing detection framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For each message, the system constructs user-specific context by retrieving a compact set of the user's historical legitimate emails and enriching it with real-time domain and URL reputation from a cyber-threat intelligence platform, then conditions the LLM's decision on this evidence. We evaluate four open-source LLMs (Llama4-Scout, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral-Saba, and Gemma2) on an email dataset collected from public and institutional sources. Results show high performance; for example, Llama4-Scout attains an F1-score of 0.9703 and achieves a 66.7% reduction in FPs with RAG.

We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach.

However, the computational overhead remains a major challenge. While prior work has improved efficiency, most approaches build on models originally designed for plaintext inference. Such models incur architectural inefficiencies when adapted to HE. We argue that substantial gains require networks tailored to HE rather than retrofitting plaintext architectures. Our design has two components: the building block and the overall architecture. First, StriaBlock targets the most expensive HE operation, rotation. It integrates ExRot-Free Convolution and a novel Cross Kernel, eliminating external rotations and requiring only 19% of the internal rotations used by plaintext models. Second, our architectural principles include (i) the Focused Constraint Principle, which limits cost-sensitive factors while preserving flexibility elsewhere, and (ii) the Channel Packing-Aware Scaling Principle, which adapts bottleneck ratios to ciphertext channel capacity that varies with depth. Together, these strategies control both local and end-to-end HE cost, enabling a balanced HE-tailored network. We evaluate the resulting StriaNet across datasets of varying scales, including ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-10. At comparable accuracy, StriaNet achieves speedups of 9.78x, 6.01x, and 9.24x on ImageNet, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-10, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

StarSD decouples drafting and verification, enabling effective sharing of draft computation, and preventing distributed accelerators from remaining idle under bursty workloads. We provide a system-level analysis that characterizes when and why a single draft model can remain fully utilized by multiple verifiers, yielding predictable latency and utilization gains. Extensive experiments in real-world distributed inference settings demonstrate that StarSD simplifies deployment and supports flexible resource allocation across heterogeneous accelerators, while maintaining output quality.

Our contribution is motivated by two observations. First, privacy mechanisms developed for one-time data release cannot straightforwardly be extended to sequential releases. Second, practical databases are likely to be useful to multiple distinct parties. Furthermore, we can not rule out the possibility of data sharing between parties. With utility in mind, we formulate a privacy-utility trade-off problem to adaptively tackle sequential data requests made by different, potentially colluding entities. We consider both expected distortion and mutual information as measures to quantify utility, and use mutual information to measure privacy. We assume an attack model whereby illicit data sharing, which we call collusion, can occur between data receivers. We develop an adaptive algorithm for data releases that makes use of a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. We show that the resulting data releases are optimal when expected distortion quantifies utility, and locally optimal when mutual information quantifies utility.

The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model.

Of particular practical interest are checking confidentiality and integrity of secrets, by checking that there is no information flow between the secrets and observable outputs. A standard method for checking information flow is to translate the corresponding non-interference hyperproperty into a safety property on a self-composition of the design, which has two copies of the design composed together. Although prior efforts have aimed to reduce the size of the self-composed design, there are no state-of-the-art model checkers that exploit their special structure for hardware security verification. In this paper, we propose SecIC3, a hardware model checking algorithm based on IC3 that is customized to exploit this self-composition structure. SecIC3 utilizes this structure in two complementary techniques: symmetric state exploration and adding equivalence predicates. We implement SecIC3 on top of two open-source IC3 implementations and evaluate it on a non-interference checking benchmark consisting of 10 designs. The experiment results show that SecIC3 significantly reduces the time for finding security proofs, with up to 49.3x proof speedup compared to baseline implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SecIC3\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41/\u975e\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5b9a\u5236IC3\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u8c13\u8bcd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8bc1\u660e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb 49.3 \u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u786c\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u68c0\u67e5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7ec4\u5408\u5c06\u975e\u5e72\u6270\u5c5e\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u7ec4\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f53\u79ef\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u8017\u65f6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u5176\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6 IC3 \u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5b9a\u5236\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e24\u4efd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u72b6\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\uff1b2\uff09\u6dfb\u52a0 equivalence predicates \u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u5957\u5f00\u6e90 IC3\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u81f3 SecIC3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b10\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u975e\u5e72\u6270\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSecIC3 \u5c06\u8bc1\u660e\u8017\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b0 49.3 \u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e24\u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90 IC3 \u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "SecIC3 \u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff08Symmetric State Exploration \u548c Equivalence Predicates\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41/\u975e\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u8fbe 49.3 \u500d\u3002"}}

For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201cp-MAP\u201d\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u9a6c\u53f0\u5cad\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u9a6c\u53f0\u5cad\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u201d\u65b0\u7c7b\uff0c\u6784\u9020p-MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3cMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u503c\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff08BF\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e73\u5747BF\uff08MBF\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed9\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65f6\u53ef\u9006CTMC\uff0cMAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u5316\u7b80\u4e3ap-MAP\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u5355\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u53d8\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u5177\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u53c8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9a6c\u53f0\u5cad\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u5f0f\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, as classifiers, LLM routers are vulnerable to novel adversarial attacks in the form of LLM rerouting, where adversaries prepend specially crafted triggers to user queries to manipulate routing decisions. Such attacks can lead to increased computational cost, degraded response quality, and even bypass safety guardrails, yet their security implications remain largely underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by systematizing LLM rerouting threats based on the adversary's objectives (i.e., cost escalation, quality hijacking, and safety bypass) and knowledge. Based on the threat taxonomy, we conduct a measurement study of real-world LLM routing systems against existing LLM rerouting attacks. The results reveal that existing routing systems are vulnerable to rerouting attacks, especially in the cost escalation scenario. We then characterize existing rerouting attacks using interpretability techniques, revealing that they exploit router decision boundaries through confounder gadgets that prepend queries to force misrouting. To mitigate these risks, we introduce RerouteGuard, a flexible and scalable guardrail framework for LLM rerouting. RerouteGuard filters adversarial rerouting prompts via dynamic embedding-based detection and adaptive thresholding. Extensive evaluations in three attack settings and four benchmarks demonstrate that RerouteGuard achieves over 99% detection accuracy against state-of-the-art rerouting attacks, while maintaining negligible impact on legitimate queries.

We show that existing encoder-based attacks can substantially overestimate the robustness of compressed LVLMs, due to an optimization-inference mismatch: perturbations are optimized on the full-token representation, while inference is performed through a token-compression bottleneck. To address this gap, we propose the Compression-AliGnEd attack (CAGE), which aligns perturbation optimization with compression inference without assuming access to the deployed compression mechanism or its token budget. CAGE combines (i) expected feature disruption, which concentrates distortion on tokens likely to survive across plausible budgets, and (ii) rank distortion alignment, which actively aligns token distortions with rank scores to promote the retention of highly distorted evidence. Across diverse representative plug-and-play compression mechanisms and datasets, our results show that CAGE consistently achieves lower robust accuracy than the baseline. This work highlights that robustness assessments ignoring compression can be overly optimistic, calling for compression-aware security evaluation and defenses for efficient LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u5ffd\u7565\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u7684CAGE\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u671f\u671b\u7279\u5f81\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6392\u540d\u5931\u771f\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aCAGE\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fLVLM\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAGE\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u671f\u671b\u7279\u5f81\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6392\u540d\u5931\u771f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u83b7\u53d6\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u6216\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "CAGE\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ffd\u89c6\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, its robustness against realistic adversarial threats remains largely unexplored. We introduce ICL-Evader, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that operates under a highly practical zero-query threat model, requiring no access to model parameters, gradients, or query-based feedback during attack generation. We design three novel attacks, Fake Claim, Template, and Needle-in-a-Haystack, that exploit inherent limitations of LLMs in processing in-context prompts. Evaluated across sentiment analysis, toxicity, and illicit promotion tasks, our attacks significantly degrade classifier performance (e.g., achieving up to 95.3% attack success rate), drastically outperforming traditional NLP attacks which prove ineffective under the same constraints. To counter these vulnerabilities, we systematically investigate defense strategies and identify a joint defense recipe that effectively mitigates all attacks with minimal utility loss (<5% accuracy degradation). Finally, we translate our defensive insights into an automated tool that proactively fortifies standard ICL prompts against adversarial evasion. This work provides a comprehensive security assessment of ICL, revealing critical vulnerabilities and offering practical solutions for building more robust systems.

Existing convergence analyses of diffusion models typically scale at least linearly with the ambient dimension, and sharper rates often depend on intrinsic-dimension assumptions or other geometric restrictions on the target distribution. We develop an alternative, information-theoretic approach to dimension-free convergence that avoids any geometric assumptions. Under mild assumptions on the target distribution, we bound KL divergence between the target and generated distributions by $O(H^2/K)$ (up to endpoint factors), where $H$ is the Shannon entropy and $K$ is the number of sampling steps.

In particular, fine-tuned models are highly vulnerable, as they are often fine-tuned on small and private datasets. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are used to assess privacy risks by determining whether a specific sample was part of a model's training data. Existing MIAs against diffusion models either assume obtaining the intermediate results or require auxiliary datasets for training the shadow model. In this work, we utilized a critical yet overlooked vulnerability: the widely used noise schedules fail to fully eliminate semantic information in the images, resulting in residual semantic signals even at the maximum noise step. We empirically demonstrate that the fine-tuned diffusion model captures hidden correlations between the residual semantics in initial noise and the original images. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective membership inference attack, which injects semantic information into the initial noise and infers membership by analyzing the model's generation result.

The analysis demonstrates that the EUE is a piecewise linear function and the storage MRI retains a non-negative property across various system scenarios. We further explore the influence of qualified capacity (QC), storage dispatch rules, and other key factors on storage accreditation, providing practical insights for system operators. Additionally, comparisons of storage capacity accreditation under different reliability criteria offer valuable guidance for policymakers in setting future standards. Numerical results from a modified California system validate our findings and highlight several important phenomena associated with the MRI-based accreditation scheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdb\u50a8\u80fd\u5bb9\u91cf\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MRI\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5bb9\u91cf\u5e02\u573a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u50a8\u80fd\u5bb9\u91cf\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u6784\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u50a8\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e58\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97MRI\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u66b4\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMRI\u662f\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\uff0cQC\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u88ab\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u6bd4\u8f83\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7MRI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u50a8\u80fd\u5bb9\u91cf\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a plug-and-play precoder (PaPP), a DL framework with a backbone that can be trained for either fully digital (FDP) or hybrid beamforming (HBF) precoding and reused across sites, transmit-power levels, and with varying amounts of channel estimation error, avoiding the need to train a new model from scratch at each deployment. PaPP combines a high-capacity teacher and a compact student with a self-supervised loss that balances teacher imitation and normalized sum-rate, trained using meta-learning domain-generalization and transmit-power-aware input normalization. Numerical results on ray-tracing data from three unseen sites show that the PaPP FDP and HBF models both outperform conventional and deep learning baselines, after fine-tuning with a small set of local unlabeled samples.

Traditionally, fingerprinting operates under a closed-world assumption, where models of all implementations are assumed to be available. However, this assumption is unrealistic in practice. When this assumption does not hold, fingerprinting results in numerous misclassifications without indicating that a model for an implementation is missing. Therefore, we introduce an open-world variant of the fingerprinting problem, where not all models are known in advance. We propose an incremental fingerprinting approach to solve the problem by combining active automata learning with closed-world fingerprinting. Our approach quickly determines whether the implementation under consideration matches an available model using fingerprinting and conformance checking. If no match is found, it learns a new model by exploiting the structure of available models. We prove the correctness of our approach and improvements in asymptotic complexity compared to naive baselines. Moreover, experimental results on a variety of protocols demonstrate a significant reduction in misclassifications and interactions with these black-boxes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper develops linear optimization models for multi-interval LAED and RP-based co-optimization, and proves that an enhanced RP formulation can match LAED's dispatch feasible region at a single time step when additional intertemporal deliverability constraints are enforced. We then show that this equivalence does not generally persist under rolling-window operation because LAED and RP formulations optimize different intertemporal objectives, leading to divergent end-of-window states. Using different test systems under stressed ramping conditions and multiple load levels, we show LAED achieves similar or lower load shedding than RP implementations with the same look-ahead horizon, with the most pronounced differences under high-load, ramp-limited conditions. The study highlights the limitations of current ramp product implementations and suggests enhancements, such as introducing more mid-duration RPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Deep learning-based approaches are increasingly popular for their advantages: automatically learning complex patterns and extracting semantic features from HTTP requests to achieve superior detection performance. However, existing methods are less effective in embedding irregular HTTP requests, even failing to model unordered parameters and achieve attack traceability. In this paper, we propose an effective web attack detection model, named WADBERT. It achieves high detection accuracy while enabling the precise identification of malicious parameters. To this end, we first employ Hybrid Granularity Embedding (HGE) to generate fine-grained embeddings for URL and payload parameters. Then, URLBERT and SecBERT are respectively utilized to extract their semantic features. Further, parameter-level features (extracted by SecBERT) are fused through a multi-head attention mechanism, resulting in a comprehensive payload feature. Finally, by feeding the concatenated URL and payload features into a linear classifier, a final detection result is obtained.

However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead.

In this paper we approximate such a theory and propose a semi-decision procedure to determine whether a protocol, which may use all operations in such groups, satisfies user-defined properties. We implement this approach by extending the Tamarin prover to support the full Diffie-Hellman theory, including group element multiplication and hence addition of exponents. This is the first time a state-of-the-art tool can model and reason about such protocols. We illustrate our approach's effectiveness with different case studies: ElGamal encryption and MQV.

Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDM\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u566a\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9075\u5b88\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u62df\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ec5\u5728\u540e\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConditional Denoising Model\uff08CDM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6062\u590d\u5e72\u51c0\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u628a\u566a\u58f0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCDM\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5faa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8865\u5168\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5404\u81ea\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee515\u5206\u949f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5728\u517c\u5bb9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u7b26\u5408\u5df2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP is inversely proportional to $\u03b4$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on R\u00e9nyi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $\u03b5$, where R\u00e9nyi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation.

The core idea is to shape the model's decision function such that it yields different predictions for the same input when executed on different hardware. This effect is achieved by locally moving the decision boundary close to a target input and then refining numerical deviations to flip the prediction on selected hardware.

Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices.

Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACO\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6027\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763NCO\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ffd\u6c42\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6cdb\u5316\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5931\u53bb\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5df2\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u5fc3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6TACO\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6218\u7565\u9884\u70ed\uff08warm\u2011starting\uff09\u65b9\u5f0f\u90e8\u5206\u653e\u5bbd\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u8bf1\u5bfc\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6709\u673a\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u9876\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\uff08Minimum Vertex Cover\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5927\u56e2\uff08Maximum Clique\uff09\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cTACO\u5728\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u529b\u4e0e\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u9644\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002"}}

We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale.

To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.\n  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths.

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations.

We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound.

However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable.

For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cME-POIs \u6355\u6349 POI \u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528\u5730\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4ec5\u9760\u6587\u672c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u7f3a\u5931\u7684 POI \u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ME-POIs \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u7684 POI \u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u628a\u65f6\u5e8f\u5316\u8bbf\u5ba2\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684 POI \u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u90bb\u8fd1\u9ad8\u9891\u8bbf\u95ee POI \u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cME-POIs \u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6216\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684 ME-POIs \u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fd8\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e POI \u529f\u80fd\u662f\u83b7\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u805a\u7126 POI \u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528\u5730\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality.

We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously.

Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions.

Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDUET\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u5f0fLLM\u53bb\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u6559\u5e08\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u786e\u53bb\u5b66\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u4efbAI\u8981\u6c42\u7684LLM\u53bb\u5b66\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u4f18\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u77ed\u677f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6559\u5e08\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u826f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53bb\u5b66\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0cDUET\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u500d\u5230\u6570\u5341\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DUET\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684LLM\u53bb\u5b66\uff08unlearning\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u4e0e\u539f\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u9886\u5148\u3002"}}

While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets.

We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer. By coupling physics-aligned representations with EVT-calibrated decision rules, PG-TMT delivers calibrated, interpretable, and deployment-ready early warnings for reliability-centric prognostics and health management.", "AI": {"tldr": "PG\u2011TMT\uff1a\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684 Tiny\u2011Mamba Transformer \u7ed3\u5408 EVT \u9608\u503c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u57df\u3001\u9ad8\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u901f\u5ea6/\u8d1f\u8377/\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8de8\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u8bef\u62a5\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684 Tiny\u2011Mamba Transformer\uff0c\u4e09\u652f\u8def\u914d\u7f6e\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u3001Tiny\u2011Mamba \u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u672c\u5730 Transformer\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u65f6\u9891\u6620\u5c04\u5efa\u7acb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8f74\u627f\u6545\u969c\u9891\u5e26\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u53cc\u9608\u6301\u4e45\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728 CWRU\u3001Paderborn\u3001XJTU\u2011SY \u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bd5\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPG\u2011TMT \u5728\u5339\u914d\u8bef\u62a5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u2011\u53ec\u56deAUC\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8eROC AUC\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "PG\u2011TMT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u673a\u68b0\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset. InfoUtil incorporates two key components: (1) game-theoretic informativeness maximization using Shapley Value attribution to extract key information from samples, and (2) principled utility maximization by selecting globally influential samples based on Gradient Norm.

Specifically, to preserve domain-invariant knowledge, we first extract domain causal-invariant features from the spatial domain of the graph using causal interventions. Then, to fully capture the structural and feature information of the original graph, we perform enhanced condensation operations. Finally, through spectral-domain enhanced contrastive learning, we inject the causal-invariant features into the condensed graph, ensuring that the compressed graph retains the causal information of the original graph. Experimental results on five public datasets and our novel \\textbf{FinReport} dataset demonstrate that TGCC achieves up to a 13.41\\% improvement in cross-task and cross-domain complex scenarios compared to existing methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario.", "AI": {"tldr": "TGCC\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e0e\u8c31\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1/\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff1b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTGCC\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u64cd\u4f5c\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8c31\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u56fe\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u56fe\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u81ea\u7814FinReport\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTGCC\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe13.41%\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u57286\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d5\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TGCC\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8c31\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8de8\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice. We develop an efficient learning algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with existing UDA methods.

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor.

We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off.

However, standard reward models are susceptible to spurious features that are not causally related to human labels. This can lead to reward hacking, where high predicted reward does not translate into better behavior. In this work, we address this problem from a causal perspective by proposing a factored representation learning framework that decomposes the model's contextual embedding into (1) causal factors that are sufficient for reward prediction and (2) non-causal factors that capture reward-irrelevant attributes such as length or sycophantic bias. The reward head is then constrained to depend only on the causal component.

We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system.

Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments.\n  To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies.

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training.

However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f73\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ef4\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7528k-Diff\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60k\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7406\u8bba\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u5c11\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1k-Diff\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18k\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "k-Diff\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636ex\u5728\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684k\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u76ee\u6807\uff1bk-Diff\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce ConceptMoE, which dynamically merges semantically similar tokens into concept representations, performing implicit token-level compute allocation. A learnable chunk module identifies optimal boundaries by measuring inter-token similarity, compressing sequences by a target ratio $R$ before they enter the compute-intensive concept model. Crucially, the MoE architecture enables controlled evaluation: we reallocate saved computation to match baseline activated FLOPs (excluding attention map computation) and total parameters, isolating genuine architectural benefits. Under these conditions, ConceptMoE consistently outperforms standard MoE across language and vision-language tasks, achieving +0.9 points on language pretraining, +2.3 points on long context understanding, and +0.6 points on multimodal benchmarks. When converting pretrained MoE during continual training with layer looping, gains reach +5.5 points, demonstrating practical applicability. Beyond performance, ConceptMoE reduces attention computation by up to $R^2\\times$ and KV cache by $R\\times$. At $R=2$, empirical measurements show prefill speedups reaching 175\\% and decoding speedups up to 117\\% on long sequences.

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAGE\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5217\u8868\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u8bcd\u5178\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5341\u5b57\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982OneRec\u867d\u7136\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u5355\u72ec\u8bcd\u5178\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u7528\u539f\u751fLLM\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u53e6\u5916\uff0cOneRec\u7684GBPO\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u6291\u5236\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u584c\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faSAGE\uff08Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5217\u8868\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002SAGE\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u52bf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u8bcd\u7ea7\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u574d\u584c\uff1b(2) \u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9879\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u56e0\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u6253\u7834\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u623f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u9501\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301GBPO\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u590d\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bcd\u5178\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u9759\u6001\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \\method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality.

This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al.

Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency.

Yet, existing decoding and uncertainty estimation methods operate only in language space and largely disregard structural information. We address this by modeling LLM outputs directly in a task-dependent latent structure. By equipping this structure with a dissimilarity measure, we can compute Bayes-optimal responses. These are not selected from sampled generations but are newly synthesized by combining individual responses in the latent space.

At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent.

On the other hand, using local reward benefits from faster learning due to the separation of agents' contributions, but can be suboptimal as agents myopically optimize their own reward while disregarding the global optimality. In this work, we propose a method that combines the merits of both approaches. By using a graph of interaction between agents, our method discerns the individual agent contribution in a more fine-grained manner than a global reward, while alleviating the cooperation problem with agents' local reward. We also introduce a practical approach for approximating such a graph.

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

However, existing disentanglement methods rely on a standard mean-field approximation with a diagonal posterior covariance, which decorrelates all latent dimensions. Additionally, these methods often assume isotropic Gaussian priors for exogenous noise, failing to capture the complex, non-Gaussian statistical properties prevalent in real-world causal factors. Therefore, we propose FlexCausal, a novel CDRL framework based on a block-diagonal covariance VAE. FlexCausal utilizes a Factorized Flow-based Prior to realistically model the complex densities of exogenous noise, effectively decoupling the learning of causal mechanisms from distributional statistics. By integrating supervised alignment objectives with counterfactual consistency constraints, our framework ensures a precise structural correspondence between the learned latent subspaces and the ground-truth causal relations.

We further reveal that stitching is inherently asymmetric, demonstrating that robust functional comparison necessitates a bidirectional analysis rather than a unidirectional mapping. Second, concerning representational similarity, we prove that reconstruction-based metrics and standard tools (e.g., CKA, RSA) act as estimators of usable information under specific constraints. Crucially, we show that similarity is relative to the capacity of the predictive family: representations that appear distinct to a rigid observer may be identical to a more expressive one.

A natural alternative is to shape capabilities during pretraining itself. On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain.

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM. In addition, to make SATR practical at scale, we introduce a bitset implementation for binary spiking and binary weights, substantially reducing wall-clock training time and enabling fast RSNN policy search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although existing methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often lack a foundational theoretical explanation. We establish a gradient-based theoretical framework to explain catastrophic forgetting. We first prove that strongly negative gradient similarity is a fundamental cause of forgetting. We then use gradient similarity to identify two types of neurons: conflicting neurons that induce forgetting and account for 50%-75% of neurons, and collaborative neurons that mitigate forgetting and account for 25%-50%. Based on this analysis, we propose a knowledge injection method, Collaborative Neural Learning (CNL). By freezing conflicting neurons and updating only collaborative neurons, CNL theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting under an infinitesimal learning rate eta and an exactly known mastered set. Experiments on five LLMs, four datasets, and four optimizers show that CNL achieves zero forgetting in in-set settings and reduces forgetting by 59.1%-81.7% in out-of-set settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively.

This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector.\n  To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing.

In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks.

Nathan Kutz"], "title": "SENDAI: A Hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Bridging the gap between data-rich training regimes and observation-sparse deployment conditions remains a central challenge in spatiotemporal field reconstruction, particularly when target domains exhibit distributional shifts, heterogeneous structure, and multi-scale dynamics absent from available training data. We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "SENDAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5dee\u5f02\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5168\u7403\u591a\u5730\u70b9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5148\u9a8c\u53c8\u80fd\u6821\u6b63\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u884d\u751f\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4ece\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8bef\u5dee\u6539\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728MODIS\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSENDAI\u5728\u516d\u5927\u5168\u7403\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u5b63\u8282\u5468\u671f\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u53ca\u9ad8\u9891\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u5927SSIM\u63d0\u5347185%\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534736%\uff1b\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u5b50\u5b63\u8282\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "SENDAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u77eb\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edfRL\u7684\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ec8\u70b9\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728GRPO\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u574d\u584c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591aRL\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ec8\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c11\u6570\u51e0\u79cd\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6e90\u81ea\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u672c\u8eab\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u671f\u671b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e58\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u5728Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0IPS-GRPO\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cIPS-GRPO\u5728\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ec8\u70b9\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u4f18\u5316\u7684RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\uff08Inverse Probability Scaling\uff09\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u574d\u584c\uff1b\u5728GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684IPS-GRPO\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.\n  We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.\n  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \\textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement.

Despite empirical successes, a unified theory for its effectiveness under heterogeneous finetuning hyperparameters (e.g., varying learning rates, batch sizes) remains missing. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter transparency in open-source fine-tuned models makes it difficult to predict merged-model performance, leaving practitioners without guidance on how to fine-tune merge-friendly experts. To address those two challenges, we employ $L_2$-Stability theory under heterogeneous hyperparameter environments to analyze the generalization of the merged model $\\boldsymbol{x}_{avg}$. This pioneering analysis yields two key contributions: (i) \\textit{A unified theoretical framework} is provided to explain existing merging algorithms, revealing how they optimize specific terms in our bound, thus offering a strong theoretical foundation for empirical observations. (ii) \\textit{Actionable recommendations} are proposed for practitioners to strategically fine-tune expert models, enabling the construction of merge-friendly models within the pretraining-to-finetuning pipeline.

Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute.

Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept.

Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wishart\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u62a4\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u52a0\u566a; \u52a0\u566a\u540e\u8fd8\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u9690\u79c1\uff0cLoRA\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u66f4\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1Wishart\u968f\u673a\u6027\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff08LoRA\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u968f\u673a\u6620\u5c04 $S\\mapsto M f(S)$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d $M\\sim W_d(1/r I_d,r)$\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u5f62\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1DP\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u5f97\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1DP\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u51fa\u73b0\u9ad8AUC\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u540e\uff0c\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5927/\u5c0f\u79e9\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\u6548\u679c\uff1bLoRA\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Wishart\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3DP\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u67e5\u8be2\u5219\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u540e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\uff1bLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u975e\u5929\u7136\u79c1\u6709\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

We introduce an interpretability-driven framework for amortized spectral discovery from pre-trained PFNs with decoupled attention. We perform a mechanistic analysis on a trained PFN that identifies attention latent output as the key intermediary, linking observed function data to spectral structure. Building on this insight, we propose decoder architectures that map PFN latents to explicit spectral density estimates and corresponding stationary kernels via Bochner's theorem. We study this pipeline in both single-realization and multi-realization regimes, contextualizing theoretical limits on spectral identifiability and proving consistency when multiple function samples are available. Empirically, the proposed decoders recover complex multi-peak spectral mixtures and produce explicit kernels that support Gaussian process regression with accuracy comparable to PFNs and optimization-based baselines, while requiring only a single forward pass. This yields orders-of-magnitude reductions in inference time compared to optimization-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ecePFN\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6838\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3PFN\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPFN\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6838\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c31\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u4ecePFN\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c2\u6d4b\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u6784\u9020\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c06PFN\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u5e03\u6717\u56de\u63a8\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3astationary\u6838\uff1b\u5728\u5355/\u591a\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8c31\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5cf0\u8c31\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6838\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0ePFN\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u767e\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PFNs\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PFN\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6838\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0b\u6e38\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u5411\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

As a result, a single MVM requires many compute cycles, and weights cannot be efficiently stored in a single crossbar cell. To address this problem, we propose a mixed-precision training and compilation framework for CIM architectures. The biggest challenge is the massive search space, that makes it difficult to find good quantization parameters. This is why we introduce a reinforcement learning-based strategy to find suitable quantization configurations that balance latency and accuracy.

We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \\textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$.

While deep learning models perform well in the early prediction of sepsis, they often lack interpretability and ignore latent patient sub-phenotypes. In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to \"flatten\" the data.

In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads.

Unlike existing approaches that map queries directly to adapters, LORAUTER routes queries via task embeddings derived from small validation sets and does not require adapter training data. By operating at the task level, LORAUTER achieves efficient routing that scales with the number of tasks rather than the number of adapters. Experiments across multiple tasks show that LORAUTER consistently outperforms baseline routing approaches, matching Oracle performance (101.2%) when task-aligned adapters exist and achieving state-of-the-art results on unseen tasks (+5.2 points). We further demonstrate the robustness of LORAUTER to very large, noisy adapter pools by scaling it to over 1500 adapters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.\n  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.\n  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention.

However, ensuring the desired level of accuracy for a certain task at minimal computational cost, e.g. as few black-box samples as possible, remains a challenges. Active learning strategies are used for scalar quantities to overcome this challenges and different so-called infill criteria exists and are commonly employed in several scenarios. Even though needed in various field an extension of active learning strategies towards field predictions is still lacking or limited to very specific scenarios and/or model types. In this paper we propose an active learning strategy for machine learning models that are capable if predicting field which is agnostic to the model architecture itself. For doing so, we combine a well-established Gaussian process model for a scalar reference value and simultaneously aim at reducing the epistemic model error and the difference between scalar and field predictions.

Experimental results show similar or improved uncertainty estimation and calibration compared to existing LLA approximations.

Constrained meta RL provides a promising framework for integrating safety into meta RL. An open question in constrained meta RL is how to ensure the safety of the policy on the real-world test task, while reducing the sample complexity and thus, enabling faster learning of optimal policies.

Existing mitigation methods often rely on unavailable group labels or computationally expensive gradient-based adversarial optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Visual Disentangled Diffusion Autoencoders (DiDAE), a novel framework integrating frozen foundation models with disentangled dictionary learning for efficient, gradient-free counterfactual generation directly for the foundation model. DiDAE first edits foundation model embeddings in interpretable disentangled directions of the disentangled dictionary and then decodes them via a diffusion autoencoder. This allows the generation of multiple diverse, disentangled counterfactuals for each factual, much faster than existing baselines, which generate single entangled counterfactuals.

Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoHETS\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5916\u751f\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u5377\u79ef\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MSE\u4e0b\u964d12%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u5448\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u8d8b\u52bf\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5468\u671f\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758fMixture-of-Experts\u4ee5MLP\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u6837\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u597d\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Encoder-only Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u7a00\u758fMoHE\u5c42\uff1b\u5728MoHE\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u6574\u4f53\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57fa\u4e13\u5bb6\u6355\u6349\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef\u8865\u4e01\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u5934\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u9879\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u8ddd\u4e0b\uff0cMoHETS\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MSE\u6bd4\u8fd1\u671f\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e12%\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoHETS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoHE\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u957f\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MSE\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea612%\u3002"}}

We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.\n  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems.

Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The best-performing TDA methods exploits gradients to define an influence function. To overcome the scalability challenge arising from gradient computation, the most popular strategy is random projection (e.g., TRAK, LoGRA). However, this still faces two bottlenecks when scaling to large training sets and high-quality attribution: \\emph{(i)} storing and loading projected per-example gradients for all $N$ training examples, where query latency is dominated by I/O; and \\emph{(ii)} forming the $D \\times D$ inverse Hessian approximation, which costs $O(D^2)$ memory. Both bottlenecks scale with the projection dimension $D$, yet increasing $D$ is necessary for attribution quality -- creating a quality--scalability tradeoff. We introduce \\textbf{LoRIF (Low-Rank Influence Functions)}, which exploits low-rank structures of gradient to address both bottlenecks. First, we store rank-$c$ factors of the projected per-example gradients rather than full matrices, reducing storage and query-time I/O from $O(D)$ to $O(c\\sqrt{D})$ per layer per sample. Second, we use truncated SVD with the Woodbury identity to approximate the Hessian term in an $r$-dimensional subspace, reducing memory from $O(D^2)$ to $O(Dr)$. On models from 0.1B to 70B parameters trained on datasets with millions of examples, LoRIF achieves up to 20$\\times$ storage reduction and query-time speedup compared to LoGRA, while matching or exceeding its attribution quality.

We show that the magnitudes of the predictive variances considered exhibit varying degrees of correlation with the extent to which test inputs (ImageNet1K validation set augmented at various strengths, and other external datasets) are out-of-distribution relative to its training data, providing some insight into the effectiveness of their use as indicators of the trustworthiness of the FID.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5229\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57dropout\u4f30\u8ba1FID\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u5426\u4e3a OOD \u6709\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u5224\u65adFID\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Fidelity metrics\u5982FID\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684InceptionV3\uff0c\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57dropout\u8ba1\u7b97FID\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728ImageNet1K\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e OOD \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u7684 OOD \u6c34\u5e73\u5448\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30FID\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8868\u660e\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57dropout\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684FID\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u7684 OOD \u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30F\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u793a\u5668\u3002"}}

Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology.

However, E(3)-equivariant diffusion models often reproduce biases from semi-empirical training data rather than capturing the equilibrium distribution of a high-fidelity Hamiltonian. While physics-based guidance can correct this, it faces two computational bottlenecks: expensive quantum-chemical evaluations (e.g., DFT) and the need to repeat such queries at every sampling step. We present Elign, a post-training framework that amortizes both costs. First, we replace expensive DFT evaluations with a faster, pretrained foundational machine-learning force field (MLFF) to provide physical signals. Second, we eliminate repeated run-time queries by shifting physical steering to the training phase. To achieve the second amortization, we formulate reverse diffusion as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce Force--Energy Disentangled Group Relative Policy Optimization (FED-GRPO) to fine-tune the denoising policy. FED-GRPO includes a potential-based energy reward and a force-based stability reward, which are optimized and group-normalized independently.

We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length--curvature--kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness. We prove a solver-agnostic path-integral stability bound and derive gap-safe feasible regions that certify local stability away from switch regimes. Building on these results, we introduce \\textit{Homotopy-Tracking RL (HT-RL)} and \\textit{HT-MCTS}, lightweight wrappers that estimate replay-based proxies of length, curvature, and near-tie proximity online and adapt learning or planning intensity accordingly.

Despite its practical significance, it remains underexplored, primarily due to the technical complexity of handling their entanglement and the paucity of theoretical foundations. In this paper, we begin by theoretically establishing the generalization bound for IDG, highlighting the role of posterior discrepancy and decision margin. This bound motivates us to focus on directly steering decision boundaries, marking a clear departure from existing methods. Subsequently, we technically propose a novel Negative-Dominant Contrastive Learning (NDCL) for IDG to enhance discriminability while enforce posterior consistency across domains. Specifically, inter-class decision-boundary separation is enhanced by placing greater emphasis on negatives as the primary signal in our contrastive learning, naturally amplifying gradient signals for minority classes to avoid the decision boundary being biased toward majority classes.

We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\\textbf{R}$ea$\\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference.

Analysis of a tractable model formalizes this view, allowing us to identify best- and worst-case scenarios.

Selecting high-quality, diverse training sets for large language models (LLMs) is a difficult task, due to the lack of cheap and reliable quality metrics. While querying existing LLMs for document quality is common, this is not scalable to the large number (billions) of documents used in training. Instead, practitioners often use classifiers trained on sparse quality signals. In this paper, we propose a text-embedding-based hierarchical clustering approach that adaptively selects the documents to be evaluated by the LLM to estimate cluster quality. We prove that our method is query efficient: under the assumption that the hierarchical clustering contains a subtree such that each leaf cluster in the tree is pure enough (i.e., it mostly contains either only good or only bad documents), with high probability, the method can correctly predict the quality of each document after querying a small number of documents. The number of such documents is proportional to the size of the smallest subtree with (almost) pure leaves, without the algorithm knowing this subtree in advance.

In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens.

The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors.

Task arithmetic unlearns by subtracting a specific task vector (TV)--defined as the parameter difference between a privacy-information-tuned model and the original model. While efficient, it can cause over-forgetting by disrupting parameters essential for retaining other information. Motivated by the observation that each parameter exhibits different importance for forgetting versus retention, we propose a per-parameter task arithmetic (PerTA) mechanism to rescale the TV, allowing per-parameter adjustment. These weights quantify the relative importance of each parameter for forgetting versus retention, estimated via gradients (i.e., PerTA-grad) or the diagonal Fisher information approximation (i.e., PerTA-fisher). Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of PerTA, extend it to a more general form, and provide further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PerTA consistently improves upon standard TV, and in many cases surpasses widely used training-based unlearning methods in both forgetting effectiveness and overall model utility.

Existing distributional distance metrics conflate these factors, leading to measures that are not informative of the true extent of fusion between data groups. We introduce Cross-Fusion Distance (CFD), a principled measure that isolates fusion-altering geometry while remaining robust to fusion-preserving variations, with linear computational complexity.

M\u00fchlematter", "Alexander Becker", "Konrad Schindler", "Helge Aasen"], "title": "Making Foundation Models Probabilistic via Singular Value Ensembles", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models have become a dominant paradigm in machine learning, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining. However, these models often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The standard approach to quantifying epistemic uncertainty, training an ensemble of independent models, incurs prohibitive computational costs that scale linearly with ensemble size, making it impractical for large foundation models. We propose Singular Value Ensemble (SVE), a parameter-efficient implicit ensemble method that builds on a simple, but powerful core assumption: namely, that the singular vectors of the weight matrices constitute meaningful subspaces of the model's knowledge. Pretrained foundation models encode rich, transferable information in their weight matrices. If the singular vectors are indeed meaningful (orthogonal) \"knowledge directions\". To obtain a model ensemble, we modulate only how strongly each direction contributes to the output. Rather than learning entirely new parameters, we freeze the singular vectors and only train per-member singular values that rescale the contribution of each direction in that shared knowledge basis. Ensemble diversity emerges naturally as stochastic initialization and random sampling of mini-batches during joint training cause different members to converge to different combinations of the same underlying knowledge. SVE achieves uncertainty quantification comparable to explicit deep ensembles while increasing the parameter count of the base model by less than 1%, making principled uncertainty estimation accessible in resource-constrained settings.

While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers.

However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization.

Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural priors. PIFM bridges this gap by integrating embedding-based priors with continuous-time flow matching. Grounded in a permutation equivariant version of the distortion-perception theory, our method first uses a prior, such as graphons or GraphSAGE/node2vec, to form an informed initial estimate of the adjacency matrix based on local information. It then applies rectified flow matching to refine this estimate, transporting it toward the true distribution of clean graphs and learning a global coupling. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that PIFM consistently enhances classical embeddings, outperforming them and state-of-the-art generative baselines in reconstruction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $\u0394t$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u5747\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u53d7\u5c0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86 Mean Flow consistency \u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u7684 Hamiltonian \u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd Hamiltonian \u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60Hamiltonian Flow Maps\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u6a21\u62df Hamiltonian \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Notably, within the Llama-3.1-8B family, we find rarely downloaded checkpoints that improve math performance from 83.2% to 96.0% without increasing inference costs.
