More is known when the inner product is Euclidean than Hermitian. A shift to the latter is gaining traction. The focus is on a code whose Hermitian hull dimension and dual distance can be systematically determined. Such a code can serve as an ingredient in designing the parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs).\n  We use tools from algebraic function fields of one variable to efficiently determine a good lower bound on the Hermitian hull dimensions of generalized rational algebraic geometry (AG) codes. We identify families of AG codes whose hull dimensions can be well estimated by a lower bound. Given such a code, the idea is to select a set of evaluation points for which the residues of the Weil differential associated with the Hermitian dual code has an easily verifiable property.\n  The approach allows us to construct codes with designed Hermitian hull dimensions based on known results on Reed-Solomon codes and their generalization. Using the Hermitian method on these maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with designed hull dimensions yields two families of MDS EAQECCs. We confirm that the excellent parameters of the quantum codes from these families are new."}

Submitted for review to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing on December 18, 2025", "summary": "Recently, filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) technology has been proposed for use in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. It has been noted that, due to the spectral partitioning properties of the filter banks, a UWB signal can be synthesized and processed using a parallel set of signal processors operating at a moderate rate. This transceiver architecture can be used to generate UWB signals, without requiring a high-rate analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog converter. In this paper, beginning with a design operating on a single signal processor, we explore the development of a packet detector using the Rao score test. Taking advantage of the FBMC-SS signal structure, an effective detector design based on a cascade channelizer is proposed. We refer to this design as singe-radio band (SRB) detector. Given the typical bandwidth of UWB systems ($\\bf 500$~MHz or wider), the SRB detector has to operate at a fast sampling rate of greater than $\\bf 500$~MHz. This may be undesirable, as low cost analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are often limited to a sampling rate of $\\bf 200$~MHz or lower. Taking note of this point, the proposed SRB detector is extended to a multi-radio band (MRB) detector, where a set of parallel signal processors operating at a moderate sampling rate are used for a more practical implementation of the detector. Through computer simulations, we show that SRB and MRB detectors have the same performance in typical UWB channels. Finally, we provide results from an over-the-air demonstration of a UWB design occupying $\\bf 1.28$~GHz of bandwidth. We find that reliable detection performance is possible in the harshest environments, at signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\\bf -40$~dB with a preamble length of approximately half the duration of longest preamble length recommended in the IEEE802.15.4 standard."}

However, existing AIGC services typically operate within a centralized framework, resulting in high response times. To address this issue, we integrate collaborative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology to reduce processing delays for AIGC services. Current collaborative MEC methods primarily support single-server offloading or facilitate interactions among fixed Edge Servers (ESs), limiting flexibility and resource utilization across all ESs to meet the varying computing and networking requirements of AIGC services. We propose AMCoEdge, an adaptive multi-server collaborative MEC approach to enhancing AIGC service efficiency. The AMCoEdge fully utilizes the computing and networking resources across all ESs through adaptive multi-ES selection and dynamic workload allocation, thereby minimizing the offloading make-span of AIGC services. Our design features an online distributed algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, accompanied by theoretical analyses that confirm an approximate linear time complexity. Simulation results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least an 11.04% reduction in task offloading make-span and a 44.86% decrease in failure rate. Additionally, we develop a distributed prototype system to implement and evaluate our AMCoEdge method for real AIGC service execution, demonstrating service delays that are 9.23% - 31.98% lower than the three representative methods."}

This paper studies quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})$ and proposes various direct construction methods for such matrices. The construction is based on skew polynomial rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})[X;σ]$, whose rich factorization properties and enlarged class of polynomials are used to define companion matrices generating quasi-recursive MDS matrices. First, two criteria are established for characterizing polynomials that yield recursive MDS matrices, generalizing existing results, and then an additional criterion is derived in terms of the right roots of the associated Wedderburn polynomial. Using these criteria, methods are developed to construct skew polynomials that give rise to quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings. This framework extends known constructions to the non-commutative setting and significantly enlarges the family of available matrices, with potential applications to efficient diffusion layers in cryptographic primitives. The results are particularly relevant for practical implementations when $s = 1$ and $p = 2$, i.e., over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, which is of central interest in real-world cryptographic applications."}

Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements."}

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment."}

Instead of relying on supports or anticodes, the weights of a code are defined via the intersections of the code with a chosen family of spaces, which we call a test family. The choice of test family determines the properties of the corresponding generalized weights and the characteristics of the code that they capture. In this general framework, we prove that generalized weights are weakly increasing and that certain subsequences are strictly increasing. We also prove a duality result reminiscent of Wei's Duality Theorem. The corresponding properties of generalized Hamming and rank-metric weights follow from our general results by selecting optimal anticodes as a test family. For sum-rank metric codes, we propose a test family that results in generalized weights that are closely connected to -- but not always the same as -- the usual generalized weights. This choice allows us to extend the known duality results for generalized sum-rank weights to some sum-rank-metric codes with a nonzero Hamming component. Finally, we explore a family of generalized weights obtained by intersecting the underlying code with MDS or MRD codes."}

This paper introduces a novel approach to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in channel estimation between mobile users and rectangular Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) within wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, the user localization is realized based on the estimated Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, we assume a non-linear, user's position-dependent system model, for a user with high mobility, an RIS with multiple elements, and a base station (BS) with multiple antennas. After that, we apply the Kalman Filtering (KF) like algorithms to reduce MSE in estimating parameters of this time-variant channel model. Additionally, we propose a Non-Circular Noise Kalman Filter (NCNKF) to address scenarios with non-circular complex state-space noise. Furthermore, we apply the Discrete Space Fourier Transform (DSFT) method, combined with the interpolation techniques to decrease the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the user localization based on the estimated CSI. Finally, we extend the single-user case into the multi-user situation. Results show that KF can achieve lower MSE in estimating the channel than other known approaches, while the NCNKF algorithm has better performance in non-circular state-space noise scenarios. At the same time, the DSFT interpolation outperforms the other approaches with lower complexity. The study concludes with numerical comparisons and an in-depth discussion of the performance improvements enabled by our approaches."}

To bridge this gap, we propose BAID (Binding Agent ID), a comprehensive identity infrastructure establishing verifiable user-code binding. BAID integrates three orthogonal mechanisms: local binding via biometric authentication, decentralized on-chain identity management, and a novel zkVM-based Code-Level Authentication protocol. By leveraging recursive proofs to treat the program binary as the identity, this protocol provides cryptographic guarantees for operator identity, agent configuration integrity, and complete execution provenance, thereby effectively preventing unauthorized operation and code substitution. We implement and evaluate a complete prototype system, demonstrating the practical feasibility of blockchain-based identity management and zkVM-based authentication protocol."}

Classical multi-hypothesis likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are optimal for this task when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, yet in AmBC such CSI is difficult to obtain and track because the RF source is uncooperative and the tags are low-power passive devices. We first derive analytical performance bounds for an LRT receiver with perfect CSI to serve as a benchmark. We then propose two complementary deep learning frameworks that relax the CSI requirement while remaining modulation-agnostic. EmbedNet is an end-to-end prototypical network that maps covariance features of the received signal directly to multi-tag states. ChanEstNet is a hybrid scheme in which a convolutional neural network estimates effective channel coefficients from pilot symbols and passes them to a conventional LRT for interpretable multi-hypothesis detection. Simulations over diverse ambient sources and system configurations show that the proposed methods substantially reduce bit error rate, closely track the LRT benchmark, and significantly outperform energy detection baselines, especially as the number of tags increases."}

Existing WF methods rely on supervised learning with site-specific labeled traces, which limits scalability and fails to handle previously unseen websites. We address these limitations by reformulating WF as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem and introducing STAR. STAR learns a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and crawl-time logic profiles using a dual-encoder architecture. Trained on 150K automatically collected traffic-logic pairs with contrastive and consistency objectives and structure-aware augmentation, STAR retrieves the most semantically aligned profile for a trace without requiring target-side traffic during training. Experiments on 1,600 unseen websites show that STAR achieves 87.9 percent top-1 accuracy and 0.963 AUC in open-world detection, outperforming supervised and few-shot baselines. Adding an adapter with only four labeled traces per site further boosts top-5 accuracy to 98.8 percent. Our analysis reveals intrinsic semantic-traffic alignment in modern web protocols, identifying semantic leakage as the dominant privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic.

Classical Control Barrier Function (CBF) filters assume global availability of the safety function - its value and gradient must be known everywhere - an assumption incompatible with sensing-limited settings, and the resulting filters often exhibit nonsmooth switching when constraints activate. We propose two complementary perception-aware safety filters applicable to general control-invariant safety sets. The first introduces a smooth perception gate that modulates barrier constraints based on sensing range, yielding a closed-form Lipschitz-safe controller with forward-invariance guarantees. The second replaces the hard CBF constraint with a differentiable penalty term, leading to a smooth unconstrained optimization-based safety filter consistent with CBF principles. For both designs, we establish existence, uniqueness, and forward invariance of the closed-loop trajectories.

Existing solutions to driver isolation enforce an isolation model that cannot protect sub-page device resources.\n  This paper presents CAPIO, the first architecture to leverage hardware capabilities to enforce fine-grained access control on memory-mapped I/O.

Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance."}

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions.

This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications."}

Thus, we propose a novel model-based denoising method for dMRI that effectively accounts for the different noise characteristics of data. Methods: We propose a denoising strategy that incorporates full noise statistics, including the noise power spectral density (PSD), by leveraging the BM4D algorithm. Furthermore, to exploit redundancy across the diffusion MRI dataset, BM4D is applied to principal components (PC) of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the entire DWI dataset, an approach we refer to as BM4D-PC. Importantly, our method also allows for direct estimation of both the noise map and PSD. We evaluated BM4D-PC against four existing state-of-the-art methods using in-silico and in vivo datasets, including high-resolution human and marmoset acquisitions. Results: Overall, BM4D-PC presented the best results for the metrics PSNR, SSIM and RMSE on the in-silico experiments. The in-vivo studies also showed that BM4D-PC dramatically enhanced the image quality of raw DWIs, outperforming existing denoising methods in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation, leading to improved quality of diffusion metrics. Conclusion: The proposed BM4D-PC method demonstrated state-of-the-art denoising results for dMRI using datasets from various acquisition strategies and image resolutions, potentially supporting future advances in neuroscience research."}

Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies.

AutoDFBench 1.0 includes ground truth data comprising of 63 test cases and 10,968 unique test scenarios, and execute evaluations through a RESTful API that produces structured JSON outputs with standardised metrics, including precision, recall, and F1~score for each test case, and the average of these F1~scores becomes the AutoDFBench Score. The benchmarking framework is validated against CFTT's datasets. The framework enables fair and reproducible comparison across tools and forensic scripts, establishing the first unified, automated, and extensible benchmarking framework for digital forensic tool testing and validation.

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment."}

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures mitigate some of these conflicts, their routing mechanisms typically rely on explicitly trained auxiliary classifiers. This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.\n  Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \\textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \\textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \\textbf{99.47\\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \\textbf{47.76\\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \\textbf{0.57\\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).\n  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \\textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks."}

However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user's immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions, limiting the ability to assess their real-world effectiveness. To address this gap, this paper introduces Adversarial-VR, a novel real-time VR testbed for evaluating DL-based cybersickness detection and mitigation strategies under adversarial conditions. Developed in Unity, the testbed integrates two state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models: DeepTCN and Transformer, which are trained on the open-source MazeSick dataset, for real-time cybersickness severity detection and applies a dynamic visual tunneling mechanism that adjusts the field-of-view based on model outputs. To assess robustness, we incorporate three SOTA adversarial attacks: MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&W, which successfully prevent cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness models' outcomes. We implement these attacks using a testbed with a custom-built VR Maze simulation and an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and we open-source our implementation for widespread adoption by VR developers and researchers. Results show that these adversarial attacks are capable of successfully fooling the system. For instance, the C&W attack results in a $5.94x decrease in accuracy for the Transformer-based cybersickness model compared to the accuracy without the attack."}

Under this hybrid array architecture, the received uplink pilot signal at the BS is first combined by analog phase shifters, producing a low-dimensional observation before digital processing. Such analog compression provides only partial access to the ELAA measurement, making it essential to design an analog combiner that can preserve pose-relevant signal components despite channel uncertainty and unit-modulus hardware constraints. To address this, we propose a predictive analog combining-assisted extended Kalman filter (PAC-EKF) framework, where the analog combiner can leverage the temporal correlation in the MS pose variation to capture the most informative signal components predictively. We then analyze fundamental performance limits via Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound and Fisher information matrix, explicitly quantifying how the analog combiner, array size, signal-to-noise ratio, and MS pose influence the pose information contained in the uplink observation. Building on these insights, we develop two methods for designing a low-complexity analog combiner. Numerical results show that the proposed predictive analog combining approach significantly improves tracking accuracy, even with fewer RF chains and lower transmit power."}

This paper develops an analytical stochastic geometry (SG) framework for a multi-user system assisted by polar-domain beamfocusing, which jointly captures NF propagation characteristics and the spatial randomness of user locations. The intrinsic coupling between angle and distance in the NF antenna pattern renders inter-user interference analysis intractable.

The switching controller employs a feedback optimization control algorithm for the heating mode to adjust the laser power, and a triggering algorithm that increases the interlayer dwell time until the interlayer temperature reaches the reference value. Additionally, the study compares the performance of the proposed controller in both supported and unsupported overhanging parts to evaluate the effect of support structures on the controller performance as well as the thermal behavior of overhanging parts. Results demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing interlayer temperature across varying cross-sectional areas while remaining within the material's stable processing zone. In the heating mode, the controller efficiently stabilizes temperature, even in geometries with significant cross-section variation. The study also identifies trade-offs among process efficiency, energy consumption, and build time. Supported parts exhibit reduced overheating but consume more energy and material, while unsupported parts stabilize interlayer temperature faster but with longer build times due to increased dwell time assignments. The research highlights notable improvements in interlayer temperature control for geometries prone to excessive thermal stresses. Moreover, the introduction of interlayer dwell time offers a practical solution to maintaining thermal stability in complex geometries."}

Non-rare fields are privatized with RAPPOR, giving unbiased frequency estimates under local DP. A global aggregator enforces composition and budget. This two-tier design hides rare events and adds controlled noise to frequent events. We prove limits of PAC extension to global aggregation, give bounds for RAPPOR estimates, and analyze utility trade-off. A toy simulation confirms feasibility: rare categories remain hidden, frequent categories are recovered with small error."}

By activating radiating elements at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide, PAS can establish strong line-of-sight (LoS) links with users, significantly enhancing channel gain and deployment flexibility, particularly in high-frequency bands susceptible to severe path loss. To further improve multi-user performance, this paper introduces a novel content-aware transmission framework that integrates PAS with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Unlike conventional RSMA, the proposed RSMA scheme enables users requesting the same content to share a unified private stream, thereby mitigating inter-user interference and reducing power fragmentation. We formulate a joint optimization problem aimed at minimizing the average system latency by dynamically adapting both antenna positioning and RSMA parameters according to channel conditions and user requests. A Content-Aware RSMA and Pinching-antenna Joint Optimization (CARP-JO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the non-convex problem into tractable subproblems solved via bisection search, convex programming, and golden-section search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CARP-JO scheme consistently outperforms Traditional RSMA, NOMA, and Fixed-antenna systems across diverse network scenarios in terms of latency, underscoring the effectiveness of co-designing physical-layer reconfigurability with intelligent communication strategies."}

We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance."}

While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand sensing tasks, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable throughput among all communication users, via joint optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication user scheduling. To address the complicated problem with infinite sensing constraints, we characterize the on-demand detection constraint as a restricted deployment area for UAV and the on-demand localization constraint as Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints over finite reference target points, based on which the original problem is simplified to more tractable one. Afterwards, particularly aiming to ensure no violations of CRB constraints, we propose a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, where tight approximation is guaranteed at given local solution. The construction strategy for convex problem approximation allows an efficient iterative algorithm with verified convergence to a superior suboptimal solution. At last, with simulations, we verified the applicability of our developed optimization scheme in strictly fulfilling the on-demand sensing constraints and the effectiveness of our proposed solution for simultaneously enhancing the communication throughput in UAV-enabled ISAC."}

To address this, we propose ABBR, a practical framework for Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL. We are the first to utilize dimensionality reduction to speed up the private computation of complex filtering rules in privacy-preserving FL.

This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications."}

This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement."}

These streams are often derived from sensitive user activity, making update-level privacy guarantees necessary. While recent work has adapted the classical heavy hitter algorithm Misra-Gries to satisfy differential privacy in the streaming model, the privatization of other heavy hitter algorithms with better empirical utility is absent.\n  Under this observation, we present the first differentially private variant of the SpaceSaving algorithm, which, in the non-private setting, is regarded as the state-of-the-art in practice. Our construction post-processes a non-private SpaceSaving summary by injecting asymptotically optimal noise and applying a carefully calibrated selection rule that suppresses unstable labels. This yields strong privacy guarantees while preserving the empirical advantages of SpaceSaving.\n  Second, we introduce a generic method for extracting heavy hitters from any differentially private frequency oracle in the data stream model. The method requires only O(k) additional memory, where k is the number of heavy items, and provides a mechanism for safely releasing item identities from noisy frequency estimates. This yields an efficient, plug-and-play approach for private heavy hitter recovery from linear sketches.\n  Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets. Across a wide range of privacy parameters and space budgets, our method provides superior utility to the existing differentially private Misra-Gries algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the empirical superiority of SpaceSaving survives privatization and that efficient, practical heavy hitter identification is achievable under strong differential privacy guarantees."}

However, applying Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to ECG signals presents a unique challenge: standard imperceptible noise constraints (e.g., 10 uV) fail to generate effective universal attacks due to the high inter-subject variability of cardiac waveforms. Furthermore, traditional \"invisible\" attacks are easily dismissed by clinicians as technical artifacts, failing to compromise the human-in-the-loop diagnostic pipeline. In this study, we propose SCAR (Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation), a novel UAP framework tailored to bypass the clinical \"Human Firewall.\" Unlike traditional approaches, SCAR integrates spatiotemporal smoothing (W=25, approx. 50ms), spectral consistency (<15 Hz), and anatomical amplitude constraints (<0.2 mV) directly into the gradient optimization manifold.\n  Results: We benchmarked SCAR against a rigorous baseline (Standard Universal DeepFool with post-hoc physiological filtering). While the baseline suffers a performance collapse (~16% success rate on transfer tasks), SCAR maintains robust transferability (58.09% on ResNet) and achieves 82.46% success on the source model. Crucially, clinical analysis reveals an emergent targeted behavior: SCAR specifically converges to forging Myocardial Infarction features (90.2% misdiagnosis) by mathematically reconstructing pathological ST-segment elevations. Finally, we demonstrate that SCAR serves a dual purpose: it not only functions as a robust data augmentation strategy for Hybrid Adversarial Training, offering optimal clinical defense, but also provides effective educational samples for training clinicians to recognize low-cost, AI-targeted semantic forgeries."}

Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways.

To fill this gap, we present the first cryptanalysis of PRC. We first propose three attacks to challenge the undetectability and robustness assumptions of PRC. Among them, two attacks aim to distinguish PRC-based codewords from plain vectors, and one attack aims to compromise the decoding process of PRC. Our attacks successfully undermine the claimed security guarantees across all parameter configurations. Notably, our attack can detect the presence of a watermark with overwhelming probability at a cost of $2^{22}$ operations. We also validate our approach by attacking real-world large generative models such as DeepSeek and Stable Diffusion. To mitigate our attacks, we further propose three defenses to enhance the security of PRC, including parameter suggestions, implementation suggestions, and constructing a revised key generation algorithm. Our proposed revised key generation function effectively prevents the occurrence of weak keys. However, we highlight that the current PRC-based watermarking scheme still cannot achieve a 128-bit security under our parameter suggestions due to the inherent configurations of large generative models, such as the maximum output length of large language models."}

Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward.

On the other side, some references and also our studies demonstrate that AFDM involves an unneeded matrix, which is based on a parameter typically represented by $c_2$, for signalling. Hence, in this paper, an augmented AFDM scheme, referred to as A$^2$FDM, is proposed to mitigate the PAPR problem of AFDM, which is achieved by replacing the $c_2$ matrix in AFDM by a new unitary matrix that performs both sub-block-based Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and symbol mapping. Two symbol mapping schemes, namely interleaved mapping and localized mapping, are proposed for implementing A$^2$FDM, yielding the Interleaved A$^2$FDM and Localized A$^2$FDM. The input-output relationships of these schemes are derived and the complexity and the effects of system parameters on the performance of A$^2$FDM along with AFDM systems are analyzed. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to demonstrate and compare comprehensively the performance of the considered schemes in conjunction with different system settings and various operational conditions. Our studies and results demonstrate that, while A$^2$FDM is capable of circumventing the PAPR problem faced by AFDM, it is capable of attaining the achievable diversity gain, when AFDM is operated in its undesirable conditions resulting in the loss of the diversity gain available."}

However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning."}

Most existing deep learning based malware detectors rely on closed world assumptions and fail to adequately model this intra class variation, resulting in degraded performance when confronted with previously unseen malware families. This paper presents MADOOD, a novel two stage, cluster driven deep learning framework for robust OOD malware detection and classification. In the first stage, malware family embeddings are modeled using class conditional spherical decision boundaries derived from Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), enabling statistically grounded separation of indistribution and OOD samples without requiring OOD data during training. Z score based distance analysis across multiple class centroids is employed to reliably identify anomalous samples in the latent space. In the second stage, a deep neural network integrates cluster based predictions, refined embeddings, and supervised classifier outputs to enhance final classification accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark malware datasets comprising 25 known families and multiple novel OOD variants demonstrate that MADOOD significantly outperforms state of the art OOD detection methods, achieving an AUC of up to 0.911 on unseen malware families. The proposed framework provides a scalable, interpretable, and statistically principled solution for real world malware detection and anomaly identification in evolving cybersecurity environments."}

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-destructive geophysical technique widely used to characterize subsurface conditions. Data-driven parameter estimation methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which is expensive to obtain from real-world GPR scans under diverse subsurface conditions. A physics-based GPR model using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be employed to generate large synthetic datasets through simulations across varying material parameters, which are then utilized to train data-driven models. A key limitation, however, is that simulated data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain) often follow different distributions, which can cause data-driven models trained on simulations to underperform in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation framework with deep adversarial learning for robust subsurface material property estimation from GPR signals. The proposed framework is systematically evaluated through the laboratory tests for single- and two-layer materials, as well as the field tests for single- and two-layer materials, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and domain adversarial neural network (DANN). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher correlation coefficients R and lower Bias between the predicted and measured parameter values, along with smaller standard deviations in the estimations, thereby validating their effectiveness in bridging the domain gap between simulated and real-world radar signals and enabling efficient subsurface material property retrieval."}

The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling."}

Using transaction level data from November 2024 to February 2025, enriched with mempool visibility and ZeroMEV labels, we track user outcomes after their n-th public sandwich: (i) reactivation, i.e., the resumption of on-chain activity within a 60-day window, and (ii) first-time adoption of private routing. We refer to users who do not reactivate within this window as churned, and to users experiencing multiple attacks (n>1) as undergoing repeated exposure. Our analysis reveals measurable behavioral adaptation: around 40% of victims migrate to private routing within 60 days, rising to 54% with repeated exposures. Churn peaks at 7.5% after the first sandwich but declines to 1-2%, consistent with survivor bias. In Nov-Dec 2024 we confirm 2,932 private sandwich attacks affecting 3,126 private victim transactions, producing \\$409,236 in losses and \\$293,786 in attacker profits. A single bot accounts for nearly two-thirds of private frontruns, and private sandwich activity is heavily concentrated on a small set of DEX pools. These results highlight that private routing does not guarantee protection from MEV extraction: while execution failures push users toward private channels, these remain exploitable and highly concentrated, demanding continuous monitoring and protocol-level defenses."}

Unlike existing works, which only consider the preamble detection for a single target end devices (ED), we proposed to simultaneously detect the preambles of multiple EDs that asynchronously transmit their uplink (UL) packets to a multiple-antenna gateway (GW). First we show that the preamble detection in multiuser LoRa networks with the conventional single-chirp preamble suffers from the so-called preamble resemblance effect. This means that the preamble of any single ED can resemble the preambles of all EDs in the network, and make it impossible to determine to which ED a preamble belongs. To address this problem, a novel double-chirp preamble design and a preamble assignment method are proposed, which can mitigate the preamble resemblance effect by making the preamble of each ED unique and recognizable. Next, a maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection scheme for the proposed double-chirp preamble is derived. Finally, since the proposed algorithm requires the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) every sampling period, we proposed a low-complexity technique to calculate the DFT recursively to reduce the complexity of our proposed design. Simulation shows that the proposed preamble detection design and detection requires just about 2 dB more power to increase the number of EDs from one to 15 in the Rayleigh fading channel while achieving the same preamble detection error performance."}

However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications."}

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength.

We address these limitations by reformulating WF as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem and introducing STAR. STAR learns a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and crawl-time logic profiles using a dual-encoder architecture. Trained on 150K automatically collected traffic-logic pairs with contrastive and consistency objectives and structure-aware augmentation, STAR retrieves the most semantically aligned profile for a trace without requiring target-side traffic during training. Experiments on 1,600 unseen websites show that STAR achieves 87.9 percent top-1 accuracy and 0.963 AUC in open-world detection, outperforming supervised and few-shot baselines. Adding an adapter with only four labeled traces per site further boosts top-5 accuracy to 98.8 percent. Our analysis reveals intrinsic semantic-traffic alignment in modern web protocols, identifying semantic leakage as the dominant privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic.

The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines.

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality."}

We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels. We then extend this idea to work across different layers.\n  We show that this formulation can drastically reduce the number of DReLU operations in resnet type network. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that this new formulation can solve an extended version of the XOR problem, using just one non-linearity and two neurons, something that traditional formulations and some PI specific methods cannot achieve. We achieve new SOTA results on several classification setups, and achieve SOTA results on image segmentation."}

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues."}

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants."}

We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection.

This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations.

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincaré ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines. Extensive study shows that our model effectively addresses major challenges, including sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start, while maintaining moderate computational overhead, underscoring its capability for reliable joint QoS prediction."}

Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization."}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals.

The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation.

Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level.

The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics.

However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability.

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality."}

It has been observed that a major computational bottleneck of PI is the calculation of the gate (i.e., ReLU), so a considerable amount of effort have been devoted to reducing the number of ReLUs in a given network.\n  We focus on the DReLU, which is the non-linear step function of the ReLU and show that one DReLU can serve many ReLU operations. We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels. We then extend this idea to work across different layers.\n  We show that this formulation can drastically reduce the number of DReLU operations in resnet type network.

Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways."}

Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds.

This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility.

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving."}

In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results."}

Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations.

In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis."}

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources."}

On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not."}

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments."}

We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests."}

While this experience learning capability enhances agentic autonomy, it introduces a critical, unexplored attack surface, i.e., the trust boundary between an agent's reasoning core and its own past. In this paper, we introduce MemoryGraft. It is a novel indirect injection attack that compromises agent behavior not through immediate jailbreaks, but by implanting malicious successful experiences into the agent's long-term memory. Unlike traditional prompt injections that are transient, or standard RAG poisoning that targets factual knowledge, MemoryGraft exploits the agent's semantic imitation heuristic which is the tendency to replicate patterns from retrieved successful tasks. We demonstrate that an attacker who can supply benign ingestion-level artifacts that the agent reads during execution can induce it to construct a poisoned RAG store where a small set of malicious procedure templates is persisted alongside benign experiences. When the agent later encounters semantically similar tasks, union retrieval over lexical and embedding similarity reliably surfaces these grafted memories, and the agent adopts the embedded unsafe patterns, leading to persistent behavioral drift across sessions. We validate MemoryGraft on MetaGPT's DataInterpreter agent with GPT-4o and find that a small number of poisoned records can account for a large fraction of retrieved experiences on benign workloads, turning experience-based self-improvement into a vector for stealthy and durable compromise.

This agentic process enables continuous evaluation of embedding-space robustness without modifying the underlying model.

The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness.

This paper presents MADOOD, a novel two stage, cluster driven deep learning framework for robust OOD malware detection and classification. In the first stage, malware family embeddings are modeled using class conditional spherical decision boundaries derived from Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), enabling statistically grounded separation of indistribution and OOD samples without requiring OOD data during training. Z score based distance analysis across multiple class centroids is employed to reliably identify anomalous samples in the latent space. In the second stage, a deep neural network integrates cluster based predictions, refined embeddings, and supervised classifier outputs to enhance final classification accuracy. Extensive evaluations on benchmark malware datasets comprising 25 known families and multiple novel OOD variants demonstrate that MADOOD significantly outperforms state of the art OOD detection methods, achieving an AUC of up to 0.911 on unseen malware families.
