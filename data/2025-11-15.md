TL;DR: 提出两类参数化的改进式 Bandits 算法族，并利用离线数据学习近优策略的样本复杂度界；在奖励曲线具备强凹性条件时，第一族可实现对 k 的最优依赖；第二族在良好实例下保证最优臂识别，在差劣实例下回落到最坏情形，同时给出数据自适应的保证，无需显式验证假设。

Motivation: 改进带不确定性的资源分配问题的理论建模——改进型多臂赌博机；每次拉臂的奖励单调增大、边际收益下降；在面对离散的强下界 Ω(k) 与 Ω(√k) 的 Worst-Case 保证时，探索更具数据依赖性的算法以提升实际表现，特别是在奖励曲线具有凹性性质时。

Method: 提出两类参数化的算法族，并基于离线数据对学习出近似最优算法的样本复杂度进行理论界定。第一族包含之前最优的随机算法；在奖励曲线的凹性强度满足额外条件时，选取该族中的算法可获得关于 k 的最优依赖。第二族在良好实例上保证能正确识别最佳臂，在不良实例上退化回最坏情形，并从统计学习角度提供数据驱动的保证。

Result: 第一族在强凹性条件下实现对 k 的最优依赖的更强保证；第二族实现对良好实例的最佳臂识别并对差劣实例回落到最坏情形，同时无需显式验证假设即可获得更强的数据依赖保证。

Conclusion: 通过将改进型 Bandits 与统计学习视角结合，提出的两族算法提供了基于离线数据的更强数据相关保证，实现对实例的自适应处理，弥合了严格最坏情况界与更实现性的数据驱动表现之间的差距。

Abstract: The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

Motivation: Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools and domain expertise; when network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling.

Method: ArachNet employs four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation; the system autonomously generates measurement workflows and integrates multi-framework tooling; validation is conducted across progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios.

Result: Generated workflows match expert-level reasoning and produce outputs similar to specialist solutions; they handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination.

Conclusion: ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process used by experts, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining research-grade analytical rigor.

Abstract: Internet measurement research faces an accessibility crisis: complex analyses require custom integration of multiple specialized tools that demands specialized domain expertise. When network disruptions occur, operators need rapid diagnostic workflows spanning infrastructure mapping, routing analysis, and dependency modeling. However, developing these workflows requires specialized knowledge and significant manual effort.
  We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning. Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.
