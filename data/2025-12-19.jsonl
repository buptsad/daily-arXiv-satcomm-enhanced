This work introduces a diffusion-based generative framework for linear controller synthesis grounded in the Youla-Kucera parameterization, enabling the construction of stabilizing controllers by design. The diffusion model learns a conditional mapping from plant dynamics and desired performance metrics to feasible Youla parameters, guaranteeing internal stability while flexibly accommodating user-specified targets. Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling."}

A closed-loop simulation environment is provided, featuring realistic actuator constraints, gas transport delays, stiff integration, and a fully specified scenario based on multi-day outdoor disturbances (irradiance, temperature, wind, and humidity). Four user-replaceable controllers define the manipulation of CO2 injection, air bubbling, harvest/dilution sequencing, and heat-exchanger operation. The platform computes a unified global performance index, in addition to individual metrics for each control problem, combining tracking error, gas and energy usage, and biomass productivity, enabling consistent and quantitative comparison of alternative control strategies. Baseline regulatory architectures (On/Off, PI/PID, and Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC)) are included to illustrate the benchmark use for classical and advanced control methods.

While transformers have shown promise in various control applications due to sequential modeling through self-attention mechanisms, they have not been used within adaptive control architectures that provide stability guarantees. Existing transformer-based approaches for control rely on offline training with fixed weights, resulting in open-loop implementations that lack real-time adaptation capabilities and stability assurances. To address these limitations, a continuous LyAT controller is developed that adaptively estimates drift and diffusion uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems without requiring offline pre-training. A key innovation is the analytically derived adaptation law constructed from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, which enables real-time weight updates while guaranteeing probabilistic uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking and parameter estimation errors. Experimental validation on a quadrotor demonstrates the performance of the developed controller."}

Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data.

Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach."}

Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist."}

This paper presents a Variable Record Table (VRT) with a unified hardware- assisted framework that simultaneously enforces spatial memory safety against buffer overflows, back-edge control-flow integrity (CFI), and speculative execution attack detection. The VRT dynamically constructs a protection table by instrumenting run- time instructions to extract memory addresses, bounds metadata, and control-flow signatures. Our evaluation across MiBench and SPEC benchmarks shows that VRT successfully detects all attack variants tested with zero additional instruction overhead. Fur- thermore, it maintains memory requirements below 25KB (for 512 entries) and maintains area / power overhead under 8% and 11.65 μW, respectively. By consolidating three essential security mechanisms into a single hardware structure, VRT provides comprehensive protection while minimizing performance impact."}

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."}

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF."}

We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data."}

While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR."}

Owing to their unique combination of efficiency, scalability, and expressive capacity, SSMs have become compelling alternatives to transformer-based models, which suffer from the quadratic computational and memory costs of attention mechanisms. As SSMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is critical to assess their susceptibility to both software- and hardware-level threats to ensure secure and reliable operation. Among such threats, hardware-induced bit-flip attacks (BFAs) pose a particularly severe risk by corrupting model parameters through memory faults, thereby undermining model accuracy and functional integrity. To investigate this vulnerability, we introduce RAMBO, the first BFA framework specifically designed to target Mamba-based architectures. Through experiments on the Mamba-1.4b model with LAMBADA benchmark, a cloze-style word-prediction task, we demonstrate that flipping merely a single critical bit can catastrophically reduce accuracy from 74.64% to 0% and increase perplexity from 18.94 to 3.75 x 10^6.

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of RIS applications in real-world systems, with a focus on the security and privacy threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies relevant to practical use. We analyze scenarios with two types of systems (with and without legitimate RIS) and two types of attackers (with and without malicious RIS), and demonstrate how RIS may introduce new attacks to practical systems, including eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. In response, we review defenses against RIS-related attacks in these systems, such as applying additional security algorithms, disrupting attackers, and early detection of unauthorized RIS. We also discuss scenarios in which the legitimate user applies an additional RIS to defend against attacks. To support future research, we also provide a collection of open-source tools, datasets, demos, and papers at: https://awesome-ris-security.github.io/.

Accordingly, we derive closedform expressions for both average minimum DEP (AMDEP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC). To balance AMDEP and ASC, we propose a new performance metric and design an algorithm based on generative diffusion models (GDM) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The algorithm maximizes data rates under user mobility while ensuring high AMDEP and ASC by optimizing power allocation.

In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications."}

Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold.

Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric."}

Especially in high-mobility scenarios with fast time-varying channels, it is crucial for resisting channel aging and ensuring communication quality. However, existing methods suffer from high complexity and the inability to accurately model the temporal variations of channels. To address this issue, this paper proposes CPMamba -- an efficient channel prediction framework based on the selective state space model. The proposed CPMamba architecture extracts features from historical channel state information (CSI) using a specifically designed feature extraction and embedding network and employs stacked residual Mamba modules for temporal modeling. By leveraging an input-dependent selective mechanism to dynamically adjust state transitions, it can effectively capture the long-range dependencies between the CSIs while maintaining a linear computational complexity. Simulation results under the 3GPP standard channel model demonstrate that CPMamba achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy across all scenarios, along with superior generalization and robustness. Compared to existing baseline models, CPMamba reduces the number of parameters by approximately 50 percent while achieving comparable or better performance, thereby significantly lowering the barrier for practical deployment."}

However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution.

Concretely, I wrap Mistral-7B-Instruct with modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier, then evaluate candidate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Each configuration is scored using malware and jailbreak attack success rate, benign harmful-response rate, and end-to-end latency.

Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods."}

In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks."}

We provide rigorous mathematical instantiations for CTDE MARL algorithms and RAG-based LLM agents, demonstrating that bilevel optimization uniquely crafts stealthy, minimal-perturbation poisons evading detection heuristics. Comprehensive experimental protocols utilize SMAC and SafeRAG benchmarks to quantify effectiveness at sub-percent poison rates (less than or equal to 1 percent in MARL, less than or equal to 0.1 percent in RAG).

In particular, the infinite-dimensional feature map induced by the neural tangent kernel is not translationally invariant. This means that the study of an out-of-distribution evaluation point very far from the origin is not equivalent to the evaluation of a point very near the origin. And since the feature map is rotation invariant, these two special cases may represent the most canonically extreme bounds of ReLU NTK extrapolation. Ultimately, it is this loose recognition of the two special cases of extrapolation that motivate the discovery of quadratic extrapolation for an evaluation close to the origin."}

To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of ε-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an ε*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results."}

This paper introduces the \\textbf{Attribute Misbinding Attack}, a novel method that poses a threat to identity-preserving models by inducing them to produce Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. The attack's core idea involves crafting benign-looking textual prompts to circumvent text-filter safeguards and leverage a key model vulnerability: flawed attribute binding that stems from its internal attention bias. This results in misattributing harmful descriptions to a target identity and generating NSFW outputs. To facilitate the study of this attack, we present the \\textbf{Misbinding Prompt} evaluation set, which examines the content generation risks of current state-of-the-art identity-preserving models across four risk dimensions: pornography, violence, discrimination, and illegality.

They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets.

In response, we review defenses against RIS-related attacks in these systems, such as applying additional security algorithms, disrupting attackers, and early detection of unauthorized RIS.

Trusted for their ability to act without direct oversight, such agents are increasingly considered in high-stakes domains including financial management, dispute resolution, and governance. Yet in practice, agents execute on infrastructure controlled by a host, who can tamper with models, inputs, or outputs, undermining any meaningful notion of autonomy.\n  We address this gap by introducing VET (Verifiable Execution Traces), a formal framework that achieves host-independent authentication of agent outputs and takes a step toward host-independent autonomy. Central to VET is the Agent Identity Document (AID), which specifies an agent's configuration together with the proof systems required for verification. VET is compositional: it supports multiple proof mechanisms, including trusted hardware, succinct cryptographic proofs, and notarized TLS transcripts (Web Proofs).\n  We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads. We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient. As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy. Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy."}

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."}

This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists.

However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI."}

Many privacy-preserving methods are proposed to protect the information leakage in the context, but there are less efforts on how to audit those methods. We introduce ContextLeak, the first framework to empirically measure the worst-case information leakage in ICL. ContextLeak uses canary insertion, embedding uniquely identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting targeted queries to detect their presence. We apply ContextLeak across a range of private ICL techniques, both heuristic such as prompt-based defenses and those with theoretical guarantees such as Embedding Space Aggregation and Report Noisy Max.

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows."}

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."}

To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard, the first watermarking algorithm capable of defending against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks. DualGuard employs the adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism, in which two complementary watermark signals are dynamically injected based on the semantic content. This design enables DualGuard not only to detect but also to trace spoofing attacks, thereby ensuring reliable and trustworthy watermark detection. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and language models demonstrate that DualGuard achieves excellent detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality, effectively advancing the state of LLM watermarking for real-world applications."}

While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models."}

Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues.

However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements."}

In this paper, we propose ICP-MIA, a novel MIA framework grounded in the theory of training dynamics, particularly the phenomenon of diminishing returns during optimization. We introduce the Optimization Gap as a fundamental signal of membership: at convergence, member samples exhibit minimal remaining loss-reduction potential, while non-members retain significant potential for further optimization. To estimate this gap in a black-box setting, we propose In-Context Probing (ICP), a training-free method that simulates fine-tuning-like behavior via strategically constructed input contexts. We propose two probing strategies: reference-data-based (using semantically similar public samples) and self-perturbation (via masking or generation). Experiments on three tasks and multiple LLMs show that ICP-MIA significantly outperforms prior black-box MIAs, particularly at low false positive rates. We further analyze how reference data alignment, model type, PEFT configurations, and training schedules affect attack effectiveness.

Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation."}

We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624.

In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space.

From each study, we extracted data on study design, IoT type, SPAU measures, and identified research gaps. We introduce the SPAU-IoT Framework, which comprises 27 criteria across four dimensions: security (e.g., resilience to cyber threats, secure authentication, encrypted communication, secure-by-default settings, and guardianship features), privacy (e.g., data minimization, explicit consent, and privacy-preserving analytics), accessibility (e.g., compliance with ADA/WCAG standards and assistive-technology compatibility), and usability (e.g., guided interaction, integrated assistance, and progressive learning). Applying this framework revealed that more than 70% of studies implemented authentication and encryption mechanisms, whereas fewer than 50% addressed accessibility or usability concerns. We further developed a threat model that maps IoT assets, networks, and backend servers to exploit vectors such as phishing, caregiver exploitation, and weak-password attacks, explicitly accounting for age-related vulnerabilities including cognitive decline and sensory impairment. Our results expose a systemic lack of integrated SPAU approaches in existing IoT research and translate these gaps into actionable, standards-aligned design guidelines for IoT systems designed for older adults."}

Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain."}

Existing methods protect the intellectual property of EaaS through watermarking techniques, but they all ignore the most important properties of embedding: semantics, resulting in limited harmlessness and stealthiness. To this end, we propose SemMark, a novel semantic-based watermarking paradigm for EaaS copyright protection. SemMark employs locality-sensitive hashing to partition the semantic space and inject semantic-aware watermarks into specific regions, ensuring that the watermark signals remain imperceptible and diverse. In addition, we introduce the adaptive watermark weight mechanism based on the local outlier factor to preserve the original embedding distribution. Furthermore, we propose Detect-Sampling and Dimensionality-Reduction attacks and construct four scenarios to evaluate the watermarking method.

Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability."}

In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection."}

Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels.

Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical."}

The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods."}

However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay."}

In this work, we present AIE4ML, the first comprehensive framework for converting AI models automatically into optimized firmware targeting the AIE-ML generation devices, also with forward compatibility for the newer AIE-MLv2 architecture. At the single-kernel level, we attain performance close to the architectural peak. At the graph and system levels, we provide a structured parallelization method that can scale across the 2D AIE-ML fabric and exploit its dedicated memory tiles to stay entirely on-chip throughout the model execution. As a demonstration, we designed a generalized and highly efficient linear-layer implementation with intrinsic support for fused bias addition and ReLU activation. Also, as our framework necessitates the generation of multi-layer implementations, our approach systematically derives deterministic, compact, and topology-optimized placements tailored to the physical 2D grid of the device through a novel graph placement and search algorithm. Finally, the framework seamlessly accepts quantized models imported from high-level tools such as hls4ml or PyTorch while preserving bit-exactness.

In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint.

The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency.

However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states.

However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance."}

While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications."}

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training."}

In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur."}

Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."}

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting."}

Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance.

Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains.

This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility.

Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds.

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers.

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively.

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."}

To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components."}

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication.

For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours.

To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI."}

Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps."}

This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, and domain-based features from the URLs. On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction.

However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design."}

Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available."}

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes."}

TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints.

Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents.

This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire."}

This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting.

Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use.

However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage."}

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning."}

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."}

This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chains, namely Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers during generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. Furthermore, we discover an Early-Stage Trigger Manifestation (ESTM) phenomenon: backdoor trigger patterns tend to surface more explicitly in the early, high-noise stages of the diffusion model's reverse generation process before being subtly integrated into the final samples. Overall, this work reveals a previously underexplored threat in generative data pipelines and provides initial insights toward mitigating backdoor risks in synthetic data generation."}

Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers. This result confirms that SVM accomplishes the highest accuracy among the evaluated classifiers. We validated the effectiveness of all classifiers using a tenfold cross-validation approach, incorporating Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection to enhance the classifiers accuracy and efficiency. Our outcomes indicate that ML classifiers are both adaptable and reliable, contributing to enhanced accuracy in systems for detecting network intrusions."}

In practice these guardrails are typically hand-tuned, brittle, and difficult to reproduce. This paper studies a simple but practical alternative: treat safety guardrail design itself as a hyperparameter optimization problem over a frozen base model. Concretely, I wrap Mistral-7B-Instruct with modular jailbreak and malware system prompts plus a ModernBERT-based harmfulness classifier, then evaluate candidate configurations on three public benchmarks covering malware generation, classic jailbreak prompts, and benign user queries. Each configuration is scored using malware and jailbreak attack success rate, benign harmful-response rate, and end-to-end latency. A 48-point grid search over prompt combinations and filter modes establishes a baseline. I then run a black-box Optuna study over the same space and show that it reliably rediscovers the best grid configurations while requiring an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and roughly 8x less wall-clock time. The results suggest that viewing safety guardrails as tunable hyperparameters is a feasible way to harden black-box LLM deployments under compute and time constraints."}

During this exposure window, affected systems remain defenseless, making zero-day attacks particularly damaging and difficult to mitigate. This study analyzes the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) vulnerability disclosures reported between January and April 2024, Cole [2025] comprising a total of 415 vulnerabilities. The dataset includes vulnerability identifiers, Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.0 scores, publication dates, and short textual descriptions. The primary objectives of this work are to identify trends in zero-day vulnerability disclosures, examine severity distributions across vendors, and investigate which vulnerability characteristics are most indicative of high severity. In addition, this study explores predictive modeling approaches for severity classification, comparing classical machine learning techniques with deep learning models using both structured metadata and unstructured textual descriptions. The findings aim to support improved patch prioritization strategies, more effective vulnerability management, and enhanced organizational preparedness against emerging zero-day threats."}

This work focuses on reducing bandwidth consumption and encryption/decryption delay, two key contributors to overall latency. We design a system that downsamples point cloud content at the origin server and applies partial encryption. At the client, the content is decrypted and upscaled using an ML-based super-resolution model. Our evaluation demonstrates a nearly linear reduction in bandwidth/latency, and encryption/decryption overhead with lower downsampling resolutions, while the super-resolution model effectively reconstructs the original full-resolution point clouds with minimal error and modest inference time."}

They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements."}

However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge or large datasets. We introduce a criterion for dependence, whereby two time series are deemed dependent if one can construct a classifier that distinguishes between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data."}

While prior black-box MIA techniques rely on confidence scores or token likelihoods, these signals are often entangled with a sample's intrinsic properties - such as content difficulty or rarity - leading to poor generalization and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose ICP-MIA, a novel MIA framework grounded in the theory of training dynamics, particularly the phenomenon of diminishing returns during optimization. We introduce the Optimization Gap as a fundamental signal of membership: at convergence, member samples exhibit minimal remaining loss-reduction potential, while non-members retain significant potential for further optimization. To estimate this gap in a black-box setting, we propose In-Context Probing (ICP), a training-free method that simulates fine-tuning-like behavior via strategically constructed input contexts. We propose two probing strategies: reference-data-based (using semantically similar public samples) and self-perturbation (via masking or generation). Experiments on three tasks and multiple LLMs show that ICP-MIA significantly outperforms prior black-box MIAs, particularly at low false positive rates. We further analyze how reference data alignment, model type, PEFT configurations, and training schedules affect attack effectiveness. Our findings establish ICP-MIA as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for auditing privacy risks in deployed LLMs."}

In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection."}

However, most deep-learning-based methods rely on extensive data or require prior information, which poses challenges in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose an integrated complex variational mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes and reconstructs complex-valued signals to approximate the original transmitted signals, thereby enabling more accurate feature extraction. We further utilize a temporal convolutional network to effectively model the sequential signal characteristics, and introduce a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively weight informative signal segments, significantly enhancing identification performance. Additionally, the branch network allows leveraging pre-trained weights from other data while reducing the need for auxiliary datasets. Ablation experiments on the simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model. An accuracy comparison on a public dataset reveals that our method achieves 96% accuracy using only 10 symbols without requiring any prior knowledge."}

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."}
