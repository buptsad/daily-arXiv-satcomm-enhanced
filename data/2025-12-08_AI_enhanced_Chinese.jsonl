This scarcity introduces epistemic uncertainty, i.e., reducible uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the underlying data distribution, which fundamentally limits predictive performance. This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data. Throughout, we take an information-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role of information measures in quantifying the impact of data scarcity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels which are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90% when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6765\u63d0\u53474x4 MIMO\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u5728\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u67656G\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5929\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684MIMO\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5929\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfMIMO\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c4x4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5929\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u591a\u8fbe12 bit/s/Hz\uff0c\u6216\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea690%\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u50cf\u7d20\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5149\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u67656G\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Accepted at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2025, Proceedings of the Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Masked autoencoders (MAEs) are increasingly applied to electronic health records (EHR) for learning general-purpose representations that support diverse clinical tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565 CV-Masking\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9 EHR \u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c volatility-aware \u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u503c\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u968f\u673a\u6216\u65b9\u5dee\u57fa\u7840\u63a9\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u9879\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684 MAE \u5728 EHR \u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u7136\u800c\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5728\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6ce2\u52a8\u5267\u70c8\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e14\u4e0e\u6025\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CV-Masking\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\uff08Coefficient of Variation, CV\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u88ab\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u4ec5\u503c\uff08value-only\uff09\u63a9\u7801\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u677f\u4e0a\uff0cCV-Masking \u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u610f\u4e49\u7684 EHR \u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 MAE \u5728 EHR \u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002CV-Masking \u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

For this nominal system, a stabilizing law is derived from an offline dataset that has been acquired from the plant during experiments, such that the system states exponentially converge to a subspace.

Conventional GCC methods often suffer from performance degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, particularly when the signal bandwidth is unknown. GCC-MSIF introduces a \"mean signal\" estimated from multi-channel inputs and an \"inverse filter\" to virtually reconstruct the source signal, enabling adaptive suppression of out-of-band noise. Numerical simulations simulating a small-scale array demonstrate that GCC-MSIF significantly outperforms conventional methods, such as GCC-PHAT and GCC-SCOT, in low SNR regions and achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding the maximum likelihood (GCC-ML) method. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy improves scalably with the number of array elements.

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd/\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u5177\u666e\u904d\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528 transformer \u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6d88\u878d\uff08ablation\uff09\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u51bb\u7ed3 vs \u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u5927\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6ca1\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u518d\u5165\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdc\u8d85\u5176\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u624b\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u5b9a\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a hybrid modeling approach that integrates the gray-box model with a model for unmeasured disturbance. After reviewing several system identification approaches, we systematically designed the unmeasured disturbance model with a model selection process based on statistical tests to make it robust.

However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off.\n  We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed \"privacy-sanitizing\", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed \"utility-boosting\", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks.

Our framework integrates a broad collection of 19 attack methods (including one self-developed method), 29 defense methods, and 19 evaluation methods (including one self-developed method). With a curated attack corpus of 342 samples spanning 12 distinct risk categories, the TeleAI-Safety benchmark conducts extensive evaluations across 14 target models. The results reveal systematic vulnerabilities and model-specific failure cases, highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and utility, and identifying potential defense patterns for future optimization. In practical scenarios, TeleAI-Safety can be flexibly adjusted with customized attack, defense, and evaluation combinations to meet specific demands. We release our complete code and evaluation results to facilitate reproducible research and establish unified safety baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleAI-Safety \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8986\u76d619\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u300129\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u300119\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6837\u672c342\u6761\uff0c\u8986\u76d612\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9488\u5bf914\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5bf9LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u653b\u51fb/\u9632\u5fa1/\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0 TeleAI-Safety \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6574\u540819\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5176\u4e2d1\u79cd\u81ea\u7814\uff09\u300129\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u300119\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5176\u4e2d1\u79cd\u81ea\u7814\uff09\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b342\u6761\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8986\u76d612\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b\u5bf914\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6309\u9700\u7ec4\u5408\u653b\u51fb/\u9632\u5fa1/\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9632\u5fa1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleAI-Safety \u4e3aLLM\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

By enabling interconnections between RIS elements, BD-RIS architectures offer greater flexibility in wave manipulation compared to traditional diagonal RIS designs. However, these interconnections introduce new research challenges for channel estimation, making existing approaches developed for conventional diagonal RISs ineffective and significantly increasing pilot overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individual channel estimation framework that separately estimates the BS-RIS channel, which typically remains static over time, and the RIS-user channels, which vary rapidly due to user mobility. Specifically, we develop a full-duplex (FD) approach to estimate the BS-RIS channel by leveraging its inherent sparsity. Following this, the RIS-user channels are estimated using a least squares (LS) approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly higher channel estimation accuracy, particularly when the number of RIS elements is large, while substantially reducing pilot overhead compared to conventional cascaded channel estimation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u5bf9\u89d2BD-RIS\u7684\u9010\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06BS-RIS\u901a\u9053\u4e0eRIS-\u7528\u6237\u901a\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u53cc\u5de5(BD-RIS)\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8fdb\u884cBS-RIS\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0cRIS-\u7528\u6237\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "BD-RIS\u901a\u8fc7\u5728RIS\u5355\u5143\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e92\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u89d2\u9635\u5217\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4e92\u8fde\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8026\u5408\u4f7f\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709Diagonal RIS\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14\u98de\u884c\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9010\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6784\u5efa\u5168\u53cc\u5de5(FD)\u4f30\u8ba1BS-RIS\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u901a\u5e38\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u9759\u6001\u4e14\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58(LS)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1RIS-\u7528\u6237\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728RIS\u5355\u5143\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea7\u8054\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4epilot\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eBD-RIS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9010\u901a\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aBD-RIS\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions.

Assuming the parameters only enter the linear terms of the cost functions and constraint right-hand sides, we provide the exact multiparametric solution of the GNE problem. Such a solution enables (i) minimal real-time computation, (ii) inherent interpretability, explainability, and exact enumeration of all multiple equilibria, (iii) determine desired GNE solution types in the case of infinitely-many equilibria, and (iv) zero-shot updates of the GNE solution due to changes of constraint right-hand sides and/or linear costs. In line with explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches, we apply our method to solve game-theoretic MPC (Receding Horizon Games) explicitly, comparing performance against centralized solvers in a battery charging game and in a toy two-mass spring system control problem.

In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \\enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the \"deep\" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability \"harmful\" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability \"refusal\" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the \"gaming\" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO).

To address these limitations, this paper presents a contactless and non-invasive in-vivo monitoring system based on a low-power 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed system enables simultaneous detection of rodent activity and vital signs directly within home-cage environments, eliminating the need for implants, electrodes, or human intervention. The hardware platform leverages a compact Infineon BGT60 series radar sensor, optimized for low power consumption and continuous operation. We investigate sensor placement strategies and design a complete signal processing pipeline, including range bin selection, phase extraction, and frequency-domain estimation tailored to rodent vital signs. The system achieves 3 cm and 0.1 m/s sensitivity for motion and activity detection, while allowing discrimination of micro-movements associated with cardiopulmonary activity with a 2 um distance resolution. Experimental validation with two rodents in realistic in-vivo cages demonstrates that the radar can track animal position and extract respiration rates with 2 bpm accuracy.

We further analyze the robustness of the closed-loop system with respect to either multiplicative noise (vanishing at the origin) or additive noise (persistent). Effective LMI conditions are provided for specifying the minimal observer dimension and maximal Lipschitz constants that preserve the stability (mean-square exponential stability for multiplicative noise and noise-to-state stability for additive noise).

We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping.

Under such limited information, ensuring robust or classical quantitative safety over finite or infinite horizons is generally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven framework that provides theoretical one-step safety guarantees in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sense. This one-step guarantee can be applied recursively at each time step, thereby yielding step-by-step safety assurances over extended horizons. Our approach formulates barrier certificate conditions based solely on sampled data and establishes PAC safety guarantees by leveraging the VC dimension, scenario approaches, Markov's inequality, and Hoeffding's inequality. Two sampling procedures are proposed, and three methods are proposed to derive PAC safety guarantees. The properties and comparative advantages of these three methods are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several numerical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u7684 PAC \u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u66f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u4ec5\u6709\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6216\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020 barrier certificate \u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 VC \u7ef4\u3001\u60c5\u666f\u6cd5\u3001Markov \u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e0e Hoeffding \u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u5bfc PAC \u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65 PAC \u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3a barrier certificate \u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing defenses, designed primarily for text-only LLMs, are unsuitable for countering these multimodal threats, as they are easily bypassed, modality-dependent, or generalize poorly. Inspired by activation steering researches, we hypothesize that a robust, general defense independent of modality can be achieved by steering the model's behavior in the representation space. Through extensive experiments, we discover that the instruction-following behavior of MLLMs is encoded in a subspace. Steering along directions within this subspace can enforce adherence to user instructions, forming the basis of a defense. However, we also found that a naive defense direction could be coupled with a utility-degrading direction, and excessive intervention strength harms model performance. To address this, we propose ARGUS, which searches for an optimal defense direction within the safety subspace that decouples from the utility degradation direction, further combining adaptive strength steering to achieve a better safety-utility trade-off. ARGUS also introduces lightweight injection detection stage to activate the defense on-demand, and a post-filtering stage to verify defense success. Experimental results show that ARGUS can achieve robust defense against multimodal IPI while maximally preserving the MLLM's utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ARGUS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001IPI\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u6cbf\u7740\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u9075\u5faa\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u540e\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u9700\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u5230 multimodal Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) \u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u5e38\u88ab\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6216\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u884c\u4e3a\u6240\u5904\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4e0b\u964d\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u529b\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5b89\u5168-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u6309\u9700\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u6ee4/\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u9632\u5fa1\u662f\u5426\u751f\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a ARGUS \u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001IPI\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c3d\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559MLLM\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u540e\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient unlearning framework that reduces the size of datasets before unlearning leading to significant computational savings (up to approximately 50 percent) on real world empirical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u751a\u5fae\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\u540e\u518d\u6267\u884cunlearning\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea650%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u201c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u201d\u3002\u73b0\u6709unlearning\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5fd8\u8bb0\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u70b9\u540c\u7b49\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u82e5\u67d0\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5fc5\u9010\u4e00\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548unlearning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728unlearning\u524d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f85\u5904\u7406\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4unlearning\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea650%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6570\u636e\u88c1\u526a\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

This paper formulates the noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization problem that factorizes the joint likelihood of primary and supervisory measurements to reconcile information exploitation with computational tractability. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian dependency into a Markov-chain structure, allowing efficient computation. At the lower level, a Kalman filter with state augmentation performs such computation. Meanwhile, closed-form forward and reverse differentiation provide efficient gradients for the upper-level updates, and we compare the two models' space and time complexities to inform their practical selection. The upper level subsequently refines the noise covariances to guide the lower-level estimation.

However, existing real-time filtering algorithms struggle to maintain accurate waypoints under measurement noise in nonlinear and time-varying systems, posing risks of flight instability and missed wildfire detections during UAV-based terrain following. To address this issue, a Residual Variance Matching Recursive Least Squares (RVM-RLS) filter, guided by a Residual Variance Matching Estimation (RVME) criterion, is proposed to adaptively estimate the real-time waypoints of nonlinear, time-varying UAV-based terrain following systems. The proposed method is validated using a UAV-based online terrain following system within a simulated terrain environment. Experimental results show that the RVM-RLS filter improves waypoints estimation accuracy by approximately 88$\\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics.

Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. Theoretically, we derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term. Empirical results on three standard continuous-control environments show that our algorithm achieves efficiency, stability, and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa RSA2C\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26 SHAP \u72b6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6838\u5316\u4e24\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6 Actor-Critic\uff0c\u5229\u7528 RKHS \u4e0e Mahalanobis \u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u4ee5\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u91cf\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 RSA2C\uff1aActor \u5728\u5411\u91cf\u503c RKHS\u3001Value/Advantage Critic \u5728\u6807\u91cf RKHS\uff1b\u91c7\u7528 Mahalanobis \u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6838\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u72b6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u7531 RKHS-SHAP \u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u95e8\u63a7\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8c03\u8282 Actor \u68af\u5ea6\u548c Advantage \u76ee\u6807\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u754c\u53ca\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RSA2C \u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u6838\u5316\u4e24\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6 Actor-Critic \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u72b6\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Since informative experiments are costly, input signals must be selected to maximize information content based on the currently available model. To improve the extrapolation properties of the identified model, we introduce a manifold-regularization strategy that enforces smooth variations in the qLPV dynamics, promoting Linear Time-Varying (LTV) behavior. Using this regularized structure, we propose a new active learning criterion based on path integrals of an inverse-distance variance measure and derive an efficient approximation exploiting the LTV smoothness.

Unlike conventional synchronization strategies that require continuous transmission of full-state data packets, our approach utilizes a bio-inspired neuromorphic amplifier to achieve practical synchronization via intermittent, 1-bit Dirac delta pulses. The proposed method drastically improves communication efficiency in terms of bandwidth and energy by minimizing the information payload to a single bit, with intermittent and asynchronous communication. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method and validate the proposed scheme through numerical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u8109\u51b2\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u91c7\u75281\u6bd4\u7279Dirac\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u653e\u5927\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fde\u7eed\u4f20\u8f93\u5b8c\u6574\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5236\u3002\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u901a\u4fe1\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u653e\u5927\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u795e\u7ecf\u8109\u51b2\u901a\u4fe1\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u653e\u5927\u5668\u901a\u8fc71-bit Dirac\u8109\u51b2\u8fdb\u884c\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u6b65\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u964d\u81f3\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8109\u51b2\u540c\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u540c\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper proposes Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning (LA-RL) with Safety Guarantees, a novel framework that integrates the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into the actor-critic architecture with an improved safety layer. Within this framework, task-specific reward shaping harmonizes the dual objectives of maximizing driving efficiency and ensuring safety, guiding decision-making based on both environmental insights and clearly defined goals. To enhance safety, LA-RL incorporates a safety-critical planner that combines model predictive control (MPC) with discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs). This layer formally constrains the LLM-informed policy to a safe action set, employs a slack mechanism that enhances solution feasibility, prevents overly conservative behavior and allows for greater policy exploration without compromising safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptive, reliable, and robust solution for autonomous highway driving. Compared to existing SOTA, it achieves approximately 20$\\%$ higher success rate than the knowledge graph (KG) based baseline and about 30$\\%$ higher than the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based baseline. In low-density environments, LA-RL achieves a 100$\\%$ success rate.

However, the learning objectives and update dynamics of the Actor and Critic differ, raising concerns about whether uniform transition usage is optimal.\n  Objectives: We aim to improve the performance of deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms by decoupling the transition batches used to train the Actor and the Critic. Our goal is to design an experience replay mechanism that provides appropriate learning signals to each component by using separate, tailored batches.\n  Methods: We introduce Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay (DPER), a novel approach that allows independent sampling of transition batches for the Actor and the Critic.

However, the lack of physical meaning of impedance and admittance matrices hinders the ability to understand the root cause of instabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of Pauli decomposition to the impedance matrices and the minor loop of grid-connected power electronic converters. The application of this methodology simplifies establishing the link between impedance matrix terms and closed-loop stability properties. Moreover, Pauli decomposition transforms impedance matrices in a quaternion-like form that is helpful to assess the root cause of instabilities. The theoretical contributions are validated using a case study consisting of a power electronic converter connected to a weak grid that has been previously analysed in the literature using existing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa RG-SAGA \u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u91cf\u8861\u91cf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e inexact composite gradient \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5 SAGA \u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Recursive-Gradient \u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u610f\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u5c06\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e SAGA \u5f97\u5230 RG-SAGA\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u901a\u8baf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1bRG-SAGA \u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb SAGA \u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e RG-SAGA \u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u4e5f\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Physiological variability further complicates insulin requirements, underscoring the need for controllers that adapt dynamically and reduce user burden.

The controller integrates basal insulin infusion with the insulin bolus delivery module for meal-related and corrective bolus dosing, adapting bounds in real time to glucose dynamics while accounting for both automated and user-initiated inputs. In-silico evaluation was conducted using the commercial version of the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova metabolic simulator across nine scenarios involving persistent and time-varying errors in meal timing, carbohydrate estimation, and basal insulin profiles. Results: In the baseline scenario, UniBE achieved a mean time in range of 92.0+-13.2%, with time below range at 0.1+-0.2% and time above range at 7.9+-13.2%.

The discrete-time dynamic evolution of each cognitive state is modeled using a first-order affine difference equation. Reliance is defined as a single discrete-valued state, whose evolution at each time step depends on the cognitive states satisfying certain threshold conditions. Using data collected from 16 participants, we estimate participant-specific model parameters based on their reliance on the automation and intermittently self-reported cognitive states during a continuous drive in a vehicle simulator. The model can be estimated using a single user's trajectory data (e.g. 8 minutes of driving), making it suitable for online parameter adaptation methods. Our results show that the model fits the observed trajectories well for several participants, with their reliance behavior primarily influenced by trust, perceived risk, or both. Importantly, the model is interpretable, such that the variations in model parameters across participants provide insights into differences in the time scales over which cognitive states evolve, and how these states are influenced by task complexity.

Yet, ensuring their reliability remains a critical challenge, as existing LLMs trained on massive heterogeneous datasets often exhibit problematic memorization of proprietary intellectual property (IP), contaminated benchmarks, and unsafe coding patterns. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes.

Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstructMPC\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eMPC\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff08\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u540e\u6094\u754c\u4e3aO(\u221aT log T)\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6e17\u900f\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u9700\u5bf9\u975e\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5177\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u7ef4\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u7ef4\u62a4\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8d1f\u8377\u7a81\u589e\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInstructMPC\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Contextual Disturbances Predictor (CDP) \u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u878d\u5165MPC\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u53c2\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u672c\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u6094\u754c(O(\u221aT log T))\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u7ed9\u51fa\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u540e\u6094\u754c\u4e3aO(\u221aT log T)\u7684\u4fdd\u8b49\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u5c06LLMs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eMPC\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CDP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u6270\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8f6c\u8bd1\u3002", "conclusion": "InstructMPC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u7535\u7f51\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u6094\u754c\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

This structure implies that the configuration-tracking error evolves exactly linearly in the associated Lie algebra coordinates (log-linear dynamics), rather than arising from a local linearization of the nonlinear system. As a result, a broad class of linear analysis and synthesis tools becomes directly applicable to powered spacecraft motion on SE2(3). A simple numerical example confirms that the error predicted by the linear Lie-algebra dynamics matches the error computed from the full nonlinear system, illustrating the exact log-linear behavior. This foundational property opens a path toward rigorous tools for satellite docking, autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations, robust controller design, and convex safety certification-capabilities that are difficult to achieve with classical local linearizations such as Tschauner-Hempel/Yamanaka-Ankersen (TH/YA).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728SE2(3)\u96c6\u56e2\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u529b\u821e\u661f\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4eff\u5c04\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\uff08log-linear\uff09\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790/\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u76f4\u63a5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u7a7a\u98de\u884c\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6b64\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5bf9\u63a5\u3001 rendezvous \u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eTH/YA\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u592a\u7a7a\u98de\u884c\u5668\u5728\u8fd1\u7aef\u8f68\u9053\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u96be\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\uff08\u5982TH/YA\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u4ec5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u9644\u8fd1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u51f8\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a8\u529b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5199\u6210SE2(3)\u4e0a\u7684\u7fa4\u4eff\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u5728\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff08log-linear\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5168\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u6027\u8d28\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u914d\u7f6e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u6309\u7167\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790/\u5408\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5168\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u8be5\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u8d28\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u5bf9\u63a5\u3001\u81ea\u6cbb rendezvous\u3001\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e1a\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u51f8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eTH/YA\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u822a\u5929\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5d4c\u5165SE2(3)\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0log-linear\u8bef\u5dee dynamics \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7ebf\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u51f8\u5b89\u5168\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6587\u672c token \u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u8db3\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u6742\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u6027\uff08positivity\uff09\u8fdd\u80cc\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u8c03\u6574\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u503e\u5411\u5206\u6570\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u5dee\u589e\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8db3\u591f\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\uff08unconfoundedness\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u7f13\u89e3 positivity \u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002", "method": "CATR \u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u8bca\u65ad\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u7684 token \u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u63a7\u5236\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8be5\u5b50\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u56e0\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e MIMIC-III \u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCATR \u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CATR \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u7f13\u89e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c42\u9762\u7684 positivity \u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u9009\u53d6\u4e0e\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4ecd\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO).

While many scoring functions perform well on standard benchmarks, their ability to generalize beyond training data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we evaluate the generalization capability of state-of-the-art scoring functions on dataset splits that simulate evaluation on targets with a limited number of known structures and experimental affinity measurements. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets. We also investigate whether large-scale self-supervised pretraining can bridge this generalization gap and we provide preliminary evidence of its potential. Furthermore, we probe the efficacy of simple methods that leverage limited test-target data to improve scoring function performance. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous evaluation protocols and offer practical guidance for designing scoring functions with predictive power extending to novel protein targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u65b0\u9776\u6807\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u65b0\u9776\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u53ea\u6709\u6709\u9650\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9776\u6807\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9776\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u666e\u9002\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5212\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u9776\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9776\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u672a\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u65b0\u9776\u6807\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9776\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc1\u636e\u4ecd\u4e3a\u521d\u6b65\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u65b0\u9776\u6807\u7684\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u65b0\u9776\u6807\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u9776\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u4e5f\u5177\u5907\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations.

These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer.

In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied.

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ensemble \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u589e\u76ca\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1a\u7ebf\u6027/\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027/\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6811\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea65\u20137\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c0f\u4e8e3%\uff1b\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u5f3a\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u9632\u62df\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u4e5d\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 Breast Cancer\u3001Heart Disease\u3001Pima Diabetes \u4e0e Credit Card Fraud \u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3001Fisher \u6bd4\u7387\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4f55\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7ecf\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6811\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea65\u20137\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u4fdd\u6301\u57283%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff1b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5927\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5f15\uff1a\u53ea\u8981\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u6613\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u5728\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u4e14\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift.

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape.

First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths.

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling.

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Modular Jets\uff08MoJet\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027 jets \u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u201c\u6d77\u5e02\u8703\u697c\uff08mirage\uff09\u201d\u548c\u201c\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\uff08identifiable\uff09\u201d\u60c5\u5f62\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e jet \u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa MoJet \u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ebf\u6027/\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5426\u552f\u4e00\u51b3\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u5185\u90e8\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027 jets\uff1a\u5728\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5f15\u5165 mirage \u4e0e identifiable \u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684 jet \u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5b9a\u7406\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa MoJet \u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1 jets \u5e76\u8fdb\u884c mirage \u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728 mild \u7684\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5bf9\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7 jets \u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u53ef\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf mirage \u5206\u89e3\u3002MoJet \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1 jets \u5e76\u8fdb\u884c mirage \u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u652f\u6301\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e ML \u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u90e8\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u7684 MoJet \u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u8fa8\u8bc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSelective Gradient Masking\uff08SGTM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u53ef\u505c\u6b62\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u7684Gradient Routing\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7528\u9014\u98ce\u9669\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8bef\u6807\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u89e3\u9664\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGTM\uff0c\u5728\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u96f6\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u793a\u4f8b\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u4e13\u7528\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u4ece\u53cc\u8bed\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u4ece\u82f1\u8bed\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0cSGTM\u5728\u4fdd\u7559/\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548cGradient Routing\u7684\u5148\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u4e03\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u6570\u65b9\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5fd8\u8bb0\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5RMU\u3002", "conclusion": "SGTM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168 mitigations \u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development.

In current practice, analog beamforming uses a codebook of pre-configured beams with each of them radiating towards a specific direction, and a beam management function continuously selects \\textit{optimal} beams for moving user equipments (UEs). However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself.

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($\u03b1$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e32\u8054\u8d77\u95e8\u63a7\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u79ef\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3H_N\uff1b\u4ec5\u4ec5\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7684\u786e\u5207\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7531\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u6ede\u548c\u5355\u5143\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03bc_{t,\u2113}\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u7a33\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6ede\u540e\u2113\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u91cfN(\u2113)\u4e0ef(\u2113)^{-\u03b1}\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2df(\u2113)=||\u03bc_{t,\u2113}||_1\uff1b\u7ed9\u51faH_N\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u53caf(\u2113)\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u3001\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3001\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684\u95e8\u8c31\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u8d8a\u5927\uff0cf(\u2113)\u8870\u51cf\u8d8a\u6162\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\u8d8a\u5927\uff1b\u800c\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u538b\u7f29H_N\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u95e8\u63a7RNN\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8Jacobian\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed9\u51faH_N\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u4ee5BPTT\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95e8\u63a7\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u79ef\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03bc_{t,\u2113}\uff1b\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u03b1-\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5728\u6ede\u540e\u2113\u5904\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4f9d\u8d56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cfN(\u2113)\u221df(\u2113)^{-\u03b1}\uff0c\u5176\u4e2df(\u2113)=||\u03bc_{t,\u2113}||_1\uff1b\u5f97\u5230H_N\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53caf(\u2113)\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u3001\u5e42\u6b21\u548c\u6307\u6570\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684\u95e8\u8c31\u5bf9f(\u2113)\u548cH_N\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51faH_N\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u4e0ef(\u2113)\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u95e8\u8c31\u8d8a\u5bbd\u3001\u8d8a\u5f02\u8d28\uff0cf(\u2113)\u8870\u51cf\u8d8a\u6162\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\u8d8a\u5927\uff1b\u8f83\u91cd\u7684\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u538b\u7f29H_N\uff1b\u5c06\u95e8\u63a7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u03bc_{t,\u2113}\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u89c6\u4e3a\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u95e8\u63a7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7RNN\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency.

In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution.

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data.

To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers. We introduce MaxShapley, an efficient algorithm for fair attribution in generative search pipelines that use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "MaxShapley is an efficient Shapley-based attribution method for RAG in generative search, enabling linear-time attribution in the number of documents and achieving similar quality to exact Shapley with far lower resource use (up to 8x cheaper).", "motivation": "Generative LLM-based search changes how content providers are compensated; exact Shapley attribution is computationally intractable for large retrieval sets, necessitating scalable fair attribution mechanisms.", "method": "Introduce MaxShapley, a special case of Shapley value using a decomposable max-sum utility function.

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u03b1-\u53d1\u6563\uff08\u03b1-divergence\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u6a21\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\uff08mode-seeking\uff09\u5411\u8986\u76d6\u6027\uff08mass-covering\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8986\u76d6-\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u8c03\u4f18LLMs\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8eRL\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u201c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5316\u5bfb\u4f18/\u96f6\u8feb\u4f7f\u201d\u9006KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5927\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u805a\u7126\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u533a\u57df\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u5e76\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff1a\u53ea\u7b5b\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1-\u53d1\u6563\u5bb6\u65cf\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u8986\u76d6-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u72b6\u6001-\u827a\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u524d\u4eba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8986\u76d6-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8986\u76d6\uff08coverage\uff09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03b1-\u53d1\u6563\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u4ece\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u51fa\u53d1\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u03b1-\u53d1\u6563\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
