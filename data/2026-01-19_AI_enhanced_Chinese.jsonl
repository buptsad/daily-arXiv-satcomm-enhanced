Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $\u03c6^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65b0\u578b\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u5c04\u4e0e\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u63d0\u5347\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u5c04\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u6216\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u9006\u4e0e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u5c04\uff08\u7acb\u65b9\u578b\u6709\u7406\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u3001\u7acb\u65b9\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8026\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u79fb\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f84\u5411\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u5411\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u57281D/2D\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0eSpline\u7ade\u4e89\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f84\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001/1000\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u03c6\u2074\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eff\u5c04\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u4f18\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u584c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u6ed1\u53cc\u5c04\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUOWQ\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u6e90\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u9002\u5f53\u52a0\u6743\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u4f20\u8f93\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e24\u8005\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6e90\u76f4\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u5f02\u6784\u6e90\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faUOWQ\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u591a\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u5728DomainNet\u3001Office-Home\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "UOWQ\u5728DomainNet\u548cOffice-Home\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fde\u7eed\u9886\u5148\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6570\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff08UOWQ\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u6070\u5f53\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u6e90\u6837\u672c\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \\sim dm \\log_2m$ for $0 < r \\leq 1/4$ in the case of $\\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\\log m$ for all $0<r<1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $\u03a9((d-1)m \\log_2m)$ for $0 < r \\leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Drawing on Communication Privacy Management theory and Masur's horizontal (user-AI) and vertical (user-platform) privacy framework, we conducted in-depth interviews with fifteen users of companion AI platforms such as Replika and Character.AI. Our findings reveal that users blend interpersonal habits with institutional awareness: while the non-judgmental, always-available nature of chatbots fosters emotional safety and encourages self-disclosure, users remain mindful of institutional risks and actively manage privacy through layered strategies and selective sharing.

While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent \"zombie chargers\" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations.

The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups.

This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to signal bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences whose squared signal two-norm is bounded by a fixed budget. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, we derive a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy valid for arbitrary initial states. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex scalar optimization for the Lagrange multiplier at each stage; the control is then explicit. For fixed disturbance budget $\u03b1$, the state space partitions into two distinct regions: $\\mathcal{X}_L(\u03b1)$, where the optimal control policy is linear and coincides with the standard linear $H_{\\infty}$ state feedback control, and $\\mathcal{X}_{NL}(\u03b1)$, where the optimal control policy is nonlinear. We establish monotonicity and boundedness of the associated Riccati recursions and characterize the geometry of the solution regions.

Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention.

Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6539\u8fdbVLP\u6280\u672f\u81f3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f6f\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7eff\u8272\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u63a8\u51faMugi\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u541e\u5410\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6GEMM\u6548\u7387\u5df2\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5904\u7406LLM\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55VLP\u81f3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u503c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0GEMM\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u4ec5\u91cf\u5316\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u6784\u5efaMugi\u4f53\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "Mugi\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Softmax\u4e0a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf45\u500d\u3001\u80fd\u6548668\u500d\uff1b\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u54102.07\u500d\u3001\u80fd\u65483.11\u500d\uff1b\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u78b3\u6392\u653e1.45\u500d\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u78b31.48\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6f14\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u503c\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\uff08VLP\uff09\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u67b6\u6784Mugi\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we highlight the trade-offs between security measures and system performance, providing critical insights into optimizing security without unduly impacting operational efficiency.

Systems are classified as degenerate or nondegenerate based on steady-state solution properties. For nondegenerate systems, the finite horizon solution converges to the steady-state solution for all states as the horizon approaches infinity. For degenerate systems, convergence holds in one region of the state space, while a turnpike arises in the complementary region. When convergence holds, the optimal multiplier and control gain are obtained directly from the LMI solution.

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data.

Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case.

However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By combining game theory and dynamic programming, this work derives a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex optimization for the Lagrange multiplier vector at each stage; the control is then explicit. For systems with constant stage bound, the problem admits a steady-state optimization expressed as a tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of the solution.\n  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the StDAR for arbitrary initial states.

The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the AEDS, a data sequence $\\bm{s}=s_1s_2\\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \\cdots, 2,1$, while $\\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \\cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5AEDS\uff0c\u517c\u5177tANS\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cAEDS\u5728\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u4e0b\u80fd\u6bd4Huffman\u7801\u66f4\u77ed\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u71b5\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a$O(1/N)$\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edftANS\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u529b\u6c42\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u53cd\u5411\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u6b63\u5411\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\u8868\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bd4tANS\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9i.i.d.\u6e90\uff0cAEDS\u4e24\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u5728\u6839\u5b50\u6982\u7387>0.61803\u65f6\u53d6\u5f97\u6bd4Huffman\u66f4\u77ed\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\uff1b\u4e94\u72b6\u6001\u5728>0.56984\u65f6\u4ea6\u5982\u6b64\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0a\u754c\u548c$O(1/N)$\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AEDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06tANS\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u6811\u6982\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8eHuffman\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0etANS\u4e00\u6837\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u4ee5$O(1/N)$\u901f\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\u71b5\u3002"}}

Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling.

The challenge is even greater for complementary OFET circuits, where two PSCs must be patterned sequentially, which often leads to device degradation. Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the first stretchable complementary OTFT neuron circuit, where the output frequency is modulated by the input current to mimic neuronal signal processing. This scalable approach can be readily extended to diverse high-performance stretchable materials, accelerating the development and manufacturing of skin-like electronics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u5149\u523b\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u4f7f\u62c9\u4f38OFET\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u538b\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u62c9\u4f38\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f38\u5c55\u6709\u673a\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\uff08OFET\uff09\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u7535\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u827a\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\uff08PSC\uff09\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u827a\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u6613\u81f4\u8bbe\u5907\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u7535\u8def\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u4e24\u6b21\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6c89\u79ef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5355\u7247\u5149\u523b\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5149\u53ef\u523b\u3001\u6eb6\u5242\u8010\u53d7\u7684\u4ea4\u8054\u4ecb\u7535/\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u754c\u9762\uff1b2\uff09\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u4ea4\u8054PSC\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u523b\u8680\u63a9\u6a21\u548c\u5c01\u88c5\u7684\u63a9\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u827a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u6c34\u3001\u5355\u7247\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u62c9\u4f38\u4e92\u8865OFET\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u62c9\u4f38OTFT\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u96c6\u6210\u5bc6\u5ea655,000\u202fcm\u207b\u00b2\u3001\u901a\u9053\u957f\u5ea62\u202f\u03bcm\u3001\u4f4e\u538b5\u202fV\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u5b8c\u62103\u202fkHz\u62c9\u4f38\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff08\u9996\u6b21\u8d851\u202fkHz\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u73b0\u72b6\u63d0\u534760\u500d\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u9996\u4e2a\u62c9\u4f38\u4e92\u8865OTFT\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u7535\u6d41\u8c03\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5149\u523b\u5e73\u53f0\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u62c9\u4f38\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u76ae\u80a4\u5f0f\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u4e0e\u5236\u9020\u3002"}}

A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa Action Shapley \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u9009\u62e9\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0 80%% \u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u5371\u9669\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u504f\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Action Shapley \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u7edf Shapley \u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6307\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u53d7\u9650\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7 80%% \u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e Action Shapley \u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7a33\u5065\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Action Shapley \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Modern Industry 4.0 technologies, such as OPC UA, offer enhanced resilience against these threats. However, widespread adoption remains limited due to long installation times, proprietary technology, restricted flexibility, and formal process requirements (e.g. safety certifications). Consequently, many systems do not yet implement these technologies, or only partially. This leads to the challenge of dealing with so-called brownfield systems, which are often placed in isolated security zones to mitigate risks. However, the need for data exchange between secure and insecure zones persists.\n  This paper reviews existing solutions to address this challenge by analysing their approaches, advantages, and limitations. Building on these insights, we identify three key concepts, evaluate their suitability and compatibility, and ultimately introduce the SigmaServer, a novel TCP-level aggregation method. The developed proof-of-principle implementation is evaluated in an operational technology (OT) testbed, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in bridging secure and insecure zones.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 \u00b0C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance. This study contributes a practical methodology for optimizing TES charging temperatures in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems while maintaining indoor setpoint temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature. Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work aims to address this gap. We first formalize notions of a solution for such systems. We then provide conditions that guarantee the existence and forward completeness of solutions.

While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision.

A full order observer based feedback control framework is developed to estimate system states and compensate for external disturbances during the trajectory correction phase following main engine cut off. The maneuver trajectory is generated using Lambert guidance, while the observer based controller ensures accurate tracking of the target orbit despite SRP perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed design is assessed through stability, observability, and controllability analyses. Stability is validated by step-response simulations and eigenvalue distributions of the system dynamics. Observability is demonstrated through state matrix rank analysis, confirming complete state estimation. Controllability is verified using state feedback rank conditions and corresponding control performance plots. Comparative simulations highlight that, in contrast to uncontrolled or conventional control cases, the observer based controller achieves improved trajectory accuracy and robust disturbance rejection with moderate control effort.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline.

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u5929\u7ebf\u652f\u6301\u7684IRS\u534f\u52a9\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5929\u7ebf\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548cIRS\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u603b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u5929\u7ebf\u5728\u7269\u7406\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bIRS\u5728\u57fa\u7ad9\u526f\u74e3\u533a\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5e76\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff08PGA\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4e09\u7ef4\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u95ed\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u63a5\u6536\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff08FP\uff09\u4f18\u5316IRS\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff08AO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7684\u603b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

In this context, a Root of Trust (RoT) establishes a trusted environment, where both data and code are authenticated via a digital signature based on asymmetric cryptography, which is vulnerable to the threat posed by Quantum Computers (QCs). Firmware, being the first layer of trusted software, faces unique risks due to its longevity and difficult update. The transition of firmware protection to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is urgent, since it reduces the risk derived from exposing all computing and network devices to quantum-based attacks. This paper offers an analysis of the most common trust techniques and their roadmap towards a Post-Quantum (PQ) world, by investigating the current status of PQC and the challenges posed by such algorithms in existing Trusted Computing (TC) solutions from an integration perspective.

Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u53bb\u566a+\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a+\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a+\u9ad8\u6548Shuffle+\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u2014\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6700\u4f73\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6eda\u52a8\u8f74\u627f\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784LSR-Net\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53bb\u566a+\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff08DFEM\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u53bb\u566a\u5757\uff08DM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u7ec4\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u70b9\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u901a\u9053\u62c6\u5206\u7684\u9ad8\u6548Shuffle\u5757\uff08CES\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u6d17\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u632f\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLSR-Net\u5728\u6297\u566a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8fd0\u7b97\u91cf\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "LSR-Net\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6eda\u52a8\u8f74\u627f\u7f3a\u9677\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data.

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima.

This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "MGF-RL\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8d1f\u8377\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RL\u4e0eMPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\u6062\u590d\u5173\u952e\u8d1f\u8377\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f7f\u6062\u590d\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u4f20\u7edfRL\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e00\u9636\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5143\u6307\u5bfc\u9057\u4f20\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(MGF-RL)\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u505c\u7535\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u5206\u5e03\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 13-bus\u548c123-bus\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cMGF-RL\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RL\u3001MAML-based\u5143RL\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u505c\u7535\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\uff0cMGF-RL\u6240\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u8f6e\u6b21\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u540e\u6094\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "MGF-RL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u9ad8\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u914d\u6bd4\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8377\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Addressing the resulting trust deadlock between IP vendors and system integrators without exposing proprietary designs requires novel privacy-preserving verification techniques. However, existing privacy-preserving hardware verification methods are all simulation-based and fail to offer formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose ZK-CEC, the first privacy-preserving framework for hardware formal verification. By combining formal verification and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), ZK-CEC establishes a foundation for formally verifying IP correctness and security without compromising the confidentiality of the designs.\n  We observe that existing zero-knowledge protocols for formal verification are designed to prove statements of public formulas. However, in a privacy-preserving verification context where the formula is secret, these protocols cannot prevent a malicious prover from forging the formula, thereby compromising the soundness of the verification. To address these gaps, we first propose a blueprint for proving the unsatisfiability of a secret design against a public constraint, which is widely applicable to proving properties in software, hardware, and cyber-physical systems. Based on the proposed blueprint, we construct ZK-CEC, which enables a prover to convince the verifier that a secret IP's functionality aligns perfectly with the public specification in zero knowledge, revealing only the length and width of the proof. We implement ZK-CEC and evaluate its performance across various circuits, including arithmetic units and cryptographic components.

Preprint", "summary": "We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark.

Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval.

The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system.

Most existing AI-based physical-layer designs rely on task-specific models that are separately tailored to individual modules, resulting in poor generalization. In contrast, communication systems are inherently general-purpose and should support broad applicability and robustness across diverse scenarios. Foundation models offer a promising solution through strong reasoning and generalization, yet wireless-system constraints hinder a direct transfer of large language model (LLM)-style success to the wireless domain. Therefore, we introduce the concept of large wireless foundation models (LWFMs) and present a novel framework for empowering the physical layer with foundation models under wireless constraints. Specifically, we propose two paradigms for realizing LWFMs, including leveraging existing general-purpose foundation models and building novel wireless foundation models. Based on recent progress, we distill two roadmaps for each paradigm and formulate design principles under wireless constraints. We further provide case studies of LWFM-empowered wireless systems to intuitively validate their advantages.

We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC.

Currently, accurate Wi-Fi tracking methods rely primarily on fine-grained velocity features. However, such velocity-based approaches suffer from the problem of accumulative errors, making it challenging to stably track users' trajectories over a long period of time. This paper presents DuTrack, a fusion-based tracking system for stable human tracking. The fundamental idea is to leverage the ubiquitous acoustic signals in households to rectify the accumulative Wi-Fi tracking error. Theoretically, Wi-Fi sensing in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios can be modeled as elliptical Fresnel zones and hyperbolic zones, respectively. By designing acoustic sensing signals, we are able to model the acoustic sensing zones as a series of hyperbolic clusters. We reveal how to fuse the fields of electromagnetic waves and mechanical waves, and establish the optimization equation. Next, we design a data-driven architecture to solve the aforementioned optimization equation. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal tracking scheme exhibits superior performance.

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLc-RF\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e0eRBMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8f66\u8f86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVFC\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56RF\uff0c\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7a20\u5bc6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9002\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1bVLC\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e72\u6270\u6297\u5e72\u6270\uff0cRF\u63d0\u4f9b\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u5212\u5206\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VLC\u548cRF\u94fe\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u5229\u7528RBMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u4f18\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8ba4\u4e3a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4ec5VLC\u6216\u4ec5RF\u7684VFC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548cRBMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747TPD\u4e0b\u964d15%", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f02\u8d28\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1-VLC-RF\u67b6\u6784\u548cRBMM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea615%"}}

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents InterPUF, a compact and scalable authentication framework that transforms the interposer into a distributed root of trust. InterPUF embeds a route-based differential delay physically unclonable function (PUF) across the reconfigurable interconnect and secures authentication using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring raw PUF signatures are never exposed. Our hardware evaluation shows only 0.23% area and 0.072% power overhead across diverse chiplets while preserving authentication latency within tens of nanoseconds.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link.

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs.

This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development.

Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format.

The source code is available at https://github.com/MDI-TokyoTech/Comprehensive-Robust-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition. The project page is https://www.mdi.c.titech.ac.jp/publications/cr-dmd", "summary": "We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DP-SFT\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ea\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\u52a0\u566a\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "DP-SFT\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\uff1a\u2460\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u2461\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u540e\u6ce8\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u518d\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfDP\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06DP\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5b9a\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u5f0fDP\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The RISs employ a delay line architecture (DLA) that decouples the phase shifting and radiating layer, enabling wide bandwidth, continuous phase control exceeding 360\u00b0, and fast response times with a micrometer-thin LC layer of 4.6 micrometer. Two prototypes with 120 and 750 elements are realized using identical unit cells and column-wise biasing. Measurements demonstrate beam steering over +-60\u00b0 and -3 dB bandwidths exceeding 9% for both apertures, confirming the scalability of the proposed architecture. On top of a measured nanowatt power consumption per unit cell, aperture efficiencies above 20% are predicted by simulations. While the measured efficiencies are reduced to 9.2% and 2.6%, a detailed analysis verifies that this reduction can be attributed to technological challenges in a laboratory environment.

In the reaction-limited regime, we derive a closed-form single-pulse response kernel and a symbol-rate recursion for on-off keying that explicitly exposes channel memory and inter-symbol interference. We further develop short-pulse and long-pulse approximations, revealing an interference asymmetry in the long-pulse regime due to saturation. To account for stochasticity, we adopt a finite-receptor binomial counting model, employ pulse-end sampling, and propose a low-complexity midpoint-threshold detector that reduces to a fixed threshold when interference is negligible. Numerical results corroborate the proposed characterization and quantify detection performance versus pulse and symbol durations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u5438\u9644\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5fae\u6d41\u4f53\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u4f53\u7684\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8ba1\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2d\u70b9\u9608\u503c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u6d41\u4f53\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cfLangmuir\u5438\u9644\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u9053\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u53d7\u9650 regime \u4e0b\u5bfc\u51fa\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u6838\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e on\u2011off keying \u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u7387\u9012\u63a8\u516c\u5f0f\uff1b\u5236\u5b9a\u77ed\u8109\u51b2/\u957f\u8109\u51b2\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u53d7\u4f53\u4e8c\u9879\u8ba1\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8109\u51b2\u672b\u7aef\u53d6\u6837\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e2d\u70b9\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u901a\u9053\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ca ISI \u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u957f\u8109\u51b2 regime \u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u9971\u548c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8131\u5374\u8109\u51b2\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u53d7 Langmuir \u5438\u9644\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5fae\u6d41\u4f53\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u63a5\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u5e76\u914d\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9608\u503c+\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ea6\uff0c\u53c8\u5c06LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u91cf\u964d\u81f3\u539f\u672c\u76841/20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6216LLM\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5229\u7528LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u51c6\u7ea6\u675f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u2460\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u751f\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u91cf\uff1b\u2461\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u7ea6\u675f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9608\u503c\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u51c6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc720\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e1a\u754c\u6700\u4f73\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6240\u9700LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u51c6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms.

A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties.

Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete.

Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $\u03ba$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $\u03ba$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt\u03ba m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrt\u03ba$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(\u03ba^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $\u03ba^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability.

However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ.

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "SDFLoRA splits adapters into shared and private parts; aggregates only shared part; adds DP noise there; outperforms baselines on GLUE.", "motivation": "Federated learning on large language models faces rank heterogeneity due to differing low\u2011rank configurations across clients, making aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable.", "method": "Propose Selective Dual\u2011module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA) that splits each client adapter into a shared global module (aggregate\u2011able) and a private local module.

We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points.

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift.

We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks.

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging.

The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $j\u03ba$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $j\u03ba$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u5374\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff08FID\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u548c\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0e\u6307\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5173\u6ce8\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u5e94\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff08Deep Ensembles\u3001Monte Carlo Dropout\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08FID\uff09\u5728CIFAR\u201110\u4e0eFFHQ\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u68c0\u9a8c\u805a\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u548c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684FID\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u548c\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6253\u5305\uff08ensemble\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5982FID\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff08Deep Ensembles\u3001Monte Carlo Dropout\uff09\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0eFFHQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5927\u81f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u989d\u5916\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u4e00\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u5bfc\uff08guidance\uff09\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization.

In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06CMOS Ising \u673a\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCPU/GPU\u7684\u6458\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684Ising\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u573a\u91cf\u4e0e\u8026\u5408\u9879\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6458\u8981\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u968f\u673a\u56db\u820d\u4e94\u5165\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u8865\u507f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff1b3\uff09\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6458\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728COBI\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "result": "\u5728CNN/DailyMail\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCOBI\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6Tabu\u641c\u7d22\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed3-4.5\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u5230\u4e09\u9636\uff1b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u529f\u8017CMOS\u8026\u5408\u632f\u8361\u5668(Ising\u673a\u5668)\u5b9e\u73b0McDonald\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u6458\u8981\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660eIsing\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u6458\u8981\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}
