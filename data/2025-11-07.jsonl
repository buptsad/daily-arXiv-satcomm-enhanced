This work develops a hybrid quantum-classical\ndetection framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted\nsingle-carrier (SC) frequency-domain equalization (FDE) over\nfrequency-selective channels. The ML detection objective is reformulated as a\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and solved via\nGrover adaptive search (GAS). To accelerate convergence, we introduce a\nfrequency-domain MMSE threshold that exploits the circulant structure of SC-FDE\nchannels, yielding low-complexity initialization. The framework is evaluated\nacross varying channel lengths and RIS sizes, confirming robustness and\nscalability. In addition, GAS requirements are quantified through register\nwidths and gate counts, and its query complexity is analyzed to characterize\nthe algorithm's cost for block transmission in frequency-selective channels.\nQuantum circuit simulations are conducted in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy\nconditions. In the ideal case, the detector achieves near-optimal performance\nwhile benefiting from Grover's quadratic speedup, reducing the search cost from\nfrom O(M^N) exhaustive evaluations to O(SQRT(M^N)) oracle queries. Under noise,\nthe shallow depth of the GAS circuits, aided by MMSE initialization, makes\ndepolarizing errors negligible, while readout errors introduce moderate\ndegradation yet still preserve performance close to the MMSE baseline. These\nresults establish the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detection for\nRIS-assisted broadband communications, highlighting both algorithmic\nscalability and practical robustness for 6G networks."}

While DCQCN provides a\nscalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is\nslow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources\n(which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it\ndiminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios\nidentification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network\nresource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called\nImproved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so\nthat the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN\nmarking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being\nmarked.

We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence.

However, generating comments\nthat are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting\nstylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.\nWe introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for\ncontrollable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video\nsegmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt\nconstruction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),\nrhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content\nextraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style\nconformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and\n105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms\nbaseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on\nYouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for\nstylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path\nto enhance user engagement and creative interaction."}

To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%.

This\nstudy addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks\nthat recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit\nmodels. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via\nXGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation\nreweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP\nrebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate\ncalibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked\nagainst static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,\nF1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness\n(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,\nparticularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially\nimprove temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic\ngroups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including\ncounterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and\nproxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under\nreal-world drift conditions.

In this work, we\nfocus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.\nWhereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing\nan isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use\ndata-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new\nalternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor\ndecompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike\nconventional compression pipelines, which almost always require\npost-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves\ncompetitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same\ncovariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only\na minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training\ndataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,\nand GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)\nconfirm the advantages of the proposed method."}

To be\nbroadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range\nspatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also\nsupporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph\nPerceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning\nthat leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently\nintegrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent\nbottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common\nlatent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire\nrelational system.

Extensive validations on modified IEEE\n9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance,\nachieving 99.85\\%, 99.90\\%, and 99.69\\% average accuracies, respectively,\nsurpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning\nalgorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal\ncombinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\\% without\nperformance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for\nsmall-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across\ndifferent stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while\nproviding enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it\nsuitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers."}

Shannon\nentropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information\nencoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,\nand Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information\nencoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding\nsimilarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was\nintroduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,\nand which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,\nanalytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an\nupper bound on LCR for several values of the R\\'enyi-Hill order parameter and\nconjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is\npreferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more\nfundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a\nquantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks\nsimply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;\nnevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each\nother."}

These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a\n32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline.

By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nlayers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently\nencodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space.
