Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered\nconsiderable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.\nHowever, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those\nbased on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to\nreference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code\nmultiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high\ncomputational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook\ndesigns. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain\nnon-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for\nvehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is\ndesigned to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline\ntraining, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference\nsignal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction\narchitecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain\ninformation of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic\nchannels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior\nperformance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit\nerror rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower\ncomputational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided\nschemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular\ncommunications."}

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism.

While\nexisting congestion control algorithms like TCP BBR do tend to perform better\neven in the presence of large bottleneck buffers, they still tend to fill the\nbuffer more than necessary and can have fairness issues when compared to\nloss-based algorithms.\n  In this paper, we analyze the issues with the use of loss-based congestion\ncontrol algorithms by analyzing TCP CUBIC, which is currently the most popular\nvariant. To mitigate the issues experienced by TCP CUBIC in cellular networks,\nwe introduce TCP ROCCET, a latency-based extension of TCP CUBIC that responds\nto network congestion based on round-trip time in addition to packet loss.\n  Our findings show that TCP ROCCET can reduce latency and bufferbloat compared\nto the standard CUBIC implementation, without requiring a specific network\narchitecture. Compared to TCP BBRv3, ROCCET offers similar throughput while\nmaintaining lower overall latency. The evaluation was conducted in real 5G\nnetworks, including both stationary and mobile scenarios, confirming ROCCET's\nimproved response to network congestion under varying conditions."}

When a high level decision making\nagent generates a collision free path, a robust low level controller is\nrequired to precisely follow this trajectory. However, connected autonomous\nvehicles (CAV) are inherently affected by communication delays and computation\ndelays, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional controllers\nsuch as PID or other more advanced controllers like disturbance observers\n(DOB). While DOB-based designs have shown effectiveness in rejecting\ndisturbances under nominal conditions, their performance deteriorates\nconsiderably in the presence of unknown time delays. To address this challenge,\nthis paper proposes a delay-tolerant communication disturbance observer (CDOB)\nframework for path-tracking control in delayed systems. The proposed CDOB\ncompensates for the adverse effects of time delays, maintaining accurate\ntrajectory tracking even under uncertain and varying delay conditions.

To\naddress this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention\ncollaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first\nemploys a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across\nboth temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight\nConformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where\nthe feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter\noverhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand\nthe receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel\nsize. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba\nmodule is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of\ntemporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining\nself-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a\ncollaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation\ncapacity and computational efficiency.

(2025) achieved scalable computation by\nrelating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains\nintrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to\nincorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the\nlens of \\emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to\ncapture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in\noptimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and\ngeneralized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing\nmachine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical\nSobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors\nbeyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant\ncomputational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To\naddress these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between\nOrlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization\nfor the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying\ngraph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces\nto a simple \\emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably\ncomputational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the\npopular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in\ncomparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and\nseveral tasks in topological data analysis."}

As a case\nstudy, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable\nrunners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory\nfeedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN,\n1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient\ninference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our\ncustom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor\nrunning sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment\npipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and\nhardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized\n1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just\n0.350 {\\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running\nat 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference\non a 320 mAh battery.

Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered\nconsiderable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.\nHowever, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those\nbased on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to\nreference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code\nmultiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high\ncomputational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook\ndesigns. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain\nnon-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for\nvehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is\ndesigned to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline\ntraining, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference\nsignal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction\narchitecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain\ninformation of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic\nchannels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior\nperformance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit\nerror rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower\ncomputational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided\nschemes.

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to\nsequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can\ncollectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally. These\nfindings underscore the need for new privacy-preserving frameworks that\nexplicitly model temporal dependencies, such as time-aware differential privacy\nor sequential data obfuscation strategies."}
