We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u81ea\u751f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5371\u9669\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u4f5c\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u71b5\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\uff08CTM\uff09\u6765\u9003\u79bb\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u51fa\u73b0\u71b5\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4e0b\u540c\u6837\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eaf\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u800c\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints.

However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude.

In this regime, we establish tight or near-tight bounds on the maximum code size. In particular, we determine the exact optimal code sizes for $t=n-1$ and for $t=n-2$, develop a refined analysis for $t=n-3$, and derive a general recursive puncturing upper bound for $t=n-k$ via a reduction from parameters $(n,k)$ to $(n-1,k-1)$.\n  On the constructive side, we completely resolve the binary multiset model: for all $t\\ge1$ we determine $S_2(n,t)$ exactly and give an explicit optimal congruence-based construction. We then study single-deletion codes beyond the binary case, presenting general $q$-ary constructions and showing, via explicit small-parameter examples, that the natural modular construction need not be optimal for $q\\ge3$.

However, the practical effectiveness of existing attacks is undermined by several critical limitations: they struggle to maintain a coherent progression over long interactions, often losing track of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done; they rely on rigid or pre-defined patterns, and fail to adapt to the LLM's dynamic and unpredictable conversational state. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings. Moreover, our framework exhibits notable resilience against multiple advanced defense mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mastermind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6211\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9632\u5fa1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u8f6e\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u957f\u5468\u671f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u95ed\u73af\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u628a\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u653b\u51fb\u6b65\u9aa4\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u7cbe\u70bc\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u7ec4\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT\u20115\u3001Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u7b49\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cMastermind\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "conclusion": "Mastermind\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u811a\u672c\u7834\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u4e0e CMA\u2011ES \u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406/\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u5bfc\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 Forman\u2011Ricci \u66f2\u7387\u6355\u83b7\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\uff0cDeep Delta Learning \u7ef4\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u6295\u5f71\u65f6\u7684\u79e9\u4e00\u6270\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08CMA\u2011ES\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u91cf\u964d\u81f3 1.15\uff08\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf 11.68\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97 95% \u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u79cd\u5b50\u65e0\u5173\u6536\u655b\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u9075\u5b88\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This work is going to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Non-contact radar-based human sensing is often interpreted using simplified motion assumptions. However, respiration induces non-rigid surface deformation of the human body that impacts electromagnetic wave scattering and can degrade the robustness of measurements. To address this, we propose a surface-deformation-aware observation model for radar-based human sensing that fuses static high-resolution three-dimensional scanner measurements with temporal depth camera data to represent time-varying human surface geometry. Non-rigid registration using the coherent point drift algorithm is employed to align a static template with dynamic depth frames. Frame-wise electromagnetic scattering is subsequently computed using the physical optics approximation, allowing the reconstruction of intermediate-frequency radar signals that emulate radar observations. Validation against experimental radar data demonstrated that the proposed model exhibited greater robustness than a depth-sequence-only model under low-signal-quality conditions involving complex surface dynamics and multiple reflective sites. For two participants, the proposed model achieved higher Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.943 and 0.887 between model-derived and experimentally measured displacement waveforms, compared with 0.868 and 0.796 for the depth-sequence-only model. Furthermore, in a favorable case characterized by a single relatively-stationary reflective site, the proposed method achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.789 between model-derived and experimentally measured in-phase-quadrature magnitude variations. These results suggest that our sensor-fusion-based deformation-aware observation modeling can realistically reproduce radar observations and provide physically grounded insights into the interpretation of radar measurement variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u626b\u63cf\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6444\u50cf\u7684\u975e\u521a\u6027\u914d\u51c6+\u7269\u7406\u5149\u5b66\u6563\u5c04\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91cd\u73b0\u96f7\u8fbe\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u547c\u5438\u7b49\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u51fa\u73b0\u975e\u521a\u6027\u5f62\u53d8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u5f62\u53d8\u5f71\u54cd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5e72\u70b9\u6f02\u79fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e27\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u521a\u6027\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u5e27\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5149\u5b66\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u9891\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f7\u8fbe\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4f4d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u5f97\u4f4d\u79fb\u6ce2\u5f62\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.943\u4e0e0.887\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u76840.868\u548c0.796\uff1b\u5355\u4e00\u76f8\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u53cd\u5c04\u70b9\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea6\u8fbe\u52300.789 \u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u5e45\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u9759\u6001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e09\u7ef4\u626b\u63cf\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u6444\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u96f7\u8fbe\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u3001\u590d\u6742\u8868\u9762\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u53cd\u5c04\u70b9\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u6d4b\u95f4\u7684\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u9ad8\u8fbe0.943\u548c0.887\u3002"}}

The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system.

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "EquFL\uff1a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u5355\u4e00\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u540e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eEquFL\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u7f13\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "EquFL\u5728FL\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u66f4\u65b0\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u4e0eFedAvg\u6536\u655b\u5230\u540c\u6837\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u9f50\u6b21\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u9650/\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u9650/\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u9f50\u6b21\u6027\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5173\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u62c9\u4f38\u7684\u9f50\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u9006\u5411Lyapunov\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u9f50\u6b21\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6247\u5f62\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u9f50\u6b21\u5750\u6807\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u9f50\u6b21\u9759\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u5668", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9f50\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u79bb\u6563\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9f50\u6b21\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6839\u636e\u9f50\u6b21\u5ea6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8fd1\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u6307\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u9f50\u6b21\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u9f50\u6b21\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6"}}

We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters.

However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis.

However, advancements in quantum computing threaten the security of classical cryptographic schemes, jeopardizing blockchain integrity once cryptographic quantum supremacy is achieved. This milestone, defined here as the realization of quantum computers to solve practical cryptographic problems, would render existing security standards vulnerable, exposing blockchain assets (currency, data, etc.) to fraud and theft. To address this risk, we propose and implement a smart contract deployable on the Ethereum blockchain, having the ability to run applications on its blockchain, that generates classically intractable puzzles by probabilistically generating large, hard-to-factor numbers without requiring secret information. This contract then serves two purposes: to establish a mechanism (1) for a trustless, unbiased proof of cryptographic quantum supremacy by verifying solutions to these puzzles, and (2) to protect user funds on Ethereum by triggering quantum-secure fallback protocols upon detecting cryptographic quantum supremacy, since it is desirable to wait as long as possible to fall back to a quantum-secure scheme because of its inherent additional cost and complexity. These mechanisms demonstrate the ability to identify cryptographic vulnerabilities and ensure a smooth transition to quantum-secure standards, safeguarding blockchain assets in a post-quantum era.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit lexical and syntax perturbations, allowing critical flaws to evade detection. Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy.

Assuming that the function is decomposed into an arbitrary subfunction set $\\mathbf{X}$, with each subfunction depending on $d$ input files, renders our distributed computing problem into a $d$-uniform hypergraph edge partitioning problem wherein the edge set (subfunction set), defined by $d$-wise dependencies between vertices (files) must be partitioned across $N$ disjoint groups (workers). The aim is to design a file and subfunction allocation, corresponding to a partition of $\\mathbf{X}$, that minimizes the communication cost $\u03c0_{\\mathbf{X}}$, representing the maximum number of distinct files per server, while also minimizing the computation cost $\u03b4_{\\mathbf{X}}$ corresponding to a maximal worker subfunction load. For a broad range of parameters, we propose a deterministic allocation solution, the \\emph{Interweaved-Cliques (IC) design}, whose information-theoretic-inspired interweaved clique structure simultaneously achieves order-optimal communication and computation costs, for a large class of decompositions $\\mathbf{X}$. This optimality is derived from our achievability and converse bounds, which reveal -- under reasonable assumptions on the density of $\\mathbf{X}$ -- that the optimal scaling of the communication cost takes the form $n/N^{1/d}$, revealing that our design achieves the order-optimal \\textit{partitioning gain} that scales as $N^{1/d}$, while also achieving an order-optimal computation cost.

Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts.

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints.

We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent.

Many studies assume ideal wireless conditions or focus only on path planning, neglecting the challenge of making real-time decisions in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we address the problem of adaptive sensor selection for a data-gathering UAV, considering both the buffered data at each sensor and realistic propagation conditions. We introduce the Hover-based Greedy Adaptive Download (HGAD) strategy, designed to maximize data transfer by intelligently hovering over sensors during periods of peak signal quality. We validate HGAD using both a digital twin (DT) and a real-world (RW) testbed at the NSF-funded AERPAW platform. Our experiments show that HGAD significantly improves download stability and successfully meets per-sensor data targets. When compared with the traditional Greedy approach that simply follows the strongest signal, HGAD is shown to outperform in the cumulative data download.

To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches.

The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data.

Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability.

We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders.

To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago.

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeMa\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5Mamba\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1SOTA\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "Transformers\u5728MTS\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cMamba\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8de8\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u5185/\u8de8\u5217\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5Mamba\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u2460\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aintra\u2011series\u52a8\u6001\u4e0einter\u2011series\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u2461\u4f7f\u7528Mamba\u2011SSD\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u7a0b\u81ea\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u2462\u91c7\u7528Mamba\u2011DALA\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u4e94\u9879\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDeMa\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387/\u53ec\u56de/MAE\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u52bf", "conclusion": "DeMa\u5728\u7ef4\u6301Mamba\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\u65b0\u4e00\u8f6e\u7684SOTA\u6c34\u5e73"}}

This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens.

In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation.

However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series.

Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance.

However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \\underline{F}lexible \\underline{L}ow-\\underline{R}ank \\underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC).

Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases.

In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits.

Code and reproduction materials available on GitHub", "summary": "Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only.

Each observation is first reconstructed as a linear combination of the other samples in the RKHS, by optimizing a vector form of the Representer Theorem for their autorepresentation property. A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory.

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms.

Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets.

Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories.

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u7684PAC\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528SP\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u53ef\u9760\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5d4c\u5165\u793e\u4f1a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u968f\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6613\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u64cd\u7eb5\u7834\u574f\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePAC\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u7684Empirical Property Optimization\uff08EPO\uff09oracle\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u6784\u5efaSP\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08Statistical Parity Dimension\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u6790\u54ea\u4e9b\u66f4\u65b0\u4fdd\u6301\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u8bef\u5dee\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u5ba1\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165SP\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548cEPO\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u5b8c\u6210\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer.

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment.

Experimental results show that our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.967% on the public dataset and 2.624% on the private dataset, significantly outperforming traditional calibration and non-transferred machine learning baselines. Moreover, using 25Hz PPG reduces power consumption by 40% compared to 100Hz, excluding baseline draw.

In this study, we enforce subject-level data splitting on a public multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) dataset and propose a generalizable BP estimation framework based on curriculum-adversarial learning. Our approach combines curriculum learning, which transitions from hypertension classification to BP regression, with domain-adversarial training that confuses subject identity to encourage the learning of subject-invariant features. Experiments show that multi-channel fusion consistently outperforms single-channel models. On the four-wavelength PPG dataset, our method achieves strong performance under strict subject-level splitting, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 14.2mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 6.4mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the curriculum and adversarial components. These results highlight the potential of leveraging complementary information in multi-wavelength PPG and curriculum-adversarial strategies for accurate and robust BP estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b-\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60+\u591a\u901a\u9053\u878d\u5408\u7684PPG\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7ea7\u5212\u5206\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230MAE 14.2/6.4 mmHg\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u826f\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4e00\u5149\u8c31\u6216\u5355\u901a\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u8840\u538b\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6a21\u5757\u6291\u5236\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u901a\u9053\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u6ce2\u957fPPG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f97\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u4e3aSBP 14.2 mmHg\u3001DBP 6.4 mmHg\uff1b\u591a\u901a\u9053\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u901a\u9053\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u9879\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u63cf\u8bb0\uff08PPG\uff09\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7ea7\u62c6\u5206\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8840\u538b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8840\u538b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}
